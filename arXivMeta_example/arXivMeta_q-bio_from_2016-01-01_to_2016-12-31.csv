0704.3771	q-bio	q-bio.PE q-bio.MN	Primordial Evolution in the Finitary Process Soup	"  A general and basic model of primordial evolution--a soup of reacting
finitary and discrete processes--is employed to identify and analyze
fundamental mechanisms that generate and maintain complex structures in
prebiotic systems. The processes--$\epsilon$-machines as defined in
computational mechanics--and their interaction networks both provide well
defined notions of structure. This enables us to quantitatively demonstrate
hierarchical self-organization in the soup in terms of complexity. We found
that replicating processes evolve the strategy of successively building higher
levels of organization by autocatalysis. Moreover, this is facilitated by local
components that have low structural complexity, but high generality. In effect,
the finitary process soup spontaneously evolves a selection pressure that
favors such components. In light of the finitary process soup's generality,
these results suggest a fundamental law of hierarchical systems: global
complexity requires local simplicity.

dynamics of a predator-prey system. The local rules are Markovian and are based
in the Lotka-Volterra model. The individuals of each species reside on the
sites of a lattice and interact with an unsymmetrical neighborhood. We look for
the effect of the space anisotropy in the characterization of the oscillations
of the species population densities. Our study of the probabilistic cellular
automaton is based on simple and pair mean-field approximations and explicitly
takes into account spatial anisotropy.

0705.1548	q-bio	q-bio.OT	Dimensionality and dynamics in the behavior of C. elegans	"  A major challenge in analyzing animal behavior is to discover some underlying
simplicity in complex motor actions. Here we show that the space of shapes
adopted by the nematode C. elegans is surprisingly low dimensional, with just
four dimensions accounting for 95% of the shape variance, and we partially
reconstruct ""equations of motion"" for the dynamics in this space. These
dynamics have multiple attractors, and we find that the worm visits these in a
rapid and almost completely deterministic response to weak thermal stimuli.
Stimulus-dependent correlations among the different modes suggest that one can
generate more reliable behaviors by synchronizing stimuli to the state of the
worm in shape space. We confirm this prediction, effectively ""steering"" the
worm in real time.

of years and in an amazing variety of circumstances. At its core is a system
for acquiring, processing and communicating information that is universal, from
viruses and bacteria to human beings. Advances in genetics and experience in
designing computers have taken us to a stage where we can understand the
optimisation principles at the root of this system, from the availability of
basic building blocks to the execution of tasks. The languages of DNA and
proteins are argued to be the optimal solutions to the information processing
tasks they carry out. The analysis also suggests simpler predecessors to these
languages, and provides fascinating clues about their origin. Obviously, a
comprehensive unraveling of the puzzle of life would have a lot to say about
what we may design or convert ourselves into.

0706.3177	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Role of homeostasis in learning sparse representations	"  Neurons in the input layer of primary visual cortex in primates develop
edge-like receptive fields. One approach to understanding the emergence of this
response is to state that neural activity has to efficiently represent sensory
data with respect to the statistics of natural scenes. Furthermore, it is
believed that such an efficient coding is achieved using a competition across
neurons so as to generate a sparse representation, that is, where a relatively
small number of neurons are simultaneously active. Indeed, different models of
sparse coding, coupled with Hebbian learning and homeostasis, have been
proposed that successfully match the observed emergent response. However, the
specific role of homeostasis in learning such sparse representations is still
largely unknown. By quantitatively assessing the efficiency of the neural
representation during learning, we derive a cooperative homeostasis mechanism
that optimally tunes the competition between neurons within the sparse coding
algorithm. We apply this homeostasis while learning small patches taken from
natural images and compare its efficiency with state-of-the-art algorithms.
Results show that while different sparse coding algorithms give similar coding
results, the homeostasis provides an optimal balance for the representation of
natural images within the population of neurons. Competition in sparse coding
is optimized when it is fair. By contributing to optimizing statistical
competition across neurons, homeostasis is crucial in providing a more
efficient solution to the emergence of independent components.

0707.1078	q-bio	cond-mat.soft q-bio.CB	Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Vascular Network Formation	"  Endothelial cells are responsible for the formation of the capillary blood
vessel network. We describe a system of endothelial cells by means of
two-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations of point-like particles. Cells'
motion is governed by the gradient of the concentration of a chemical substance
that they produce (chemotaxis). The typical time of degradation of the chemical
substance introduces a characteristic length in the system. We show that
point-like model cells form network resembling structures tuned by this
characteristic length, before collapsing altogether. Successively, we improve
the non-realistic point-like model cells by introducing an isotropic strong
repulsive force between them and a velocity dependent force mimicking the
observed peculiarity of endothelial cells to preserve the direction of their
motion (persistence). This more realistic model does not show a clear network
formation. We ascribe this partial fault in reproducing the experiments to the
static geometry of our model cells that, in reality, change their shapes by
elongating toward neighboring cells.

delay the extinction of plasmids in a plasmid replication system: a
prototypical biochemical regulatory network. We calculate the probability
distribution of the metastable state of the plasmids and show on this example
that the reaction rate equations may fail in predicting the average number of
regulated molecules even when this number is large, and the time is much
shorter than the mean extinction time.

  of competing Boolean nodes"	"  The effects of the finite size of the network on the evolutionary dynamics of
a Boolean network are analyzed. In the model considered, Boolean networks
evolve via a competition between nodes that punishes those in the majority. It
is found that finite size networks evolve in a fundamentally different way than
infinitely large networks do. The symmetry of the evolutionary dynamics of
infinitely large networks that selects for canalizing Boolean functions is
broken in the evolutionary dynamics of finite size networks. In finite size
networks there is an additional selection for input inverting Boolean functions
that output a value opposite to the majority of input values. These results are
revealed through an empirical study of the model that calculates the frequency
of occurrence of the different possible Boolean functions. Classes of functions
are found to occur with the same frequency. Those classes depend on the
symmetry of the evolutionary dynamics and correspond to orbits of the relevant
symmetry group. The empirical results match analytic results, determined by
utilizing Polya's theorem, for the number of orbits expected in both finite
size and infinitely large networks. The reason for the symmetry breaking in the
evolutionary dynamics is found to be due to the need for nodes in finite size
networks to behave differently in order to cooperate so that the system
collectively performs as well as possible. The results suggest that both finite
size effects and symmetry are important for understanding the evolution of
real-world complex networks, including genetic regulatory networks.

0712.0744	q-bio	cs.MA cs.AI q-bio.PE q-bio.QM	Computational Chemotaxis in Ants and Bacteria over Dynamic Environments	"  Chemotaxis can be defined as an innate behavioural response by an organism to
a directional stimulus, in which bacteria, and other single-cell or
multicellular organisms direct their movements according to certain chemicals
in their environment. This is important for bacteria to find food (e.g.,
glucose) by swimming towards the highest concentration of food molecules, or to
flee from poisons. Based on self-organized computational approaches and similar
stigmergic concepts we derive a novel swarm intelligent algorithm. What strikes
from these observations is that both eusocial insects as ant colonies and
bacteria have similar natural mechanisms based on stigmergy in order to emerge
coherent and sophisticated patterns of global collective behaviour. Keeping in
mind the above characteristics we will present a simple model to tackle the
collective adaptation of a social swarm based on real ant colony behaviors (SSA
algorithm) for tracking extrema in dynamic environments and highly multimodal
complex functions described in the well-know De Jong test suite. Later, for the
purpose of comparison, a recent model of artificial bacterial foraging (BFOA
algorithm) based on similar stigmergic features is described and analyzed.
Final results indicate that the SSA collective intelligence is able to cope and
quickly adapt to unforeseen situations even when over the same cooperative
foraging period, the community is requested to deal with two different and
contradictory purposes, while outperforming BFOA in adaptive speed. Results
indicate that the present approach deals well in severe Dynamic Optimization
problems.

  remain stable with advanced age: A new mechanistic picture of cardiac control
  in healthy elderly"	"  We analyze heartbeat interval recordings from two independent databases: (a)
19 healthy young (avg. age 25.7 years) and 16 healthy elderly subjects (avg.
age 73.8 years) during 2h under resting conditions from the Fantasia database;
and (b) 29 healthy elderly subjects (avg. age 75.9 years) during $\approx{}8$h
of sleep from the SHHS database, and the same subjects recorded 5 years later.
We quantify: (1) The average heart rate <RR>; (2) the SD $\sigma_{RR}$ and
$\sigma_{\Delta{}RR}$ of the heartbeat intervals RR and their increments
$\Delta{}RR$; (3) the long-range correlations in RR as measured by the scaling
exponent $\alpha_{RR}$ using the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis; (4) fractal
linear and nonlinear properties as represented by the scaling exponents
$\alpha^{sign}$ and $\alpha^{mag}$ for the time series of the sign and
magnitude of $\Delta{}RR$; (5) the nonlinear fractal dimension $D(k)$ of $RR$
using the Fractal Dimension Analysis. We find: (1) No significant difference in
$\left<RR\right>$ (P>0.05); (2) a significant difference in $\sigma_{RR}$ and
$\sigma_{\Delta{}RR}$ for the Fantasia groups (P<10^{-4}) but no significant
change with age between the elderly SHHS groups (P>0.5); (3) no significant
change in the fractal measures $\alpha_{RR}$ (P>0.15), $\alpha^{sign}$ (P>0.2),
$\alpha^{mag}$ (P>0.3), and D(k) with age. Our findings do not support the
hypothesis that fractal linear and nonlinear characteristics of heartbeat
dynamics break down with advanced age in healthy subjects. While our results
indeed show a reduced SD of heartbeat fluctuations with advanced age, the
inherent temporal fractal and nonlinear organization of these fluctuations
remains stable.

(MaxEnt) in one method, the method of Maximum (relative) Entropy (ME) (Giffin
2007). In this paper we show a complex agent based example of inference with
two different forms of information; moments and data. In this example, several
agents each receive partial information about a system in the form of data. In
addition, each agent agrees or is informed that there are certain global
constraints on the system that are always true. The agents are then asked to
make inferences about the entire system. The system becomes more complex as we
add agents and allow them to share information. This system can have a
geometrical form, such as a crystal structure. The shape may dictate how the
agents are able to share information, such as sharing with nearest neighbors.
This method can be used to model many systems where the agents or cells have
local or partial information but must adhere to some global rules. This could
also illustrate how the agents evolve and could illuminate emergent behavior of
the system.

  Absence of Detailed Balance. II: construction of SDS with nonlinear force and
  multiplicative noise"	"  There is a whole range of emergent phenomena in non-equilibrium behaviors can
be well described by a set of stochastic differential equations. Inspired by an
insight gained during our study of robustness and stability in phage lambda
genetic switch in modern biology, we found that there exists a classification
of generic nonequilibrium processes: In the continuous description in terms of
stochastic differential equations, there exists four dynamical elements: the
potential function $\phi$, the friction matrix $ S$, the anti-symmetric matrix
$ T $, and the noise. The generic feature of absence of detailed balance is
then precisely represented by $T$. For dynamical near a fixed point, whether or
not it is stable or not, the stochastic dynamics is linear. A rather complete
analysis has been carried out (Kwon, Ao, Thouless, cond-mat/0506280; PNAS, {\bf
102} (2005) 13029), referred to as SDS I. One important and persistent question
is the existence of a potential function with nonlinear force and with
multiplicative noise, with both nice local dynamical and global steady state
properties. Here we demonstrate that a dynamical structure built into
stochastic differential equation allows us to construct such a global
optimization potential function. First, we provide the construction. One of
most important ingredient is the generalized Einstein relation. We then present
an approximation scheme: The gradient expansion which turns every order into
linear matrix equations. The consistent of such methodology with other known
stochastic treatments will be discussed in next paper, SDS III; and the
explicitly connection to statistical mechanics and thermodynamics will be
discussed in a forthcoming paper, SDS IV.

  Absence of Detailed Balance. III: potential function in local stochastic
  dynamics and in steady state of Boltzmann-Gibbs type distribution function"	"  From a logic point of view this is the third in the series to solve the
problem of absence of detailed balance. This paper will be denoted as SDS III.
The existence of a dynamical potential with both local and global meanings in
general nonequilibrium processes has been controversial. Following an earlier
explicit construction by one of us (Ao, J. Phys. {\bf A37}, L25 '04,
arXiv:0803.4356, referred to as SDS II), in the present paper we show
rigorously its existence for a generic class of situations in physical and
biological sciences. The local dynamical meaning of this potential function is
demonstrated via a special stochastic differential equation and its global
steady-state meaning via a novel and explicit form of Fokker-Planck equation,
the zero mass limit. We also give a procedure to obtain the special stochastic
differential equation for any given Fokker-Planck equation. No detailed balance
condition is required in our demonstration. For the first time we obtain here a
formula to describe the noise induced shift in drift force comparing to the
steady state distribution, a phenomenon extensively observed in numerical
studies. The comparison to two well known stochastic integration methods, Ito
and Stratonovich, are made ready. Such comparison was made elsewhere (Ao, Phys.
Life Rev. {\bf 2} (2005) 117. q-bio/0605020).

  random-completion problem"	"  DNA synthesis in \textit{Xenopus} frog embryos initiates stochastically in
time at many sites (origins) along the chromosome. Stochastic initiation
implies fluctuations in the time to complete and may lead to cell death if
replication takes longer than the cell cycle time ($\approx 25$ min).
Surprisingly, although the typical replication time is about 20 min, \textit{in
vivo} experiments show that replication fails to complete only about 1 in 300
times. How is replication timing accurately controlled despite the
stochasticity? Biologists have proposed two solutions to this
""random-completion problem."" The first solution uses randomly located origins
but increases their rate of initiation as S phase proceeds, while the second
uses regularly spaced origins. In this paper, we investigate the
random-completion problem using a type of model first developed to describe the
kinetics of first-order phase transitions. Using methods from the field of
extreme-value statistics, we derive the distribution of replication-completion
times for a finite genome. We then argue that the biologists' first solution to
the problem is not only consistent with experiment but also nearly optimizes
the use of replicative proteins. We also show that spatial regularity in origin
placement does not alter significantly the distribution of replication times
and, thus, is not needed for the control of replication timing.

  Paleobiology Database"	"  Time series analysis of fossil biodiversity of marine invertebrates in the
Paleobiology Database (PBDB) shows a significant periodicity at approximately
63 My, in agreement with previous analyses based on the Sepkoski database. I
discuss how this result did not appear in a previous analysis of the PBDB. The
existence of the 63 My periodicity, despite very different treatment of
systematic error in both PBDB and Sepkoski databases strongly argues for
consideration of its reality in the fossil record. Cross-spectral analysis of
the two datasets finds that a 62 My periodicity coincides in phase by 1.6 My,
equivalent to better than the errors in either measurement. Consequently, the
two data sets not only contain the same strong periodicity, but its peaks and
valleys closely correspond in time. Two other spectral peaks appear in the PBDB
analysis, but appear to be artifacts associated with detrending and with the
increased interval length. Sampling-standardization procedures implemented by
the PBDB collaboration suggest that the signal is not an artifact of sampling
bias. Further work should focus on finding the cause of the 62 My periodicity.

generating upto 100,000 overlapping reads in a single run. This technique is
much faster and cheaper than the existing state of the art sequencing technique
such as Sanger. However, the reads generated by pyrosequencing are short in
size and contain numerous errors. Furthermore, each read has a specific
position in the reference genome. In order to use these reads for any
subsequent analysis, the reads must be aligned . Existing multiple sequence
alignment methods cannot be used as they do not take into account the specific
positions of the sequences with respect to the genome, and are highly
inefficient for large number of sequences. Therefore, the common practice has
been to use either simple pairwise alignment despite its poor accuracy for
error prone pyroreads, or use computationally expensive techniques based on
sequential gap propagation. In this paper, we develop a computationally
efficient method based on domain decomposition, referred to as pyro-align, to
align such large number of reads. The proposed alignment algorithm accurately
aligns the erroneous reads in a short period of time, which is orders of
magnitude faster than any existing method. The accuracy of the alignment is
confirmed from the consensus obtained from the multiple alignments.

using solely information contained in the sequence itself. The PRED-TMR
algorithm described, refines a standard hydrophobicity analysis with a
detection of potential termini ('edges', starts and ends) of transmembrane
regions. This allows one both to discard highly hydrophobic regions not
delimited by clear start and end configurations and to confirm putative
transmembrane segments not distinguishable by their hydrophobic composition.
The accuracy obtained on a test set of 101 non-homologous transmembrane
proteins with reliable topologies compares well with that of other popular
existing methods. Only a slight decrease in prediction accuracy was observed
when the algorithm was applied to all transmembrane proteins of the SwissProt

proteins into two classes from their sequences alone: the membrane protein
class and the non-membrane protein class. This may be important in the
functional assignment and analysis of open reading frames (ORF's) identified in
complete genomes and, especially, those ORF's that correspond to proteins with
unknown function. The network described here has a simple hierarchical
feed-forward topology and a limited number of neurons which makes it very fast.
By using only information contained in 11 protein sequences, the method was
able to identify, with 100% accuracy, all membrane proteins with reliable
topologies collected from several papers in the literature. Applied to a test
set of 995 globular, water-soluble proteins, the neural network classified
falsely 23 of them in the membrane protein class (97.7% of correct assignment).
The method was also applied to the complete SWISS-PROT database with
considerable success and on ORF's of several complete genomes. The neural
network developed was associated with the PRED-TMR algorithm (Pasquier,C.,
Promponas,V.J., Palaios,G.A., Hamodrakas,J.S. and Hamodrakas,S.J., 1999) in a

(LCS) and Shortest Common Supersequences (SCS) represent different aspects of
these sequences profile, and they can all be used for biological sequence
comparisons and analysis. Revealing the relationship between the patterns and
LCS,SCS might provide us with a deeper view of the patterns of biological
sequences, in turn leading to better understanding of them. However, There is
no careful examinaton about the relationship between patterns, LCS and SCS. In
this paper, we have analyzed their relation, and given some lemmas. Based on
their relations, a set of algorithms called the PALS (PAtterns by Lcs and Scs)
algorithms are propsoed to discover patterns in a set of biological sequences.
These algorithms first generate the results for LCS and SCS of sequences by
heuristic, and consequently derive patterns from these results. Experiments
show that the PALS algorithms perform well (both in efficiency and in accuracy)
on a variety of sequences. The PALS approach also provides us with a solution
for transforming between the heuristic results of SCS and LCS.

ecologists where predator-prey interactions have to be taken into account the
process of predation search. In this paper we study the conditions of the
existence and stability properties of the equilibrium solutions in a
reaction-diffusion model in which predator mortality is neither a constant nor
an unbounded function, but it is increasing with the predator abundance. We
show that analytically at a certain critical value a diffusion driven (Turing
type) instability occurs, i.e. the stationary solution stays stable with
respect to the kinetic system (the system without diffusion). We also show that
the stationary solution becomes unstable with respect to the system with
diffusion and that Turing bifurcation takes place: a spatially non-homogenous
(non-constant) solution (structure or pattern) arises. A numerical scheme that
preserve the positivity of the numerical solutions and the boundedness of prey
solution will be presented. Numerical examples are also included.

from single nucleosome to nucleosomal array by using a unique combination of
biochemical assays, single molecule imaging technique and numerical modeling.
We demonstrate that a subtle modification in the nucleosome structure induced
by the histone variant H2A.Bbd drastically modifies the higher order
organization of the nucleosomal arrays. Importantly, as directly visualized by
AFM, conventional H2A nucleosomal arrays exhibit specific local organization,
in contrast to H2A.Bbd arrays, which show ""beads on a string"" structure. The
combination of systematic image analysis and theoretical modeling allows a
quantitative description relating the observed gross structural changes of the
arrays to their local organization. Our results strongly suggest that
higher-order organization of H1-free nucleosomal arrays is mainly determined by
the fluctuation properties of individual nucleosomes. Moreover, numerical
simulations suggest the existence of attractive interactions between
nucleosomes to provide the degree of compaction observed for conventional
chromatin fibers.

  gradient"	"  Nanopores spanning synthetic membranes have been used as key components in
proof-of-principle nanofluidic applications, particularly those involving
manipulation of biomolecules or sequencing of DNA. The only practical way of
manipulating charged macromolecules near nanopores is through a voltage
difference applied across the nanopore-spanning membrane. However, recent
experiments have shown that salt concentration gradients applied across
nanopores can also dramatically enhance charged particle capture from a low
concentration reservoir of charged molecules at one end of the nanopore. This
puzzling effect has hitherto eluded a physically consistent theoretical
explanation. Here, we propose an electrokinetic mechanism of this enhanced
capture that relies on the electrostatic potential near the pore mouth. For
long pores with diameter much greater than the local screening length, we
obtain accurate analytic expressions showing how salt gradients control the
local conductivity which can lead to increased local electrostatic potentials
and charged analyte capture rates. We also find that the attractive
electrostatic potential may be balanced by an outward, repulsive electroosmotic
flow (EOF) that can in certain cases conspire with the salt gradient to further
enhance the analyte capture rate.

  models"	"  Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) models are a popular and powerful tool for
describing encoding (stimulus-response) transformations by single sensory as
well as motor neurons. Recently, there has been rising interest in the second-
and higher-order correlation structure of neural spike trains, and how it may
be related to specific encoding relationships. The distortion of signal
correlations as they are transformed through particular LNP models is
predictable and in some cases analytically tractable and invertible. Here, we
propose that LNP encoding models can potentially be identified strictly from
the correlation transformations they induce, and develop a computational method
for identifying minimum-phase single-neuron temporal kernels under white and
colored- random Gaussian excitation. Unlike reverse-correlation or
maximum-likelihood, correlation-distortion based identification does not
require the simultaneous observation of stimulus-response pairs - only their
respective second order statistics. Although in principle filter kernels are
not necessarily minimum-phase, and only their spectral amplitude can be
uniquely determined from output correlations, we show that in practice this
method provides excellent estimates of kernels from a range of parametric
models of neural systems. We conclude by discussing how this approach could
potentially enable neural models to be estimated from a much wider variety of
experimental conditions and systems, and its limitations.

phylogenetic trees, such networks canonically induce collections of
phylogenetic trees, clusters, and triplets, respectively. Thus it is not
surprising that many network approaches aim to reconstruct a phylogenetic
network from such collections. Related to the well-studied perfect phylogeny
problem, the following question is of fundamental importance in this context:
When does one of the above collections encode (i.e. uniquely describe) the
network that induces it? In this note, we present a complete answer to this
question for the special case of a level-1 (phylogenetic) network by
characterizing those level-1 networks for which an encoding in terms of one (or
equivalently all) of the above collections exists. Given that this type of
network forms the first layer of the rich hierarchy of level-k networks, k a
non-negative integer, it is natural to wonder whether our arguments could be
extended to members of that hierarchy for higher values for k. By giving
examples, we show that this is not the case.

activation. T cell activation requires sufficiently strong binding of T cell
receptors (TCRs) on their surface to short peptides (p) derived from foreign
proteins, which are bound to major histocompatibility (MHC) gene products
(displayed on antigen presenting cells). A diverse and self-tolerant T cell
repertoire is selected in the thymus. We map thymic selection processes to an
extreme value problem and provide an analytic expression for the amino acid
compositions of selected TCRs (which enable its recognition functions).

0907.3441	q-bio	q-bio.BM q-bio.QM	Analytical derivation of thermodynamic properties of bolalipid membrane	"  We consider a model of bilayer lipid membrane with bola-lipids. The
bola-lipid is modeled by linking tails of the hydrophobic chains in the
opposite monolayers within bilayer as a first approximation. A number of
thermodynamical characteristics are calculated analytically and compared with
the ones of a regular membrane without chains linkage. Pronounced difference
between lateral pressure profiles at the layers interface for linked and
regular bilayer models is found. In the linked case, the lateral pressure
mid-plane peak disappears, while the free energy per chain increases. We have
also calculated distribution of the orientaional order parameter of linked
chains across the bilayer, and found it is in contrast with the usual lipids
case.

0909.3691	q-bio	q-bio.GN	Compressed Genotyping	"  Significant volumes of knowledge have been accumulated in recent years
linking subtle genetic variations to a wide variety of medical disorders from
Cystic Fibrosis to mental retardation. Nevertheless, there are still great
challenges in applying this knowledge routinely in the clinic, largely due to
the relatively tedious and expensive process of DNA sequencing. Since the
genetic polymorphisms that underlie these disorders are relatively rare in the
human population, the presence or absence of a disease-linked polymorphism can
be thought of as a sparse signal. Using methods and ideas from compressed
sensing and group testing, we have developed a cost-effective genotyping
protocol. In particular, we have adapted our scheme to a recently developed
class of high throughput DNA sequencing technologies, and assembled a
mathematical framework that has some important distinctions from 'traditional'
compressed sensing ideas in order to address different biological and technical
constraints.

0909.4485	q-bio	q-bio.PE q-bio.QM	"A note on a paper by Erik Volz [arXiv:0705.2092]: SIR dynamics in random
  networks"	"  Recent work by Erik Volz [arXiv:0705.2092] has shown how to calculate the
growth and eventual decay of an SIR epidemic on a static random network,
assuming infection and recovery each happen at constant rates. This calculation
allows us to account for effects due to heterogeneity in degree that are
neglected in the standard mass-action SIR equations. In this note we offer an
alternate derivation which arrives at a simpler -- though equivalent -- system
of governing equations to that of Volz. This new derivation is more closely
connected to the underlying physical processes, and the resulting equations are
of comparable complexity to the mass-action SIR equations. We further show that
earlier derivations of the final size of epidemics on networks can be
reproduced using the same approach, thereby providing a common framework for
calculating both the dynamics and the final size of an epidemic spreading on a
random network.

subregion exposure time, temporal information is embedded within each stored

0910.0826	q-bio	physics.soc-ph cond-mat.stat-mech nlin.AO q-bio.PE	Coevolutionary games - a mini review	"  Prevalence of cooperation within groups of selfish individuals is puzzling in
that it contradicts with the basic premise of natural selection. Favoring
players with higher fitness, the latter is key for understanding the challenges
faced by cooperators when competing with defectors. Evolutionary game theory
provides a competent theoretical framework for addressing the subtleties of
cooperation in such situations, which are known as social dilemmas. Recent
advances point towards the fact that the evolution of strategies alone may be
insufficient to fully exploit the benefits offered by cooperative behavior.
Indeed, while spatial structure and heterogeneity, for example, have been
recognized as potent promoters of cooperation, coevolutionary rules can extend
the potentials of such entities further, and even more importantly, lead to the
understanding of their emergence. The introduction of coevolutionary rules to
evolutionary games implies, that besides the evolution of strategies, another
property may simultaneously be subject to evolution as well. Coevolutionary
rules may affect the interaction network, the reproduction capability of
players, their reputation, mobility or age. Here we review recent works on
evolutionary games incorporating coevolutionary rules, as well as give a
didactic description of potential pitfalls and misconceptions associated with
the subject. In addition, we briefly outline directions for future research
that we feel are promising, thereby particularly focusing on dynamical effects
of coevolutionary rules on the evolution of cooperation, which are still widely
open to research and thus hold promise of exciting new discoveries.

0910.2903	q-bio	q-bio.BM q-bio.GN	"Combining predictors of natively unfolded proteins to detect a twilight
  zone between order and disorder in generic datasets"	"  Natively unfolded proteins lack a well defined three dimensional structure
but have important biological functions, suggesting a re-assignment of the
structure-function paradigm. Many proteins have amino acidic compositions
compatible both with the folded and unfolded status, and belong to a twilight
zone between order and disorder. This makes difficult a dichotomic
classification of protein sequences into folded and natively unfolded ones. In
this methodological paper dichotomic folding indexes are considered:
hydrophobicity-charge, mean packing, mean pairwise energy, Poodle-W and a new
global index, that is called here gVSL2, based on the local disorder predictor
VSL2. The performance of these indexes is evaluated on different datasets.
Poodle-W, gVSL2 and mean pairwise energy have good performance and stability in
all the datasets considered and are combined into a strictly unanimous
combination score SSU, that leaves proteins unclassified when the consensus of
all combined indexes is not reached. The unclassified proteins: i) belong to an
overlap region in the vector space of amino acidic compositions occupied by
both folded and unfolded proteins; ii) are composed by approximately the same
number of order-promoting and disorder-promoting amino acids; iii) have a mean
flexibility intermediate between that of folded and that of unfolded proteins.
These proteins reasonably have physical properties intermediate between those
of folded and those of natively unfolded proteins and their structural
properties and evolutionary history are worth to be investigated.

classical Lotka-Volterra model characterized by a spatial scale which controls
the predator-prey interaction range. Analytical and simulational results show
that patterns can emerge in some regions of the parameters space where the
instability is driven by the range of the interaction. The individual-based
implementation captures realistic ecological features. In fact, spatial

predators' extinction.

0912.4760	q-bio	q-bio.NC physics.bio-ph q-bio.QM	From modes to movement in the behavior of C. elegans	"  Organisms move through the world by changing their shape, and here we explore
the mapping from shape space to movements in the nematode C. elegans as it
crawls on a planar agar surface. We characterize the statistics of the
trajectories through the correlation functions of the orientation angular
velocity, orientation angle and the mean-squared displacement, and we find that
the loss of orientational memory has significant contributions from both
abrupt, large amplitude turning events and the continuous dynamics between
these events. Further, we demonstrate long-time persistence of orientational
memory in the intervals between abrupt turns. Building on recent work
demonstrating that C. elegans movements are restricted to a low-dimensional
shape space, we construct a map from the dynamics in this shape space to the
trajectory of the worm along the agar. We use this connection to illustrate
that changes in the continuous dynamics reveal subtle differences in movement
strategy that occur among mutants defective in two classes of dopamine
receptors.

Our aim is to present a survey of bounds on the rate of DNA codes with respect

1001.5292	q-bio	q-bio.CB q-bio.MN	Modularity map of the network of human cell differentiation	"  Cell differentiation in multicellular organisms is a complex process whose
mechanism can be understood by a reductionist approach, in which the individual
processes that control the generation of different cell types are identified.
Alternatively, a large scale approach in search of different organizational
features of the growth stages promises to reveal its modular global structure
with the goal of discovering previously unknown relations between cell types.
Here we sort and analyze a large set of scattered data to construct the network
of human cell differentiation (NHCD) based on cell types (nodes) and
differentiation steps (links) from the fertilized egg to a crying baby. We
discover a dynamical law of critical branching, which reveals a fractal
regularity in the modular organization of the network, and allows us to observe
the network at different scales. The emerging picture clearly identifies
clusters of cell types following a hierarchical organization, ranging from
sub-modules to super-modules of specialized tissues and organs on varying
scales. This discovery will allow one to treat the development of a particular
cell function in the context of the complex network of human development as a
whole. Our results point to an integrated large-scale view of the network of
cell types systematically revealing ties between previously unrelated domains
in organ functions.

Studies on submerged fermentation revealed that maximum level of enzyme
production was during early stationary phase. Optimum pH, inoculum and
temperature were 9.0, 3 percent and 33 C respectively. Among carbon sources 0.3
peccent starch gave a maximum production followed by maltose, xylose and

casein followed by soybean meal, yeast extract and malt extract. Further, it
was optimized with 0.5 percent, 1.0 percentand 1.5 percent of NaCl among which
1 percent NaCl resulted in maximum level of protease. The protease profile of

a challenge to understanding the basis of genetic diseases. This is
particularly true for proteins related to diseases for which there are no
available three dimensional structures. One such disease is Shwachman Diamond
syndrome SDS OMIM 260400, a multi system disease arising from loss of
functional mutations. The Homo sapiens Shwachman Bodian Diamond Syndrome gene
hSBDS is responsible for SDS. hSBDS is expressed in all tissues and encodes a
protein of 250 amino acids SwissProt accession code Q9Y3A5. Sequence analysis
of disease associated alleles has identified more than 20 different mutations
in affected individuals. While a number of these mutations have been described
as leading to the loss of protein function due to truncation, translation or
surface epitope association, the structural basis for these mutations has yet
to be determined due to the lack of a three-dimensional structure for SBDS.

  Salt Bridges, Self-Energy, and Solvation"	"  Using a recently developed mesoscopic theory of protein dielectrics, we have
calculated the salt bridge energies, total residue electrostatic potential
energies, and transfer energies into a low dielectric amyloid-like phase for 12
species and mutants of the prion protein. Salt bridges and self energies play
key roles in stabilizing secondary and tertiary structural elements of the
prion protein. The total electrostatic potential energy of each residue was
found to be invariably stabilizing. Residues frequently found to be mutated in
familial prion disease were among those with the largest electrostatic
energies. The large barrier to charged group desolvation imposes regional
constraints on involvement of the prion protein in an amyloid aggregate,
resulting in an electrostatic amyloid recruitment profile that favours regions
of sequence between alpha helix 1 and beta strand 2, the middles of helices 2
and 3, and the region N-terminal to alpha helix 1. We found that the
stabilization due to salt bridges is minimal among the proteins studied for
disease-susceptible human mutants of prion protein.

1004.4250	q-bio	math.OC math.PR q-bio.PE	On Optimal Harvesting Problems in Random Environments	"  This paper investigates the optimal harvesting strategy for a single species
living in random environments whose growth is given by a regime-switching
diffusion. Harvesting acts as a (stochastic) control on the size of the
population. The objective is to find a harvesting strategy which maximizes the
expected total discounted income from harvesting {\em up to the time of
extinction} of the species; the income rate is allowed to be state- and
environment-dependent. This is a singular stochastic control problem with both
the extinction time and the optimal harvesting policy depending on the initial
condition. One aspect of receiving payments up to the random time of extinction
is that small changes in the initial population size may significantly alter
the extinction time when using the same harvesting policy. Consequently, one no
longer obtains continuity of the value function using standard arguments for
either regular or singular control problems having a fixed time horizon. This
paper introduces a new sufficient condition under which the continuity of the
value function for the regime-switching model is established. Further, it is
shown that the value function is a viscosity solution of a coupled system of
quasi-variational inequalities. The paper also establishes a verification
theorem and, based on this theorem, an $\varepsilon$-optimal harvesting
strategy is constructed under certain conditions on the model. Two examples are
analyzed in detail.

  Network"	"  Protein phosphorylation is a reversible post-translational modification
commonly used by cell signaling networks to transmit information about the
extracellular environment into intracellular organelles for the regulation of
the activity and sorting of proteins within the cell. For this study we
reconstructed a literature-based mammalian kinase-substrate network from
several online resources. The interactions within this directed graph network
connect kinases to their substrates, through specific phosphosites including
kinase-kinase regulatory interactions. However, the ""signs"" of links,
activation or inhibition of the substrate upon phosphorylation, within this
network are mostly unknown. Here we show how we can infer the ""signs""
indirectly using data from quantitative phosphoproteomics experiments applied
to mammalian cells combined with the literature-based kinase-substrate network.
Our inference method was able to predict the sign for 321 links and 153
phosphosites on 120 kinases, resulting in signed and directed subnetwork of
mammalian kinase-kinase interactions. Such an approach can rapidly advance the
reconstruction of cell signaling pathways and networks regulating mammalian
cells.

1005.2108	q-bio	q-bio.PE math.CO	CSD Homomorphisms Between Phylogenetic Networks	"  Since Darwin, species trees have been used as a simplified description of the
relationships which summarize the complicated network $N$ of reality. Recent
evidence of hybridization and lateral gene transfer, however, suggest that
there are situations where trees are inadequate. Consequently it is important
to determine properties that characterize networks closely related to $N$ and
possibly more complicated than trees but lacking the full complexity of $N$.
  A connected surjective digraph map (CSD) is a map $f$ from one network $N$ to
another network $M$ such that every arc is either collapsed to a single vertex
or is taken to an arc, such that $f$ is surjective, and such that the inverse
image of a vertex is always connected. CSD maps are shown to behave well under
composition. It is proved that if there is a CSD map from $N$ to $M$, then
there is a way to lift an undirected version of $M$ into $N$, often with added
resolution. A CSD map from $N$ to $M$ puts strong constraints on $N$.
  In general, it may be useful to study classes of networks such that, for any
$N$, there exists a CSD map from $N$ to some standard member of that class.

1010.0904	q-bio	q-bio.MN	"Novel statistical ensemble analysis for simulating extrinsic
  noise-driven response in NF-{\kappa}B signaling network"	"  Cellular responses in the single cells are known to be highly heterogeneous
and individualistic due to the strong influence by extrinsic and intrinsic
noise. Here, we are concerned about how to model the extrinsic noise-induced
heterogeneous response in the single cells under the constraints of
experimentally obtained population-averaged response, but without much detailed
kinetic information. We propose a novel statistical ensemble scheme where
extrinsic noise is regarded as fluctuations in the values of kinetic parameters
and such fluctuations are modeled by randomly sampling the kinetic rate
constants from a uniform distribution. We consider a large number of signaling
system replicates, each of which has the same network topology, but a uniquely
different set of kinetic rate constants. A protein dynamic response from each
replicate should represent the dynamics in a single cell and the statistical
ensemble average should be regarded as a population-level response averaged
over a population of the cells. We devise an optimization algorithm to find the
correct uniform distribution of the network parameters, which produces the
correct statistical distribution of the response whose ensemble average and
distribution agree well with the population-level experimental data and the
experimentally observed heterogeneity. We apply this statistical ensemble
analysis to a NF-{\kappa}B signaling system and (1) predict the distributions
of the heterogeneous NF-{\kappa}B (either oscillatory or non-oscillatory)
dynamic patterns and of the dynamic features (e.g., period), (2) predict that
both the distribution and the statistical ensemble average of the NF-{\kappa}B
dynamic response depends sensitively on the dosage of stimulant, and lastly (3)
demonstrate the sigmoidally shaped dose-response from the statistical ensemble
average and the individual replicates.

reactions which synthesize biomass molecules from chemicals in an organism's
environment. The metabolic network of any one organism is encoded by a
metabolic genotype, defined by a set of enzyme-coding genes whose products
catalyze the network's reactions. Each metabolic genotype has a metabolic
phenotype, such as the ability to synthesize biomass on a spectrum of different
sources of chemical elements and energy. We here focus on sulfur metabolism,
which is attractive to study the evolution of metabolic networks, because it
involves many fewer reactions than carbon metabolism. Specifically, we study
properties of the space of all possible metabolic genotypes, and analyze
properties of random metabolic genotypes that are viable on different numbers
of sulfur sources. We show that metabolic genotypes with the same phenotype
form large connected genotype networks that extend far through metabolic
genotype space. How far they reach through this space is a linear function of
the number of super-essential reactions in such networks, the number of
reactions that occur in all networks with the same phenotype. We show that
different neighborhoods of any genotype network harbor very different novel
phenotypes, metabolic innovations that can sustain life on novel sulfur
sources. We also analyze the ability of evolving populations of metabolic
networks to explore novel metabolic phenotypes. This ability is facilitated by
the existence of genotype networks, because different neighborhoods of these
networks contain very different novel phenotypes. In contrast to
macromolecules, where phenotypic robustness may facilitate phenotypic
innovation, we show that here the ability to access novel phenotypes does not
monotonically increase with robustness.

1010.1409	q-bio	q-bio.MN stat.AP	"A sparse regulatory network of copy-number driven expression reveals
  putative breast cancer oncogenes"	"  The influence of DNA cis-regulatory elements on a gene's expression has been
intensively studied. However, little is known about expressions driven by
trans-acting DNA hotspots. DNA hotspots harboring copy number aberrations are
recognized to be important in cancer as they influence multiple genes on a
global scale. The challenge in detecting trans-effects is mainly due to the
computational difficulty in detecting weak and sparse trans-acting signals
amidst co-occuring passenger events. We propose an integrative approach to
learn a sparse interaction network of DNA copy-number regions with their
downstream targets in a breast cancer dataset. Information from this network
helps distinguish copy-number driven from copy-number independent expression
changes on a global scale. Our result further delineates cis- and trans-effects
in a breast cancer dataset, for which important oncogenes such as ESR1 and
ERBB2 appear to be highly copy-number dependent. Further, our model is shown to
be efficient and in terms of goodness of fit no worse than other state-of the
art predictors and network reconstruction models using both simulated and real
data.

  patterns over somatic cell divisions in mammals"	"  We develop Bayesian inference methods for a recently-emerging type of
epigenetic data to study the transmission fidelity of DNA methylation patterns
over cell divisions. The data consist of parent-daughter double-stranded DNA
methylation patterns with each pattern coming from a single cell and
represented as an unordered pair of binary strings. The data are technically
difficult and time-consuming to collect, putting a premium on an efficient
inference method. Our aim is to estimate rates for the maintenance and de novo
methylation events that gave rise to the observed patterns, while accounting
for measurement error. We model data at multiple sites jointly, thus using
whole-strand information, and considerably reduce confounding between
parameters. We also adopt a hierarchical structure that allows for variation in
rates across sites without an explosion in the effective number of parameters.
Our context-specific priors capture the expected stationarity, or
near-stationarity, of the stochastic process that generated the data analyzed
here. This expected stationarity is shown to greatly increase the precision of
the estimation. Applying our model to a data set collected at the human FMR1
locus, we find that measurement errors, generally ignored in similar studies,
occur at a nontrivial rate (inappropriate bisulfite conversion error: 1.6$%$
with 80$%$ CI: 0.9--2.3$%$). Accounting for these errors has a substantial
impact on estimates of key biological parameters. The estimated average failure
of maintenance rate and daughter de novo rate decline from 0.04 to 0.024 and
from 0.14 to 0.07, respectively, when errors are accounted for. Our results
also provide evidence that de novo events may occur on both parent and daughter
strands: the median parent and daughter de novo rates are 0.08 (80$%$ CI:
0.04--0.13) and 0.07 (80$%$ CI: 0.04--0.11), respectively.

  behavior"	"  What fascinates us about animal behavior is its richness and complexity, but
understanding behavior and its neural basis requires a simpler description.
Traditionally, simplification has been imposed by training animals to engage in
a limited set of behaviors, by hand scoring behaviors into discrete classes, or
by limiting the sensory experience of the organism. An alternative is to ask
whether we can search through the dynamics of natural behaviors to find
explicit evidence that these behaviors are simpler than they might have been.
We review two mathematical approaches to simplification, dimensionality
reduction and the maximum entropy method, and we draw on examples from
different levels of biological organization, from the crawling behavior of C.
elegans to the control of smooth pursuit eye movements in primates, and from
the coding of natural scenes by networks of neurons in the retina to the rules
of English spelling. In each case, we argue that the explicit search for
simplicity uncovers new and unexpected features of the biological system, and
that the evidence for simplification gives us a language with which to phrase
new questions for the next generation of experiments. The fact that similar
mathematical structures succeed in taming the complexity of very different
biological systems hints that there is something more general to be discovered.

1101.5919	q-bio	stat.ML q-bio.GN	Dependency detection with similarity constraints	"  Unsupervised two-view learning, or detection of dependencies between two
paired data sets, is typically done by some variant of canonical correlation
analysis (CCA). CCA searches for a linear projection for each view, such that
the correlations between the projections are maximized. The solution is
invariant to any linear transformation of either or both of the views; for
tasks with small sample size such flexibility implies overfitting, which is
even worse for more flexible nonparametric or kernel-based dependency discovery
methods. We develop variants which reduce the degrees of freedom by assuming

example is provided by a cancer gene discovery application where chromosomal
distance affects the dependencies between gene copy number and activity levels.

1102.3596	q-bio	q-bio.OT	The genetic code, 8-dimensional hypercomplex numbers and dyadic shifts	"  Matrix forms of the representation of the multi-level system of
molecular-genetic alphabets have revealed algebraic properties of this system.
Families of genetic (4*4)- and (8*8)-matrices show unexpected connections of
the genetic system with Walsh functions and Hadamard matrices, which are known
in theory of noise-immunity coding, digital communication and digital
holography. Dyadic-shift decompositions of such genetic matrices lead to sets
of sparse matrices. Each of these sets is closed in relation to multiplication
and defines relevant algebra of hypercomplex numbers. It is shown that genetic
Hadamard matrices are identical to matrix representations of Hamilton
quaternions and its complexification in the case of unit coordinates. The
diversity of known dialects of the genetic code is analyzed from the viewpoint
of the genetic algebras. An algebraic analogy with Punnett squares for
inherited traits is shown. Our results are used in analyzing genetic phenomena.
The statement about existence of the geno-logic code in DNA and epigenetics on
the base of the spectral logic of systems of Boolean functions is put forward.
Our results show promising ways to develop algebraic-logical biology, in
particular, in connection with the logic holography on Walsh functions.

1104.4092	q-bio	q-bio.CB physics.bio-ph q-bio.SC	"Noise Filtering Strategies of Adaptive Signaling Networks: The Case of
  E. Coli Chemotaxis"	"  Two distinct mechanisms for filtering noise in an input signal are identified
in a class of adaptive sensory networks. We find that the high frequency noise
is filtered by the output degradation process through time-averaging; while the
low frequency noise is damped by adaptation through negative feedback. Both
filtering processes themselves introduce intrinsic noises, which are found to
be unfiltered and can thus amount to a significant internal noise floor even
without signaling. These results are applied to E. coli chemotaxis. We show
unambiguously that the molecular mechanism for the Berg-Purcell time-averaging
scheme is the dephosphorylation of the response regulator CheY-P, not the
receptor adaptation process as previously suggested. The high frequency noise
due to the stochastic ligand binding-unbinding events and the random ligand
molecule diffusion is averaged by the CheY-P dephosphorylation process to a
negligible level in E.coli. We identify a previously unstudied noise source
caused by the random motion of the cell in a ligand gradient. We show that this
random walk induced signal noise has a divergent low frequency component, which
is only rendered finite by the receptor adaptation process. For gradients
within the E. coli sensing range, this dominant external noise can be
comparable to the significant intrinsic noise in the system. The dependence of
the response and its fluctuations on the key time scales of the system are
studied systematically. We show that the chemotaxis pathway may have evolved to
optimize gradient sensing, strong response, and noise control in different time
scales

1106.0887	q-bio	physics.soc-ph nlin.AO q-bio.PE	Urban chaos and replacement dynamics in nature and society	"  Many growing phenomena in both nature and society can be predicted with
sigmoid function. The growth curve of the level of urbanization is a typical
S-shaped one, and can be described by using logistic function. The logistic
model implies a replacement process, and the logistic substitution suggests
non-linear dynamical behaviors such as bifurcation and chaos. Using
mathematical transform and numerical computation, we can demonstrate that the
1-dimensional map comes from a 2-dimensional two-group interaction map. By
analogy with urbanization, a general theory of replacement dynamics is
presented in this paper, and the replacement process can be simulated with the
2-dimansional map. If the rate of replacement is too high, periodic
oscillations and chaos will arise, and the system maybe breaks down. The
replacement theory can be used to interpret various complex interaction and
conversion in physical and human systems. The replacement dynamics provides a
new way of looking at Volterra-Lotka's predator-prey interaction, man-land
relation, and dynastic changes resulting from peasant uprising, and so on.

1106.2773	q-bio	math.OC cs.SY q-bio.PE	"On Optimal Harvesting in Stochastic Environments: Optimal Policies in a
  Relaxed Model"	"  This paper examines the objective of optimally harvesting a single species in
a stochastic environment. This problem has previously been analyzed in Alvarez
(2000) using dynamic programming techniques and, due to the natural payoff
structure of the price rate function (the price decreases as the population
increases), no optimal harvesting policy exists. This paper establishes a
relaxed formulation of the harvesting model in such a manner that existence of
an optimal relaxed harvesting policy can not only be proven but also
identified. The analysis embeds the harvesting problem in an
infinite-dimensional linear program over a space of occupation measures in
which the initial position enters as a parameter and then analyzes an auxiliary
problem having fewer constraints. In this manner upper bounds are determined
for the optimal value (with the given initial position); these bounds depend on
the relation of the initial population size to a specific target size. The more
interesting case occurs when the initial population exceeds this target size; a
new argument is required to obtain a sharp upper bound. Though the initial
population size only enters as a parameter, the value is determined in a
closed-form functional expression of this parameter.

  subsamples?"	"  Sparse coding or sparse dictionary learning has been widely used to recover
underlying structure in many kinds of natural data. Here, we provide conditions
guaranteeing when this recovery is universal; that is, when sparse codes and
dictionaries are unique (up to natural symmetries). Our main tool is a useful
lemma in combinatorial matrix theory that allows us to derive bounds on the
sample sizes guaranteeing such uniqueness under various assumptions for how
training data are generated. Whenever the conditions to one of our theorems are
met, any sparsity-constrained learning algorithm that succeeds in
reconstructing the data recovers the original sparse codes and dictionary. We
also discuss potential applications to neuroscience and data analysis.

1108.0530	q-bio	physics.bio-ph cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.CB	"The influence of T cell development on pathogen specificity and
  autoreactivity"	"  T cells orchestrate adaptive immune responses upon activation. T cell
activation requires sufficiently strong binding of T cell receptors on their
surface to short peptides derived from foreign proteins bound to protein
products of the major histocompatibility (MHC) gene products, which are
displayed on the surface of antigen presenting cells. T cells can also interact
with peptide-MHC complexes, where the peptide is derived from host (self)
proteins. A diverse repertoire of relatively self-tolerant T cell receptors is
selected in the thymus. We study a model, computationally and analytically, to
describe how thymic selection shapes the repertoire of T cell receptors, such
that T cell receptor recognition of pathogenic peptides is both specific and
degenerate. We also discuss the escape probability of autoimmune T cells from
the thymus.

1108.2414	q-bio	math.PR q-bio.NC	Propagation of chaos in neural fields	"  We consider the problem of the limit of bio-inspired spatially extended
neuronal networks including an infinite number of neuronal types (space
locations), with space-dependent propagation delays modeling neural fields. The
propagation of chaos property is proved in this setting under mild assumptions
on the neuronal dynamics, valid for most models used in neuroscience, in a
mesoscopic limit, the neural-field limit, in which we can resolve the quite
fine structure of the neuron's activity in space and where averaging effects
occur. The mean-field equations obtained are of a new type: they take the form
of well-posed infinite-dimensional delayed integro-differential equations with
a nonlocal mean-field term and a singular spatio-temporal Brownian motion. We
also show how these intricate equations can be used in practice to uncover
mathematically the precise mesoscopic dynamics of the neural field in a
particular model where the mean-field equations exactly reduce to deterministic
nonlinear delayed integro-differential equations. These results have several
theoretical implications in neuroscience we review in the discussion.

1108.4790	q-bio	q-bio.CB nlin.AO	Structure of Cell Networks Critically Determines Oscillation Regularity	"  Biological rhythms are generated by pacemaker organs, such as the heart
pacemaker organ (the sinoatrial node) and the master clock of the circadian
rhythms (the suprachiasmatic nucleus), which are composed of a network of
autonomously oscillatory cells. Such biological rhythms have notable
periodicity despite the internal and external noise present in each cell.
Previous experimental studies indicate that the regularity of oscillatory
dynamics is enhanced when noisy oscillators interact and become synchronized.
This effect, called the collective enhancement of temporal precision, has been
studied theoretically using particular assumptions. In this study, we propose a
general theoretical framework that enables us to understand the dependence of
temporal precision on network parameters including size, connectivity, and
coupling intensity; this effect has been poorly understood to date. Our
framework is based on a phase oscillator model that is applicable to general
oscillator networks with any coupling mechanism if coupling and noise are
sufficiently weak. In particular, we can manage general directed and weighted
networks. We quantify the precision of the activity of a single cell and the
mean activity of an arbitrary subset of cells. We find that, in general
undirected networks, the standard deviation of cycle-to-cycle periods scales
with the system size $N$ as $1/\sqrt{N}$, but only up to a certain system size
$N^*$ that depends on network parameters. Enhancement of temporal precision is
ineffective when $N>N^*$. We also reveal the advantage of long-range
interactions among cells to temporal precision.

reaction-diffusion equation coupled with subsystem of ordinary differential
equations, describing spatially-distributed growth of clonal populations of
precancerous cells, whose proliferation is controled by growth factors
diffusing in the extracellular medium and binding to the cell surface. We
extend the results on the existence of nonhomogenous stationary solutions
obtained in the previous work of one of the authors to a general Hill-type
production function and full parameter set. Using spectral analysis and
perturbation theory we derive conditions for the linearized stability of such

jointly distributed random variables, which satisfy the triangle inequality and
vanish at identical arguments (pseudo-quasi-metrics). These functions are
useful in dealing with the problem of selective probabilistic causality
encountered in behavioral sciences and in quantum physics. The problem reduces
to that of ascertaining the existence of a joint distribution for a set of
variables with known distributions of certain subsets of this set. Any
violation of the triangle inequality or its consequences by one of our
functions when applied to such a set rules out the existence of this joint
distribution. We focus on an especially versatile and widely applicable
pseudo-quasi-metric called an order-distance and its special case called a
classification distance.

  and sparsely sampled time-series"	"  A method to estimate the time-dependent correlation via an empirical bias
estimate of the time-delayed mutual information for a time-series is proposed.
In particular, the bias of the time-delayed mutual information is shown to
often be equivalent to the mutual information between two distributions of
points from the same system separated by infinite time. Thus intuitively,
estimation of the bias is reduced to estimation of the mutual information
between distributions of data points separated by large time intervals. The
proposed bias estimation techniques are shown to work for Lorenz equations data
and glucose time series data of three patients from the Columbia University
Medical Center database.

1110.4294	q-bio	q-bio.NC math.PR	"Mean Field description of and propagation of chaos in recurrent
  multipopulation networks of Hodgkin-Huxley and Fitzhugh-Nagumo neurons"	"  We derive the mean-field equations arising as the limit of a network of
interacting spiking neurons, as the number of neurons goes to infinity. The
neurons belong to a fixed number of populations and are represented either by
the Hodgkin-Huxley model or by one of its simplified version, the
Fitzhugh-Nagumo model. The synapses between neurons are either electrical or
chemical. The network is assumed to be fully connected. The maximum
conductances vary randomly. Under the condition that all neurons initial
conditions are drawn independently from the same law that depends only on the
population they belong to, we prove that a propagation of chaos phenomenon
takes places, namely that in the mean-field limit, any finite number of neurons
become independent and, within each population, have the same probability
distribution. This probability distribution is solution of a set of implicit
equations, either nonlinear stochastic differential equations resembling the
McKean-Vlasov equations, or non-local partial differential equations resembling
the McKean-Vlasov-Fokker- Planck equations. We prove the well-posedness of
these equations, i.e. the existence and uniqueness of a solution. We also show
the results of some preliminary numerical experiments that indicate that the
mean-field equations are a good representation of the mean activity of a finite
size network, even for modest sizes. These experiment also indicate that the
McKean-Vlasov-Fokker- Planck equations may be a good way to understand the
mean-field dynamics through, e.g., a bifurcation analysis.

microtubules. The proposed 4 -block model, which can be seen as a
coarse-grained approximation of the full polymorphic tube model, permits a
complete analytical treatment of all thermodynamic properties including
correlation functions and angular fourier mode distributions. Due to its
mathematical tractability the model straightforwardly leads to some physical
insights in recently discussed phenomena like the ""length dependent persistence

worm like chain on small and on large scales and yet display distinct anomalous
tell-tale features indicating an inner switching dynamics on intermediate
length scales.

heterogeneous population dynamics. The algorithm combines an exact method to
simulate molecular-level fluctuations in single cells and a constant-number
Monte Carlo method to simulate time-dependent statistical characteristics of
growing cell populations. To benchmark performance, we compare simulation
results with steadystate and time-dependent analytical solutions for several
scenarios, including steadystate and time-dependent gene expression, and the
effects on population heterogeneity of cell growth, division, and DNA
replication. This comparison demonstrates that the algorithm provides an
efficient and accurate approach to simulate how complex biological features
influence gene expression. We also use the algorithm to model gene expression
dynamics within ""bet-hedging"" cell populations during their adaption to
environmental stress. These simulations indicate that the algorithm provides a
framework suitable for simulating and analyzing realistic models of
heterogeneous population dynamics combining molecular-level stochastic reaction
kinetics, relevant physiological details and phenotypic variability.

1112.0270	q-bio	q-bio.MN math.DS math.OC q-bio.QM	"Linear models of activation cascades: analytical solutions and
  coarse-graining of delayed signal transduction"	"  Cellular signal transduction usually involves activation cascades, the
sequential activation of a series of proteins following the reception of an
input signal. Here we study the classic model of weakly activated cascades and
obtain analytical solutions for a variety of inputs. We show that in the
special but important case of optimal-gain cascades (i.e., when the
deactivation rates are identical) the downstream output of the cascade can be
represented exactly as a lumped nonlinear module containing an incomplete gamma
function with real parameters that depend on the rates and length of the
cascade, as well as parameters of the input signal. The expressions obtained
can be applied to the non-identical case when the deactivation rates are random
to capture the variability in the cascade outputs. We also show that cascades
can be rearranged so that blocks with similar rates can be lumped and
represented through our nonlinear modules. Our results can be used both to
represent cascades in computational models of differential equations and to fit
data efficiently, by reducing the number of equations and parameters involved.
In particular, the length of the cascade appears as a real-valued parameter and
can thus be fitted in the same manner as Hill coefficients. Finally, we show
how the obtained nonlinear modules can be used instead of delay differential
equations to model delays in signal transduction.

1201.0321	q-bio	q-bio.NC cond-mat.dis-nn physics.bio-ph	"Maximally informative ""stimulus energies"" in the analysis of neural
  responses to natural signals"	"  The concept of feature selectivity in sensory signal processing can be
formalized as dimensionality reduction: in a stimulus space of very high
dimensions, neurons respond only to variations within some smaller, relevant
subspace. But if neural responses exhibit invariances, then the relevant
subspace typically cannot be reached by a Euclidean projection of the original
stimulus. We argue that, in several cases, we can make progress by appealing to
the simplest nonlinear construction, identifying the relevant variables as
quadratic forms, or ""stimulus energies."" Natural examples include
non-phase-locked cells in the auditory system, complex cells in visual cortex,
and motion-sensitive neurons in the visual system. Generalizing the idea of
maximally informative dimensions, we show that one can search for the kernels
of the relevant quadratic forms by maximizing the mutual information between
the stimulus energy and the arrival times of action potentials. Simple
implementations of this idea successfully recover the underlying properties of
model neurons even when the number of parameters in the kernel is comparable to
the number of action potentials and stimuli are completely natural. We explore
several generalizations that allow us to incorporate plausible structure into
the kernel and thereby restrict the number of parameters. We hope that this
approach will add significantly to the set of tools available for the analysis
of neural responses to complex, naturalistic stimuli.

resonance condition is easier to be fulfilled in multiple pathways than that in

amount of neutral particles is ejected. A temporal study of the ablation plume
is carried out by recording neutral particle time-of- flight mass spectra as a
function of delay time between the ablation and post-ionization pulse. Close
the ablation threshold, the mechanism of ejection is found to be of
predominantely mechanical nature, driven by the relaxation of the laser-induced

broad velocity distributions and extremely low velocities.

analytical approach for treatment of non-linear shift in time occurring in
HPLC-MS data. Need of such tool in recent large dataset produced by analytical
chemistry and so-called omics studies is evident. Proposed approach is based on
measurement and comparison of blank and analyzed sample evident features. In
the first step of BBTA procedure, the number of compounds is reduced by
max-to-mean ratio thresholding, which extensively reduce the computational
time. Simple thresholding is followed by selection of time markers defined from
blank inflex points which are then used for the transformation function,
polynomial of second degree, in the example. BBTA approach was compared on real
HPLC-MS measurement with Correlation Optimized Warping (COW) method. It was
proved to have distinctively shorter computational time as well as lower level
of mathematical presumptions. The BBTA is computationally much easier, quicker
(more then 1000x) and accurate in comparison with warping. Moreover, markers
selection works efficiently without any peak detection. It is sufficient to
analyze only baseline contribution in the analyte measurement with sparse
knowledge of blank behavior. Finally, BBTA does not required usage of extra
internal standards and due to its simplicity it has a potential to be
widespread tool in HPLC-MS data treatment.

occur between groups of nodes when looking at the small scale of interactions
taking place in complex networks. Such findings claim for a new systematic
methodology to quantify, at node level, how a dynamics is being influenced (or
differentiated) by the structure of the underlying system. Here we define a new
measure that, based on dynamical characteristics obtained for a large set of
initial conditions, compares the dynamical behavior of the nodes present in the
system. Through this measure we find that the geographic and Barab\'asi-Albert
models have high capacity for generating networks that exhibit groups of nodes
with distinct dynamics compared to the rest of the network. The application of
our methodology is illustrated with respect of two real systems. In the first
we use the neuronal network of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to show that
the interneurons of the ventral cord of the nematode presents a very large
dynamical differentiation when compared to the rest of the network. The second
application concerns the SIS epidemic model on an airport network, where we

biological processes. However, so far, the mechanism of this translocation is
not fully understood. Recent studies show that helicase might translocate
through two processes, active process and passive process, with different
translocation rate. In this study, a model including such two processes is
presented. In which, each of these two processes consists of two sub-processes,
chemical sub-process in which needed translocation factors are attached, and
mechanochemical sub-process in which helicase makes a forward translocation
step. Helicase can switch stochastically between these two processes with
external force dependent rates. By this model, ribosome translocation along
message RNA is detailed discussed. We found that, with the increase of external
force, the mean translocation rate of ribosome increases from one lower limit
to one upper limit, and both of these two limits increase with concentrations
of the translocation factors. Under high external force, ribosome translocates
mainly through active process. At saturating concentrations of translocation
factors, the translocation is governed by mechanochemical sub-processes.

This is motivated by the fact that early diagnosis, classification and
detection of diseases such as cancer play a crucial role in their successful
treatment. The proposed nano-abnormality detection scheme (NADS) comprises of a
two-tier network of sensor nano-machines (SNMs) in the first tier and a data
gathering node (DGN) at the sink. The SNMs detect the presence of competitor
cells as abnormality that is captured by variations in parameters of a
nano-communications channel. In the second step, the SNMs transmit micro-scale
messages over a noisy micro communications channel (MCC) to the DGN, where a
decision is made upon fusing the received signals. The detection performance of
each SNM is analyzed by setting up a Neyman-Pearson test. Next, taking into
account the effect of the MCC, the overall performance of the proposed NADS is
quantified in terms of probabilities of misdetection and false alarm. A design
problem is formulated, when the optimized concentration of SNMs in a sample is
obtained for a high probability of detection and a limited probability of false
alarm.

size k subsets of X to the real numbers. Such maps naturally arise from
edge-weighted trees T with leaf-set X: Given a subset Y of X of size k, D(Y) is
defined to be the total length of the smallest subtree of T with leaf-set Y .
In case k = 2, it is well-known that 2-dissimilarities arising in this way can
be characterized by the so-called ""4-point condition"". However, in case k > 2
Pachter and Speyer recently posed the following question: Given an arbitrary
k-dissimilarity, how do we test whether this map comes from a tree? In this
paper, we provide an answer to this question, showing that for k >= 3 a
k-dissimilarity on a set X arises from a tree if and only if its restriction to
every 2k-element subset of X arises from some tree, and that 2k is the least
possible subset size to ensure that this is the case. As a corollary, we show
that there exists a polynomial-time algorithm to determine when a
k-dissimilarity arises from a tree. We also give a 6-point condition for
determining when a 3-dissimilarity arises from a tree, that is similar to the
aforementioned 4-point condition.

  sequences to RNA families"	"  Emerging high-throughput technologies have led to a deluge of putative
non-coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences identified in a wide variety of organisms.
Systematic characterization of these transcripts will be a tremendous
challenge. Homology detection is critical to making maximal use of functional
information gathered about ncRNAs: identifying homologous sequence allows us to
transfer information gathered in one organism to another quickly and with a
high degree of confidence. ncRNA presents a challenge for homology detection,
as the primary sequence is often poorly conserved and de novo secondary

  measure"	"  Feature extraction is an unavoidable task, especially in the critical step of
preprocessing biological sequences. This step consists for example in
transforming the biological sequences into vectors of motifs where each motif
is a subsequence that can be seen as a property (or attribute) characterizing
the sequence. Hence, we obtain an object-property table where objects are
sequences and properties are motifs extracted from sequences. This output can
be used to apply standard machine learning tools to perform data mining tasks
such as classification. Several previous works have described feature
extraction methods for bio-sequence classification, but none of them discussed
the robustness of these methods when perturbing the input data. In this work,
we introduce the notion of stability of the generated motifs in order to study
the robustness of motif extraction methods. We express this robustness in terms
of the ability of the method to reveal any change occurring in the input data
and also its ability to target the interesting motifs. We use these criteria to
evaluate and experimentally compare four existing extraction methods for
biological sequences.

  influences on molecular processes"	"  Recent calculations further supports the premise that large-scale synchronous
firings of neurons may affect molecular processes. The context is scalp
electroencephalography (EEG) during short-term memory (STM) tasks. The
mechanism considered is $\mathbf{\Pi} = \mathbf{p} + q \mathbf{A}$ (SI units)
coupling, where $\mathbf{p}$ is the momenta of free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ waves
$q$ the charge of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in units of the electron charge, and
$\mathbf{A}$ the magnetic vector potential of current $\mathbf{I}$ from
neuronal minicolumnar firings considered as wires, giving rise to EEG. Data has
processed using multiple graphs to identify sections of data to which
spline-Laplacian transformations are applied, to fit the statistical mechanics
of neocortical interactions (SMNI) model to EEG data, sensitive to synaptic
interactions subject to modification by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ waves.

  the Wright-Fisher model"	"  We pursue the task of developing a finite population counterpart to Eigen's
model. We consider the classical Wright-Fisher model describing the evolution
of a population of size $m$ of chromosomes of length $\ell$ over an alphabet of
cardinality $\kappa$. The mutation probability per locus is $q$. The
replication rate is $\sigma>1$ for the master sequence and $1$ for the other
sequences. We study the equilibrium distribution of the process in the regime
where $\ell\to+\infty$, $m\to+\infty$, $q\to0$, $\ell q\to a\in\,]0,+\infty[$,
$\frac{m}{\ell}\to\alpha\in [0,+\infty]$. We obtain an equation
$\alpha\psi(a)=\ln\kappa$ in the parameter space $(a,\alpha)$ separating the
regime where the equilibrium population is totally random from the regime where
a quasispecies is formed. We observe the existence of a critical population
size necessary for a quasispecies to emerge, and we recover the finite
population counterpart of the error threshold. The result is the twin brother
of the corresponding result for the Moran model. The proof is more complex, and
it relies on the Freidlin-Wentzell theory of random perturbations of dynamical
systems.

1207.3137	q-bio	q-bio.MN stat.AP	"Learning a nonlinear dynamical system model of gene regulation: A
  perturbed steady-state approach"	"  Biological structure and function depend on complex regulatory interactions
between many genes. A wealth of gene expression data is available from
high-throughput genome-wide measurement technologies, but effective gene
regulatory network inference methods are still needed. Model-based methods
founded on quantitative descriptions of gene regulation are among the most
promising, but many such methods rely on simple, local models or on ad hoc
inference approaches lacking experimental interpretability. We propose an
experimental design and develop an associated statistical method for inferring
a gene network by learning a standard quantitative, interpretable, predictive,
biophysics-based ordinary differential equation model of gene regulation. We
fit the model parameters using gene expression measurements from perturbed
steady-states of the system, like those following overexpression or knockdown
experiments. Although the original model is nonlinear, our design allows us to
transform it into a convex optimization problem by restricting attention to
steady-states and using the lasso for parameter selection. Here, we describe
the model and inference algorithm and apply them to a synthetic six-gene
system, demonstrating that the model is detailed and flexible enough to account
for activation and repression as well as synergistic and self-regulation, and
the algorithm can efficiently and accurately recover the parameters used to
generate the data.

1207.4085	q-bio	stat.ME q-bio.NC stat.AP stat.CO	"A Point-process Response Model for Spike Trains from Single Neurons in
  Neural Circuits under Optogenetic Stimulation"	"  Optogenetics is a new tool to study neuronal circuits that have been
genetically modified to allow stimulation by flashes of light. We study
recordings from single neurons within neural circuits under optogenetic
stimulation. The data from these experiments present a statistical challenge of
modeling a high frequency point process (neuronal spikes) while the input is
another high frequency point process (light flashes). We further develop a
generalized linear model approach to model the relationships between two point
processes, employing additive point-process response functions. The resulting
model, Point-process Responses for Optogenetics (PRO), provides explicit
nonlinear transformations to link the input point process with the output one.
Such response functions may provide important and interpretable scientific
insights into the properties of the biophysical process that governs neural
spiking in response to optogenetic stimulation. We validate and compare the PRO
model using a real dataset and simulations, and our model yields a superior
area-under-the- curve value as high as 93% for predicting every future spike.
For our experiment on the recurrent layer V circuit in the prefrontal cortex,
the PRO model provides evidence that neurons integrate their inputs in a
sophisticated manner. Another use of the model is that it enables understanding
how neural circuits are altered under various disease conditions and/or
experimental conditions by comparing the PRO parameters.

set of M identical quanta traveling independently from a source to a target.
The quanta are immediately captured upon arrival, first-passage times are
assumed independent and identically distributed and the quantum emission times
are constrained by a deadline. The primary application area is intended to be
inter/intracellular molecular signaling in biological systems whereby an
organelle, cell or group of cells must deliver some message (such as

certainty to another organelles, cells or group of cells. However, the model
can also be applied to communications systems wherein indistinguishable signals
have random transit latencies.

  Coefficient"	"  Constructing gene interaction networks (GINs) from high-throughput gene
expression data is an important and challenging problem in systems biology.
Existing algorithms produce networks that either have undirected and unweighted
edges, or else are constrained to contain no cycles, both of which are
biologically unrealistic. In the present paper we propose a new algorithm,
based on a concept from probability theory known as the phi-mixing coefficient,
that produces networks whose edges are weighted and directed, and are permitted
to contain cycles. Because there is no ""ground truth"" for genome-wide networks
on a human scale, we analyzed the outcomes of several experiments on lung
cancer, and matched the predictions from the inferred networks with
experimental results. Specifically, we inferred three networks (NSCLC,
Neuro-endocrine NSCLC plus SCLC, and normal) from the gene expression
measurements of 157 lung cancer and 59 normal cell lines, compared with the
outcomes of siRNA screening of 19,000+ genes on 11 NSCLC cell lines, and
analyzed data from a ChIP-Seq experiment to determine putative downstream
targets of the lineage specific oncogenic transcription factor ASCL1. The
inferred networks displayed a scale-free or power law behavior between the
degree of a node and the number of nodes with that degree. There was a strong
correlation between the degree of a gene in the inferred NSCLC network and its
essentiality for the survival of the cells. The inferred downstream
neighborhood genes of ASCL1 in the SCLC network were significantly enriched by
ChIP-Seq determined putative target genes, while no such enrichment was found
in the inferred NSCLC network.

  Inherent Time Scales"	"  From a coarse-grained perspective the motif of a self-activating species,
activating a second species which acts as its own repressor, is widely found in
biological systems, in particular in genetic systems with inherent oscillatory
behavior. Here we consider a specific realization of this motif as a genetic
circuit, in which genes are described as directly producing proteins, leaving
out the intermediate step of mRNA production. We focus on the effect that
inherent time scales on the underlying fine-grained scale can have on the
bifurcation patterns on a coarser scale in time. Time scales are set by the
binding and unbinding rates of the transcription factors to the promoter
regions of the genes. Depending on the ratio of these rates to the decay times
of the proteins, the appropriate averaging procedure for obtaining a
coarse-grained description changes and leads to sets of deterministic
equations, which differ in their bifurcation structure. In particular the
desired intermediate range of regular limit cycles fades away when the binding
rates of genes are of the same order or less than the decay time of at least
one of the proteins. Our analysis illustrates that the common topology of the
widely found motif alone does not necessarily imply universal features in the
dynamics.

includes spatial chemotaxis and diffusion across a two dimensional surface
representing the vaginal or rectal epithelium at primary HIV infection. A
linear stability analysis of the steady state solutions identified conditions
for Turing instability pattern formation. We have solved the model equations
numerically using parameter values obtained from previous experimental results
for HIV infections. Simulations of the model for this surface show hot spots of
infection. Understanding this localization is an important step in the ability
to correctly model early HIV infection. These spatial variations also have
implications for the development and effectiveness of microbicides against HIV.

adequacy: justificative adequacy, that is, not only what we observe
(descriptive adequacy) and how we think it occurs (explanatory adequacy) but
also what architectural properties (in terms of matter configuration, for
example) license the occurrence of certain phenomena. In the case of a
biological instantiation of a physical system, justificative adequacy is to be
found in the genotype-phenotype dynamics. Moreover, we will claim that such
dynamics should be analyzed from a mathematical point of view, since the
genotype is hypersensitive to initial conditions: a small change in a certain

the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth'. This
is a subtle logical statement usually felt as an evident truth. The problem we

1301.1439	q-bio	q-bio.PE cond-mat.stat-mech	Adaptive walks and distribution of beneficial fitness effects	"  We study the adaptation dynamics of a maladapted asexual population on rugged
fitness landscapes with many local fitness peaks. The distribution of
beneficial fitness effects is assumed to belong to one of the three extreme
value domains, viz. Weibull, Gumbel and Fr{\'e}chet. We work in the strong
selection-weak mutation regime in which beneficial mutations fix sequentially,
and the population performs an uphill walk on the fitness landscape until a
local fitness peak is reached. A striking prediction of our analysis is that
the fitness difference between successive steps follows a pattern of
diminishing returns in the Weibull domain and accelerating returns in the
Fr{\'e}chet domain, as the initial fitness of the population is increased.
These trends are found to be robust with respect to fitness correlations. We
believe that this result can be exploited in experiments to determine the
extreme value domain of the distribution of beneficial fitness effects. Our
work here differs significantly from the previous ones that assume the
selection coefficient to be small. On taking large effect mutations into
account, we find that the length of the walk shows different qualitative trends
from those derived using small selection coefficient approximation.

1301.3095	q-bio	q-bio.BM	Helices 2 and 3 are the initiation sites in the PrPc -> PrPsc transition	"  It is established that prion protein is the sole causative agent in a number
of diseases in humans and animals. However, the nature of conformational
changes that the normal cellular form PrPC undergoes in the conversion process
to a self-replicating state is still not fully understood. The ordered
C-terminus of PrPC proteins has three helices (H1, H2, and H3). Here, we use
the Statistical Coupling Analysis (SCA) to infer co-variations at various
locations using a family of evolutionarily related sequences, and the response
of mouse and human PrPCs to mechanical force to decipher the initiation sites
for transition from PrPC to an aggregation prone PrP* state. The sequence-based
SCA predicts that the clustered residues in non-mammals are localized in the
stable core (near H1) of PrPC whereas in mammalian PrPC they are localized in
the frustrated helices H2 and H3 where most of the pathogenic mutations are
found. Force-extension curves and free energy profiles as a function of
extension of mouse and human PrPC in the absence of disulfide (SS) bond between
residues Cys179 and Cys214, generated by applying mechanical force to the ends
of the molecule, show a sequence of unfolding events starting first with
rupture of H2 and H3. This is followed by disruption of structure in two
strands. Helix H1, stabilized by three salt-bridges, resists substantial force
before unfolding. Force extension profiles and the dynamics of rupture of
tertiary contacts also show that even in the presence of SS bond the
instabilities in most of H3 and parts of H2 still determine the propensity to
form the PrP* state. In mouse PrPC with SS bond there are about ten residues
that retain their order even at high forces.

1301.7187	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Emergence of Connectivity Motifs in Networks of Model Neurons with
  Short- and Long-term Plastic Synapses"	"  Recent evidence in rodent cerebral cortex and olfactory bulb suggests that
short-term dynamics of excitatory synaptic transmission is correlated to
stereotypical connectivity motifs. It was observed that neurons with short-term
facilitating synapses form predominantly reciprocal pairwise connections, while
neurons with short-term depressing synapses form unidirectional pairwise
connections. The cause of these structural differences in synaptic
microcircuits is unknown. We propose that these connectivity motifs emerge from
the interactions between short-term synaptic dynamics (SD) and long-term
spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). While the impact of STDP on SD was
shown in vitro, the mutual interactions between STDP and SD in large networks
are still the subject of intense research. We formulate a computational model
by combining SD and STDP, which captures faithfully short- and long-term
dependence on both spike times and frequency. As a proof of concept, we
simulate recurrent networks of spiking neurons with random initial connection
efficacies and where synapses are either all short-term facilitating or all
depressing. For identical background inputs, and as a direct consequence of
internally generated activity, we find that networks with depressing synapses
evolve unidirectional connectivity motifs, while networks with facilitating
synapses evolve reciprocal connectivity motifs. This holds for heterogeneous
networks including both facilitating and depressing synapses. Our study
highlights the conditions under which SD-STDP might the correlation between
facilitation and reciprocal connectivity motifs, as well as between depression
and unidirectional motifs. We further suggest experiments for the validation of
the proposed mechanism.

1302.4559	q-bio	q-bio.NC q-bio.QM	"Frequency dependence of signal power and spatial reach of the local
  field potential"	"  The first recording of electrical potential from brain activity was reported
already in 1875, but still the interpretation of the signal is debated. To take
full advantage of the new generation of microelectrodes with hundreds or even
thousands of electrode contacts, an accurate quantitative link between what is
measured and the underlying neural circuit activity is needed. Here we address
the question of how the observed frequency dependence of recorded local field
potentials (LFPs) should be interpreted. By use of a well-established
biophysical modeling scheme, combined with detailed reconstructed neuronal
morphologies, we find that correlations in the synaptic inputs onto a
population of pyramidal cells may significantly boost the low-frequency
components of the generated LFP. We further find that these low-frequency
components may be less `local' than the high-frequency LFP components in the
sense that (1) the size of signal-generation region of the LFP recorded at an
electrode is larger and (2) that the LFP generated by a synaptically activated
population spreads further outside the population edge due to volume
conduction.

positive (cooperative) interactions among the cells, and arbitrarily large
values of m. We consider two cases of the network's graph: the complete graph,
and the existence of a large core (i.e. a large complete subgraph). First, we
prove that the system periodically eventually synchronizes with a natural
""spiking period"" \ p >=1, and that if the cells are mutually structurally
identical or similar, then the synchronization is complete (p= 1) . Second, we
prove that the amount of information H that N generates or processes equals log
p. Therefore, if N completely synchronizes, the information is null. Finally,
we prove that N protects the cells from their risk of death.

or diet in response to prey abundance. In this paper, we study piecewise-smooth
models of predator-prey interactions with a linear trade-off in a predator's
prey preference. We consider optimally foraging predators and derive a model
for a 1 predator-2 prey interaction with a tilted switching manifold between
the two sides of discontinuous vector fields. We show that the 1 predator-2
prey system undergoes a novel adding-sliding-like (center to two-part periodic
orbit; ""C2PO"") bifurcation in which the prey ratio transitions from constant to
time-dependent. Further away from the bifurcation point, the period of the
oscillating prey ratio period doubles, suggesting a possible cascade to chaos.
We compare our model predictions with data and demonstrate that we successfully
capture the periodicity in the ratio between the predator's preferred and
alternative prey types in data on freshwater plankton. Our study suggests that
it is useful to investigate prey ratio as a possible indicator of how
population dynamics can be influenced by ecosystem diversity.

into a phylogenetic analysis pipeline or can be used as a subroutine within
another C++ program. As a test case, we applied this new tool to the published
phylome of Salinibacter ruber, a species of halophilic Bacteriodetes,
identifying 13 unique sister relationships to S. ruber across the 4589 gene
phylogenies. S. ruber grouped with bacteria, most often other Bacteriodetes, in
the majority of phylogenies, but 91 phylogenies showed a branch-supported
sister association between S. ruber and Archaea, an evolutionarily intriguing
relationship indicative of horizontal gene transfer. This test case
demonstrates how SICLE makes it possible to summarize the phylogenetic

1304.0118	q-bio	q-bio.PE q-bio.QM	Directional genetic differentiation and asymmetric migration	"  Understanding the population structure and patterns of gene flow within
species is of fundamental importance to the study of evolution. In the fields
of population and evolutionary genetics, measures of genetic differentiation
are commonly used to gather this information. One potential caveat is that
these measures assume gene flow to be symmetric. However, asymmetric gene flow
is common in nature, especially in systems driven by physical processes such as
wind or water currents. Since information about levels of asymmetric gene flow
among populations is essential for the correct interpretation of the
distribution of contemporary genetic diversity within species, this should not
be overlooked. To obtain information on asymmetric migration patterns from
genetic data, complex models based on maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches
generally need to be employed, often at great computational cost. Here, a new
simpler and more efficient approach for understanding gene flow patterns is
presented. This approach allows the estimation of directional components of
genetic divergence between pairs of populations at low computational effort,
using any of the classical or modern measures of genetic differentiation. These
directional measures of genetic differentiation can further be used to
calculate directional relative migration and to detect asymmetries in gene flow
patterns. This can be done in a user-friendly web application called
divMigrate-online introduced in this paper. Using simulated data sets with
known gene flow regimes, we demonstrate that the method is capable of resolving
complex migration patterns under a range of study designs.

independent random variable uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$, except
$(1,1,\ldots,1)$ which carries the value $1$ and $(0,0,\ldots,0)$ which carries
the value $x\in[0,1]$. We study the number $\Theta$ of paths from vertex
$(0,0,\ldots,0)$ to the opposite vertex $(1,1,\ldots,1)$ along which the values
on the nodes form an increasing sequence. We show that if the value on
$(0,0,\ldots,0)$ is set to $x=X/L$ then $\Theta/L$ converges in law as
$L\to\infty$ to $\mathrm{e}^{-X}$ times the product of two standard independent
exponential variables. As a first step in the analysis, we study the same
question when the graph is that of a tree where the root has arity $L$, each
node at level 1 has arity $L-1$, \ldots, and the nodes at level $L-1$ have only
one offspring which are the leaves of the tree (all the leaves are assigned the

order to identify biologically interesting subgroups. In particular, one may
wish to identify subgroups that are associated with a particular outcome of
interest. Conventional clustering methods generally do not identify such
subgroups, particularly when there are a large number of high-variance features
in the data set. Conventional methods may identify clusters associated with
these high-variance features when one wishes to obtain secondary clusters that
are more interesting biologically or more strongly associated with a particular
outcome of interest. A modification of sparse clustering can be used to
identify such secondary clusters or clusters associated with an outcome of

simulation scenarios. The method is also applied to a large prospective cohort

increase the capacity of this channel.

spatially extended systems called metapopulations. In the present study, we
investigate how dispersal affects the linear stability of a general
single-species metapopulation model. We discuss both the influence of local
within-patch dynamics and the effects of various dispersal behaviors on
stability. We find that positive density-dependent dispersal and positive
density-dependent settlement are destabilizing dispersal behaviors while
negative density-dependent dispersal and negative density-dependent settlement
are stabilizing. It is also shown that dispersal has a stabilizing impact on
heterogeneous metapopulations that correlates positively with the number of
patches and the connectance of metapopulation networks.

  sequence reads to genomic features"	"  Next-generation sequencing technologies generate millions of short sequence
reads, which are usually aligned to a reference genome. In many applications,
the key information required for downstream analysis is the number of reads
mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene. The
process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read summarization is
required for a great variety of genomic analyses but has so far received
relatively little attention in the literature. We present featureCounts, a read
summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from either RNA or
genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts implements highly efficient
chromosome hashing and feature blocking techniques. It is considerably faster
than existing methods (by an order of magnitude for gene-level summarization)
and requires far less computer memory. It works with either single or
paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options appropriate for different
sequencing applications. featureCounts is available under GNU General Public
License as part of the Subread (http://subread.sourceforge.net) or Rsubread

1305.3418	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Dynamical correlations in the escape strategy of Influenza A virus	"  The evolutionary dynamics of human Influenza A virus presents a challenging
theoretical problem. An extremely high mutation rate allows the virus to
escape, at each epidemic season, the host immune protection elicited by
previous infections. At the same time, at each given epidemic season a single
quasi-species, that is a set of closely related strains, is observed. A
non-trivial relation between the genetic (i.e., at the sequence level) and the
antigenic (i.e., related to the host immune response) distances can shed light
into this puzzle. In this paper we introduce a model in which, in accordance
with experimental observations, a simple interaction rule based on spatial
correlations among point mutations dynamically defines an immunity space in the
space of sequences. We investigate the static and dynamic structure of this
space and we discuss how it affects the dynamics of the virus-host interaction.
Interestingly we observe a staggered time structure in the virus evolution as
in the real Influenza evolutionary dynamics.

  brink of extinction"	"  Understanding the dynamics of metapopulations close to extinction is of vital
importance for management. Levins-like models, in which local patches are
treated as either occupied or empty, have been used extensively for this
purpose, but they ignore the important role of local population dynamics. In
this paper, we consider a stochastic metapopulation model where local
populations follow a Ricker dynamics, and use this framework to investigate the
behaviour of the metapopulation at the brink of extinction. As long as
dispersal rates are not too large, the system is shown to have a time evolution
consistent with Levins' dynamics. We derive analytical expressions for the
colonisation and extinction rates (c and e) in Levins-type models in terms of
reproduction, survival, and dispersal parameters of the local populations,
providing an avenue to parameterising Levins-like models from the type of
information on local demography that is available for a number of species. To
facilitate applying our results, we provide a numerical implementation for
computing c and e.

protein shell: the capsid. Spontaneous co-assembly of the genome and the capsid
proteins is driven predominantly by electrostatic interactions between the
negatively charged RNA and the positively charged inner capsid wall. Using
field theoretic formulation we show that the inherently branched RNA secondary
structure allows viruses to maximize the amount of encapsulated genome and make
assembly more efficient, allowing viral RNAs to out-compete cellular RNAs
during replication in infected host cells.

1306.3077	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Modeling Warfare in Social Animals: A ""Chemical"" Approach"	"  The aim of our study is to describe the dynamics of ant battles, with
reference to laboratory experiments, by means of a chemical stochastic model.
We focus on ants behavior as an interesting topic in order to predict the
ecological evolution of invasive species and their spreading. In our work we
want to describe the interactions between two groups of different ant species
with different war strategies. Our model considers the single ant individuals
and fighting groups in a way similar to atoms and molecules, respectively,
considering that ant fighting groups remain stable for a relative long time.
Starting from a system of differential non-linear equations (DE), derived from
the chemical reactions, we obtain a mean field description of the system. The
DE approach is valid when the number of individuals of each species is large in
the considered unit, while we consider battles of at most 10 vs. 10
individuals, due to the difficulties in following the individual behavior in a
large assembly. Therefore, we also adapt a Gillespie algorithm to reproduce the
fluctuations around the mean field. The DE scheme is exploited to characterize
the stochastic model. The set of parameters of chemical equations, obtained
using a minimization algorithm, are used by the Gillespie algorithm to generate
the stochastic trajectories. We then fit the stochastic paths with the DE, in
order to analyze the variability of the parameters and their variance. Finally,
we estimate the goodness of the applied methodology and we confirm that the
stochastic approach must be considered for a correct description of the ant
fighting dynamics. With respect to other war models, our chemical one considers
all phases of the battle and not only casualties. Thus, we can count on more
experimental data, but we also have more parameters to fit. In any case, our
model allows a much more detailed description of the fights.

the experimental and theoretical exploration of non-trivial quantum phenomena
in biological systems. In this tutorial overview we aim to bring out
fundamental assumptions and questions in the field, identify basic design
principles and develop a key underlying theme -- the dynamics of quantum
dynamical networks in the presence of an environment and the fruitful interplay
that the two may enter. At the hand of three biological phenomena whose
understanding is held to require quantum mechanical processes, namely
excitation and charge transfer in photosynthetic complexes, magneto-reception
in birds and the olfactory sense, we demonstrate that this underlying theme
encompasses them all, thus suggesting its wider relevance as an archetypical
framework for quantum biology.

1307.4296	q-bio	q-bio.MN cs.CE	"Prior Biological Knowledge And Epigenetic Information Enhances
  Prediction Accuracy Of Bayesian Wnt Pathway"	"  Computational modeling of Wnt signaling pathway has gained prominence for its
use as computer aided diagnostic tool to develop therapeutic cancer target
drugs and predict of test samples as cancerous and non cancerous. This
manuscript focuses on development of simple static bayesian network models of
varying complexity that encompasses prior partially available biological
knowledge about intra and extra cellular factors affecting the Wnt pathway and
incorporates epigenetic information like methylation and histone modification
of a few genes known to have inhibitory affect on Wnt pathway. It might be
expected that such models not only increase cancer prediction accuracies and
also form basis for understanding Wnt signaling activity in different states of
tumorigenesis. Initial results in human colorectal cancer cases indicate that
incorporation of epigenetic information increases prediction accuracy of test
samples as being tumorous or normal. Receiver Operator Curves (ROC) and their
respective area under the curve (AUC) measurements, obtained from predictions
of state of test sample and corresponding predictions of the state of
activation of transcription complex of the Wnt pathway for the test sample,
indicate that there is significant difference between the Wnt pathway being on
(off) and its association with the sample being tumorous (normal). Two sample
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirm the statistical deviation between the
distributions of these predictions. At a preliminary stage, use of these models
may help in understanding the yet unknown effect of certain factors like DKK2,
DKK3-1 and SFRP-2/3/5 on {\beta}-catenin transcription complex.

  Process"	"  In this paper we present an efficient model of the neuronal potentials
recorded by a deep brain stimulation microelectrode (DBS MER) in the
subthalamic nucleus. It is shown that a computationally efficient filtered
point process consisting of 10,000 neurons, including extracellular filtering
closely matches recordings from 13 Parkinson's disease patients. The recordings
were compared using their voltage amplitude distributions, power spectral
density estimates and phase synchrony. It was found that interspike interval
times modeled using a Weibull distribution with a shape parameter of 0.8,
slightly non-Poisosnian, gave the best fit of the simulations to patient
recordings. These results indicate that part of the `background activity'
present in an DBS MER can be considered to be a very local field potential due
to the surrounding neuronal activity.Therefore, the statistics of the
interspike interval times modify the structure of the background activity.

  phylogenetic substitution model"	"  We consider the continuous-time presentation of the strand symmetric
phylogenetic substitution model (in which rate parameters are unchanged under
nucleotide permutations given by Watson-Crick base conjugation). Algebraic
analysis of the model's underlying structure as a matrix group leads to a
change of basis where the rate generator matrix is given by a two-part block
decomposition. We apply representation theoretic techniques and, for any
(fixed) number of phylogenetic taxa $L$ and polynomial degree $D$ of interest,
provide the means to classify and enumerate the associated Markov invariants.
In particular, in the quadratic and cubic cases we prove there are precisely
1/3$(3^L+(-1)^L)$ and $6^{L-1}$ linearly independent Markov invariants,
respectively. Additionally, we give the explicit polynomial forms of the Markov
invariants for (i) the quadratic case with any number of taxa $L$, and (ii) the
cubic case in the special case of a three-taxa phylogenetic tree. We close by
showing our results are of practical interest since the quadratic Markov
invariants provide independent estimates of phylogenetic distances based on (i)
substitution rates within Watson-Crick conjugate pairs, and (ii) substitution
rates across conjugate base pairs.

  frequency of deleterious mutations"	"  We study the stationary state of a population evolving under the action of
random genetic drift, selection and recombination in which both deleterious and
reverse beneficial mutations can occur. We find that the equilibrium fraction
of deleterious mutations decreases as the population size is increased. We
calculate exactly the steady state frequency in a nonrecombining population
when population size is infinite and for a neutral finite population, and
obtain bounds on the fraction of deleterious mutations. We also find that for
small and very large populations, the number of deleterious mutations depends
weakly on recombination, but for moderately large populations, recombination
alleviates the effect of deleterious mutations. An analytical argument shows
that recombination decreases disadvantageous mutations appreciably when
beneficial mutations are rare as is the case in adapting microbial populations,
whereas it has a moderate effect on codon bias where the mutation rates between
the preferred and unpreferred codons are comparable.

1308.2273	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Evolutionary dynamics in finite populations with zealots	"  We investigate evolutionary dynamics of two-strategy matrix games with
zealots in finite populations. Zealots are assumed to take either strategy
regardless of the fitness. When the strategy selected by the zealots is the
same, the fixation of the strategy selected by the zealots is a trivial
outcome. We study fixation time in this scenario. We show that the fixation
time is divided into three main regimes, in one of which the fixation time is
short, and in the other two the fixation time is exponentially long in terms of
the population size. Different from the case without zealots, there is a
threshold selection intensity below which the fixation is fast for an arbitrary
payoff matrix. We illustrate our results with examples of various social
dilemma games.

colony sizes is described well by a continuous time branching process. To
characterize the shape fluctuations of the colonies, we compute the
distribution of eccentricities. The experimental results are compared with
numerical results for models of random division of elastic cells, showing that
experimental results are best reproduced by restricting cell division to the
outer rim of the colony. Our results serve to illustrate the wealth of

systematic analysis of Turing instability in such reaction-diffusion systems.
(i) We first introduce a unified framework to formulate the reaction-diffusion
system as an interconnected multi-agent dynamical system. (ii) Then, we
mathematically classify biologically plausible and implausible Turing
instabilities and characterize them by the root locus of each agent's dynamics,
or the local reaction dynamics. (iii) Using this characterization, we derive
analytic conditions for biologically plausible Turing instability, which
provide useful guidance for the design and the analysis of biological networks.
These results are demonstrated on an extended Gray-Scott model with a single
diffuser.

  Viruses"	"  The typical process for classifying and submitting a newly sequenced virus to
the NCBI database involves two steps. First, a BLAST search is performed to
determine likely family candidates. That is followed by checking the candidate
families with the Pairwise Sequence Alignment tool for similar species. The
submitter's judgement is then used to determine the most likely species
classification. The aim of this paper is to show that this process can be
automated into a fast, accurate, one-step process using the proposed
alignment-free method and properly implemented machine learning techniques.
  We present a new family of alignment-free vectorizations of the genome, the
generalized vector, that maintains the speed of existing alignment-free methods
while outperforming all available methods. This new alignment-free
vectorization uses the frequency of genomic words (k-mers), as is done in the
composition vector, and incorporates descriptive statistics of those k-mers'
positional information, as inspired by the natural vector.
  We analyze 5 different characterizations of genome similarity using
$k$-nearest neighbor classification, and evaluate these on two collections of
viruses totaling over 10,000 viruses. We show that our proposed method performs
better than, or as well as, other methods at every level of the phylogenetic
hierarchy.

  Modularity Properties of Gene Regulatory Networks"	"  Here we propose a new approach to modeling gene expression based on the
theory of random dynamical systems (RDS) that provides a general coupling
prescription between the nodes of any given regulatory network given the
dynamics of each node is modeled by a RDS. The main virtues of this approach
are the following: (i) it provides a natural way to obtain arbitrarily large
networks by coupling together simple basic pieces, thus revealing the
modularity of regulatory networks; (ii) the assumptions about the stochastic
processes used in the modeling are fairly general, in the sense that the only
requirement is stationarity; (iii) there is a well developed mathematical
theory, which is a blend of smooth dynamical systems theory, ergodic theory and
stochastic analysis that allows one to extract relevant dynamical and
statistical information without solving the system; (iv) one may obtain the
classical rate equations form the corresponding stochastic version by averaging
the dynamic random variables (small noise limit). It is important to emphasize
that unlike the deterministic case, where coupling two equations is a trivial
matter, coupling two RDS is non-trivial, specially in our case, where the
coupling is performed between a state variable of one gene and the switching
stochastic process of another gene and, hence, it is not a priori true that the
resulting coupled system will satisfy the definition of a random dynamical
system. We shall provide the necessary arguments that ensure that our coupling
prescription does indeed furnish a coupled regulatory network of random
dynamical systems. Finally, the fact that classical rate equations are the
small noise limit of our stochastic model ensures that any validation or
prediction made on the basis of the classical theory is also a validation or
prediction of our model.

of a single chiral form of biomolecules in living organisms is specifically
determined by the electron spin state during their enzyme-catalyzed synthesis
processes. Specifically speaking, the electrons released from the coenzyme
NAD(P)H of amino acid synthase are heterogeneous in spin states; however, when
they pass through the chiral alpha-helix structure of the enzymes to the site
of amino acid synthesis at the other end of the helix, their spin states are
filtered and polarized, producing only spin up electrons; once the
spin-polarized electrons participate in the reductive reaction between
alpha-oxo acid and ammonia, only L-amino acids are formed according to the
Pauli exclusion principle.

which is used to jointly analyze small angle x-ray and neutron scattering data
from unilamellar vesicles, for use with data from fully hydrated, liquid
crystalline multilamellar vesicles (MLVs). By using a genetic algorithm, this
new method is capable of providing high resolution structural information, as

lipid were determined for a series of saturated and unsaturated lipids, as well
as binary mixtures with cholesterol. Results are in good agreement with
previously reported SDP data, which used both neutron and x-ray data. The

two-scale convergence methods to derive the homogenized macroscopic equations.
In establishing our results, we also derive a priori estimates for the
Keller-Segel system that rely only on the boundedness of the coefficients; in

coefficients for the chemotactic species is required. Finally, we prove the

demonstrate here that a statistical model decomposing networks into matching
and centrality components provides a comprehensive and unifying quantification
of their architecture. First we show, for a diverse set of networks, that this
decomposition provides an extremely tight fit to observed networks.
Consequently, the model allows very accurate prediction of missing links in
partially known networks. Second, when node characteristics are known, we show
how the matching-centrality decomposition can be related to this external
information. Consequently, it offers a simple and versatile tool to explore how
node characteristics explain network architecture. Finally, we demonstrate the
efficiency and flexibility of the model to forecast the links that a novel node

problems such as clean energy and environmental protection. However, little is
known about how individuals can coordinate themselves for a certain level of
cooperation in large populations of strangers. In a typical situation, a
consensus-building process hardly succeeds due to lack of face and standing.
The evolution of cooperation in this type of situation is studied using
threshold public good games in which cooperation prevails when it is initially
sufficient, or otherwise, it perishes. While punishment is a powerful tool to
shape human behaviours, institutional punishment is often too costly to start
with only a few contributors, which is another coordination problem. Here we
show that whatever the initial conditions, reward funds based on voluntary
contribution can evolve. The voluntary reward paves the way for effectively
overcoming the coordination problem and efficiently transforms freeloaders to
cooperators with a perceived small risk of collective failure.

well as of uni- and bimodal continuous distributions are studied with a focus
on different topologies, i.e., regular, small-world, and random networks. In
the case of two discrete delay times resonance effects play a major role:
Depending on the ratio of the delay times, various characteristic spiking
scenarios, such as coherent or asynchronous spiking, arise. For continuous
delay distributions different dynamical patterns emerge depending on the width
of the distribution. For small distribution widths, we find highly synchronized
spiking, while for intermediate widths only spiking with low degree of
synchrony persists, which is associated with traveling disruptions, partial
amplitude death, or subnetwork synchronization, depending sensitively on the
network topology. If the inhomogeneity of the coupling delays becomes too
large, global amplitude death is induced.

problem that has attracted many studies. However, most existing models are
adapted from biological epidemic ones. Although biological epidemic models can
certainly be adapted to capture some computer virus spreading scenarios
(especially when the so-called homogeneity assumption holds), the problem of
computer virus spreading is not well understood because it has many important
perspectives that are not necessarily accommodated in the biological epidemic
models. In this paper we initiate the study of such a perspective, namely that
of adaptive defense against epidemic spreading in arbitrary networks. More
specifically, we investigate a non-homogeneous
Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) model where the model parameters may
vary with respect to time. In particular, we focus on two scenarios we call
semi-adaptive defense and fully-adaptive} defense, which accommodate implicit
and explicit dependency relationships between the model parameters,
respectively. In the semi-adaptive defense scenario, the model's input
parameters are given; the defense is semi-adaptive because the adjustment is
implicitly dependent upon the outcome of virus spreading. For this scenario, we
present a set of sufficient conditions (some are more general or succinct than
others) under which the virus spreading will die out; such sufficient
conditions are also known as epidemic thresholds in the literature. In the
fully-adaptive defense scenario, some input parameters are not known (i.e., the
aforementioned sufficient conditions are not applicable) but the defender can
observe the outcome of virus spreading. For this scenario, we present adaptive
control strategies under which the virus spreading will die out or will be
contained to a desired level.

1311.6216	q-bio	math.DS q-bio.PE	Evaluating the Usefulness of Paratransgenesis for Malaria Control	"  Malaria is a serious global health problem which is especially devastating to
the developing world. Mosquitoes are the carriers of the parasite responsible
for the disease, and hence malaria control programs focus on controlling
mosquito populations. This is done primarily through the spraying of
insecticides, or through the use of insecticide treated bed nets. However,
usage of these insecticides exerts massive selection pressure on mosquitoes,
resulting in insecticide resistant mosquito breeds. Hence, developing
alternative strategies is crucial for sustainable malaria control. Here we
explore the usefulness of paratransgenesis, i.e., introducing genetically
engineered bacteria which secrete anti-plasmodium molecules, inside the
mosquito midgut. The bacteria enter a mosquito's midgut when it drinks from a
sugar bait, i.e., a sugar solution containing the bacterium. We formulate a
mathematical model for evaluating the number of such baits required for
preventing an outbreak. We study scenarios where vectors and hosts mix
homogeneously as well as heterogeneously. We perform a full stability analysis
and calculate the basic reproductive number for both the cases. Additionally,
for the heterogeneous mixing scenario, we propose a targeted bait distribution
strategy. The optimal bait allocation is calculated and is found to be
extremely efficient in terms of bait usage. Our analyses suggest that

1312.3670	q-bio	math.DS q-bio.CB q-bio.PE	The Effects of Latent Infection on the Dynamics of HIV	"  One way in which the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) replicates within a
host is by infecting activated CD4+ T-cells, which then produce additional
copies of the virus. Even with the introduction of antiretroviral drug therapy,
which has been very successful over the past decade, a large obstacle to the
complete eradication of the virus is the presence of viral reservoirs in the
form of latently infected CD4+ T-cells. We consider a model of HIV infection
that describes T-cell and viral interactions, as well as, the production and
activation of latently infected T-cells. Upon determining equilibrium states of
the latent cell model, the local and global asymptotic behavior of solutions is
examined, and the basic reproduction number of the system is computed to be
strictly less than that of the corresponding three-component model, which omits
the effects of latent infection. In particular, this implies that a wider
variety of parameter values will lead to viral eradication as $t \to \infty$
due to the appearance of latent CD4+ T-cells. With this realization we discuss
possible alternative notions for eradication and persistence of infection other
than traditional tools. These results are further illustrated by a number of
numerical simulations.

1312.4152	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Numerical responses in resource-based mutualisms: a time scale approach	"  In mutualisms where there is exchange of resources for resources, or
resources for services, the resources are typically short lived compared with
the lives of the organisms that produce and make use of them. This fact allows
a separation of time scales, by which the numerical response of one species
with respect to the abundance of another can be derived mechanistically. These
responses can account for intra-specific competition, due to the partition of
the resources provided by mutualists, in this way connecting competition theory
and mutualism at a microscopic level. It is also possible to derive saturating
responses in the case of species that provide resources but expect a service in
return (e.g. pollination, seed dispersal) instead of food or nutrients. In both
situations, competition and saturation have the same underlying cause, which is
that the generation of resources occur at a finite velocity per individual of
the providing species, but their depletion happens much faster due to the
acceleration in growth rates that characterizes mutualism. The resulting models
can display all the basic features seen in many models of facultative and
obligate mutualisms, and they can be generalized from species pairs to larger
communities. The parameters of the numerical responses can be related with
quantities that can be in principle measured, and that can be related by
trade-offs, which can be useful for studying the evolution of mutualisms.

1312.4318	q-bio	cs.SY q-bio.QM	"Computing Scalable Multivariate Glocal Invariants of Large (Brain-)
  Graphs"	"  Graphs are quickly emerging as a leading abstraction for the representation
of data. One important application domain originates from an emerging
discipline called ""connectomics"". Connectomics studies the brain as a graph;
vertices correspond to neurons (or collections thereof) and edges correspond to
structural or functional connections between them. To explore the variability
of connectomes---to address both basic science questions regarding the
structure of the brain, and medical health questions about psychiatry and
neurology---one can study the topological properties of these brain-graphs. We
define multivariate glocal graph invariants: these are features of the graph
that capture various local and global topological properties of the graphs. We
show that the collection of features can collectively be computed via a
combination of daisy-chaining, sparse matrix representation and computations,
and efficient approximations. Our custom open-source Python package serves as a
back-end to a Web-service that we have created to enable researchers to upload
graphs, and download the corresponding invariants in a number of different
formats. Moreover, we built this package to support distributed processing on
multicore machines. This is therefore an enabling technology for network
science, lowering the barrier of entry by providing tools to biologists and
analysts who otherwise lack these capabilities. As a demonstration, we run our
code on 120 brain-graphs, each with approximately 16M vertices and up to 90M
edges.

1312.4644	q-bio	physics.soc-ph q-bio.PE	A generic model of dyadic social relationships	"  We introduce a model of dyadic social interactions and establish its
correspondence with relational models theory (RMT), a theory of human social
relationships. RMT posits four elementary models of relationships governing
human interactions, singly or in combination: Communal Sharing, Authority
Ranking, Equality Matching, and Market Pricing. To these are added the limiting
cases of asocial and null interactions, whereby people do not coordinate with
reference to any shared principle. Our model is rooted in the observation that
each individual in a dyadic interaction can do either the same thing as the
other individual, a different thing or nothing at all. To represent these three
possibilities, we consider two individuals that can each act in one out of
three ways toward the other: perform a social action X or Y, or alternatively
do nothing. We demonstrate that the relationships generated by this model
aggregate into six exhaustive and disjoint categories. We propose that four of
these categories match the four relational models, while the remaining two
correspond to the asocial and null interactions defined in RMT. We generalize
our results to the presence of N social actions. We infer that the four
relational models form an exhaustive set of all possible dyadic relationships
based on social coordination. Hence, we contribute to RMT by offering an answer
to the question of why there could exist just four relational models. In
addition, we discuss how to use our representation to analyze data sets of
dyadic social interactions, and how social actions may be valued and matched by
the agents.

develop a novel nonparametric non-Euclidean reliability metric. Here we provide
an overview of the methods used, demonstrate our implementation, and discuss
available user extensions. We conclude with results showing the efficacy and
reliability of the pipeline over previous state-of-the-art.

  densely sampled genetic data"	"  Whole genome sequencing of pathogens from multiple hosts in an epidemic
offers the potential to investigate who infected whom with unparalleled
resolution, potentially yielding important insights into disease dynamics and
the impact of control measures. We considered disease outbreaks in a setting
with dense genomic sampling, and formulated stochastic epidemic models to
investigate person-to-person transmission, based on observed genomic and
epidemiological data. We constructed models in which the genetic distance
between sampled genotypes depends on the epidemiological relationship between
the hosts. A data augmented Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm was used to
sample over the transmission trees, providing a posterior probability for any
given transmission route. We investigated the predictive performance of our
methodology using simulated data, demonstrating high sensitivity and
specificity, particularly for rapidly mutating pathogens with low
transmissibility. We then analyzed data collected during an outbreak of
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a hospital, identifying probable
transmission routes and estimating epidemiological parameters. Our approach
overcomes limitations of previous methods, providing a framework with the
flexibility to allow for unobserved infection times, multiple independent
introductions of the pathogen, and within-host genetic diversity, as well as
allowing forward simulation.

This phenomenon has been observed in biological processes such as endocytosis,
tubulation and vesiculation. However, it is not clear how the local surface
properties of the membrane, such as membrane tension, change in response to
protein adsorption. In this paper, we show that the classical elastic model of
lipid membranes cannot account for simultaneous changes in shape and membrane
tension due to protein adsorption in a local region, and a viscous-elastic
formulation is necessary to fully describe the system. Therefore, we develop a
viscous-elastic model for inhomogeneous membranes of the Helfrich type. Using
the new viscous-elastic model, we find that the lipids flow to accommodate
changes in membrane curvature during protein adsorption. We show that, at the
end of protein adsorption process, the system sustains a residual local tension
to balance the difference between the actual mean curvature and the imposed
spontaneous curvatures. This change in membrane tension can have a functional
impact in many biological phenomena where proteins interact with membranes.

simulating the behavior of this molecule under various conditions, including
those required for nanotechnology. However, none of these models reproduces the
DNA polymorphism associated with conformational changes in the ribose rings of
the DNA backbone. These changes make an essential contribution to the DNA local
deformability and provide the possibility of the transition of the DNA double
helix from the B-form to the A-form during interactions with biological
molecules. We propose a CG representation of the ribose conformational
flexibility. We substantiate the choice of the CG sites (6 per nucleotide)
needed for the ""sugar"" GC DNA model, and obtain the potentials of the CG
interactions between the sites by the ""bottom-up"" approach using the all-atom
AMBER force field. We show that the representation of the ribose flexibility
requires one non-harmonic and one three-particle potential, the forms of both
the potentials being different from the ones generally used. The model also
includes (i) explicit representation of ions (in an implicit solvent) and (ii)
sequence dependence. With these features, the sugar CG DNA model reproduces
(with the same parameters) both the B- and A- stable forms under corresponding
conditions and demonstrates both the A to B and the B to A phase transitions.

1401.3518	q-bio	stat.AP q-bio.NC	"Percolation under Noise: Detecting Explosive Percolation Using the
  Second Largest Component"	"  We consider the problem of distinguishing classical (Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi)
percolation from explosive (Achlioptas) percolation, under noise. A statistical
model of percolation is constructed allowing for the birth and death of edges
as well as the presence of noise in the observations. This graph-valued
stochastic process is composed of a latent and an observed non-stationary
process, where the observed graph process is corrupted by Type I and Type II
errors. This produces a hidden Markov graph model. We show that for certain
choices of parameters controlling the noise, the classical (ER) percolation is
visually indistinguishable from the explosive (Achlioptas) percolation model.
In this setting, we compare two different criteria for discriminating between
these two percolation models, based on a quantile difference (QD) of the first
component's size and on the maximal size of the second largest component. We
show through data simulations that this second criterion outperforms the QD of
the first component's size, in terms of discriminatory power. The maximal size
of the second component therefore provides a useful statistic for
distinguishing between the ER and Achlioptas models of percolation, under
physically motivated conditions for the birth and death of edges, and under
noise. The potential application of the proposed criteria for percolation
detection in clinical neuroscience is also discussed.

1401.4913	q-bio	q-bio.QM physics.soc-ph q-bio.MN	Communication on structure of biological networks	"  Networks are widely used to represent interaction pattern among the
components in complex systems. Structures of real networks from differ- ent
domains may vary quite significantly. Since there is an interplay be- tween
network architecture and dynamics, structure plays an important role in
communication and information spreading on a network. Here we investigate the
underlying undirected topology of different biological networks which support
faster spreading of information and are better in communication. We analyze the
good expansion property by using the spectral gap and communicability between
nodes. Different epidemic models are also used to study the transmission of
information in terms of disease spreading through individuals (nodes) in those
networks. More- over, we explore the structural conformation and properties
which may be responsible for better communication. Among all biological
networks studied here, the undirected structure of neuronal networks not only
pos- sesses the small-world property but the same is expressed remarkably to a
higher degree than any randomly generated network which possesses the same
degree sequence. A relatively high percentage of nodes, in neuronal networks,
form a higher core in their structure. Our study shows that the underlying
undirected topology in neuronal networks is significantly qualitatively
different than the same from other biological networks and that they may have
evolved in such a way that they inherit a (undirected) structure which is
excellent and robust in communication.

response to chemical signals secreted by, for example, a wound or a tumour. In
this paper, we propose a mesoscopic lattice-based model of angiogenesis, in
which processes that include proliferation and cell movement are considered as
stochastic events. By studying the dependence of the model on the lattice
spacing and the number of cells involved, we are able to derive the
deterministic continuum limit of our equations and compare it to similar
existing models of angiogenesis. We further identify conditions under which the
use of continuum models is justified, and others for which stochastic or
discrete effects dominate. We also compare different stochastic models for the
movement of endothelial tip cells which have the same macroscopic,
deterministic behaviour, but lead to markedly different behaviour in terms of
production of new vessel cells.

1402.0104	q-bio	math.CO q-bio.QM	The Combinatorics of Tandem Duplication	"  Tandem duplication is an evolutionary process whereby a segment of DNA is
replicated and proximally inserted. The different configurations that can arise
from this process give rise to some interesting combinatorial questions.
Firstly, we introduce an algebraic formalism to represent this process as a
word producing automaton. The number of words arising from n tandem
duplications can then be recursively derived. Secondly, each single word
accounts for multiple evolutions. With the aid of a bi-coloured 2d- tree, a
Hasse diagram corresponding to a partially ordered set is constructed, from
which we can count the number of evolutions corresponding to a given word.
Thirdly, we implement some subtree prune and graft operations on this structure
to show that the total number of possible evolutions arising from n tandem
duplications is $\prod_{k=1}^n(4^k - (2k + 1))$. The space of structures
arising from tandem duplication thus grows at a super-exponential rate with
leading order term $\mathcal{O}(4^{\frac{1}{2}n^2})$.

- stemmed from stochastic process theory - two sets of experiments designed to
infer the spontaneous organization of leukocytes against cancer cells, namely
mice splenocytes vs. B16 mouse tumor cells, and embedded in an ""ad hoc""
microfluidic environment developed on a LabOnChip technology. In the former,
splenocytes from knocked out (KO) mice engineered to silence the transcription
factor IRF-8, crucial for the development and function of several immune
populations, were used. In this case lymphocytes and cancer cells exhibited a
poor reciprocal exchange, resulting in the inability of coordinating or
mounting an effective immune response against melanoma. In the second class of
tests, wild type (WT) splenocytes were able to interact with and to coordinate
a response against the tumor cells through physical interaction. The
environment where cells moved was built of by two different chambers,
containing respectively melanoma cells and splenocytes, connected by capillary
migration channels allowing leucocytes to migrate from their chamber toward the
melanoma one. We collected and analyzed data on the motility of the cells and
found that the first ensemble of IRF-8 KO cells performed pure uncorrelated
random walks, while WT splenocytes were able to make singular drifted random
walks, that, averaged over the ensemble of cells, collapsed on a straight
ballistic motion for the system as a whole. At a finer level of investigation,
we found that IRF-8 KO splenocytes moved rather uniformly since their step
lengths were exponentially distributed, while WT counterpart displayed a
qualitatively broader motion as their step lengths along the direction of the
melanoma were log-normally distributed.

1402.0640	q-bio	q-bio.GN	"Alignment-free comparison of next-generation sequencing data using
  compression-based distance measures"	"  Enormous volumes of short reads data from next-generation sequencing (NGS)
technologies have posed new challenges to the area of genomic sequence
comparison.
  The multiple sequence alignment approach is hardly applicable to NGS data due
to the challenging problem of short read assembly.
  Thus alignment-free methods need to be developed for the comparison of NGS
samples of short reads.
  Recently, new $k$-mer based distance measures such as {\it CVTree},
$d_{2}^{S}$, {\it co-phylog} have been proposed to address this problem.
  However, those distances depend considerably on the parameter $k$, and how to
choose the optimal $k$ is not trivial since it may depend on different aspects
of the sequence data.
  Hence, in this paper we consider an alternative parameter-free approach:
compression-based distance measures.
  These measures have shown impressive performance on long genome sequences in
previous studies, but they have not been tested on NGS short reads.
  In this study we perform extensive validation and show that the
compression-based distances are highly consistent with those distances obtained
from the $k$-mer based methods, from the alignment-based approach, and from
existing benchmarks in the literature.
  Moreover, as these measures are parameter-free, no optimization is required
and they still perform consistently well on multiple types of sequence data,
for different kinds of species and taxonomy levels.
  The compression-based distance measures are assembly-free, alignment-free,
parameter-free, and thus represent useful tools for the comparison of long
genome sequences and NGS samples of short reads.

  Tube with Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy and Ultra Violet Absorption
  Spectroscopy"	"  Anomalous surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) peaks are identified for
liquid sample stored in polypropylene centrifuge tubes (PP tube) for months. We
observed the unexpected Raman peaks during experiments for Thiamine
Hydrochloride aqueous solution stored in PP tube for two months. In order to
identify the contaminants we have performed SERS experiments for de-ionized
water (DI water) stored in polypropylene centrifuge tube for two months and
compared them with fresh DI water sample. We have also carried out Ultra Violet
(UV) absorption spectra for both fresh and contaminated water. We believe that
the water is contaminated because of chemicals leaching from the PP tube. From
the GC-MS data the main contaminant was found to be Phthalic acid and its
derivatives. Further SERS and UV absorption experiment for Phthalic acid
correlates well with the anomalous peaks identified earlier. We qualitatively
confirmed the identification and quantitatively estimated the concentration of
suspect contaminants as between 1uM and 10uM with both SERS and UV absorption
spectroscopy. With UV absorption spectroscopy, we precisely estimate the
concentration as 2.1uM. We have shown that sample in PP tube can be
contaminated due to leaching chemicals upon long term storage and suggested
SERS and UV-absorption spectroscopy as two quick and simple techniques to
detect the contamination

1402.1769	q-bio	math.PR q-bio.PE	"The fixation time of a strongly beneficial allele in a structured
  population"	"  For a beneficial allele which enters a large unstructured population and
eventually goes to fixation, it is known that the time to fixation is
approximately $2\log(\alpha)/\alpha$ for a large selection coefficient
$\alpha$. For a population that is distributed over finitely many colonies,
with migration between these colonies, we detect various regimes of the
migration rate $\mu$ for which the fixation times have different asymptotics as
$\alpha \to \infty$. If $\mu$ is of order $\alpha$, the allele fixes (as in the
spatially unstructured case) in time $\sim 2\log(\alpha)/\alpha$. If $\mu$ is
of order $\alpha^\gamma, 0\leq \gamma \leq 1$, the fixation time is $\sim (2 +
(1-\gamma)\Delta) \log(\alpha)/\alpha$, where $\Delta$ is the number of
migration steps that are needed to reach all other colonies starting from the
colony where the beneficial allele appeared. If $\mu = 1/\log(\alpha)$, the
fixation time is $\sim (2+S)\log(\alpha)/\alpha$, where $S$ is a random time in
a simple epidemic model.
  The main idea for our analysis is to combine a new moment dual for the
process conditioned to fixation with the time reversal in equilibrium of a
spatial version of Neuhauser and Krone's ancestral selection graph.

1402.1802	q-bio	q-bio.QM q-bio.PE	A unifying framework for quantifying the nature of animal interactions	"  Collective phenomena, whereby agent-agent interactions determine spatial
patterns, are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom. On the other hand, movement and
space use are also greatly influenced by the interactions between animals and
their environment. Despite both types of interaction fundamentally influencing
animal behaviour, there has hitherto been no unifying framework for the models
proposed in both areas. Here, we construct a general method for inferring
population-level spatial patterns from underlying individual movement and
interaction processes, a key ingredient in building a statistical mechanics for
ecological systems. We show that resource selection functions, as well as
several examples of collective motion models, arise as special cases of our
framework, thus bringing together resource selection analysis and collective
animal behaviour into a single theory. In particular, we focus on combining the
various mechanistic models of territorial interactions in the literature with
step selection functions, by incorporate interactions into the step selection
framework and demonstrating how to derive territorial patterns from the
resulting models. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model by application to a
population of insectivore birds in the Amazon rainforest.

therapy in liver transplant recipients to decrease the risk of acute rejection
while allowing the reduction of concomitant immunosuppression. The exact
association with the use of IL-2RA however is uncertain. We performed a
systematic literature search for relevant studies. Random effects models were
used to assess the incidence of acute rejection, steroid-resistant rejection,
graft loss, patient death, and adverse drug reaction, with or without IL-2RA.
Six studies (2 randomized and 4 nonrandomized) met the elegibility criteria.
Acute rejection at 6 months or later favored the use of IL-2RA significantly
(relative risk (RR) 0.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22-0.66, p = 0.0005).
Although not statistically significant, IL-2RA showed a substantial reduction
of the risk of steroid-resistant rejection (RR 0.32; CI 0.19-1.03, p = 0.0594).
Graft loss and patient death showed a reductive tendency through the use of
IL-2RA. The use of IL-2RA is safe and is associated with a statistically
significantly lower incidence of acute rejection after transplantation and
substantial reduction of steroid-resistant rejection, graft loss and patient
death.

individuals may be recruited into the population at different sizes. First and
second order finite difference schemes are developed to approximate the
solution of the mathematical model. The convergence of the approximations to a
unique weak solution with bounded total variation is proved. We then show that
as the distribution of the new recruits become concentrated at the smallest
size, the weak solution of the distributed states-at-birth model converges to
the weak solution of the classical Gurtin-McCamy-type size-structured model in
the weak$^*$ topology. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the
achievement of the desired accuracy of the two methods for smooth solutions as
well as the superior performance of the second-order method in resolving
solution-discontinuities. Finally we provide an example where supercritical
Hopf-bifurcation occurs in the limiting single state-at-birth model and we
apply the second-order numerical scheme to show that such bifurcation occurs in

Particularly interesting is the case when the expressed protein regulates its

Either a protein is bound to its promoter or not. The steady state

Moreover a powerful numerical method based on the corresponding master equation
to compute the protein distribution in the steady state is presented and
compared to an already existing method. Additionally the special case of
self-regulation, in which protein can only be produced, if one of these
proteins is bound to the promoter region, is analyzed. Furthermore a
self-regulating gene is compared to a similar gene, which also has two states
and produces the same amount of proteins but is not regulated by its
protein-product.

concentration-based auxin transport models, posed on static plant tissues.
Using standard asymptotic analysis we prove that, on bounded domains, auxin
peaks are not formed via a Turing instability in the active transport
parameter, but via simple corrections to the homogeneous steady state. When the
active transport is small, the geometry of the tissue encodes the peaks'
amplitude and location: peaks arise where cells have fewer neighbours, that is,
at the boundary of the domain. We test our theory and perform numerical
bifurcation analysis on two models which are known to generate auxin patterns
for biologically plausible parameter values. In the same parameter regimes, we
find that realistic tissues are capable of generating a multitude of stationary
patterns, with a variable number of auxin peaks, that can be selected by
different initial conditions or by quasi-static changes in the active transport
parameter. The competition between active transport and production rate
determines whether peaks remain localised or cover the entire domain. We relate
the occurrence of localised patterns to a snaking bifurcation structure, which
is known to arise in a wide variety of nonlinear media but has not yet been
reported in plant models.

arteries on all length scales, and that the optimised arterial trees improve
systematically as computational time increases. The method presented here is
general, and could in principle be used to examine the arteries of other

towards understanding the selective pressures that affect the evolution of the
strategies of agents engaged in interactions with potential conflicts. While a
mathematical treatment of the costs and benefits of decisions can predict the
optimal strategy in simple settings, more realistic settings such as finite
populations, non-vanishing mutations rates, stochastic decisions, communication
between agents, and spatial interactions, require agent-based methods where
each agent is modeled as an individual, carries its own genes that determine
its decisions, and where the evolutionary outcome can only be ascertained by
evolving the population of agents forward in time. While highlighting standard
mathematical results, we compare those to agent-based methods that can go
beyond the limitations of equations and simulate the complexity of
heterogeneous populations and an ever-changing set of interactors. We conclude
that agent-based methods can predict evolutionary outcomes where purely
mathematical treatments cannot tread (for example in the weak selection--strong
mutation limit), but that mathematics is crucial to validate the computational
simulations.

in eukaryotic nuclei. Here we provide a scaling theory and dissipative particle
dynamics (DPD) computer simulation for the thermal motion of monomers in the
fractal globule state. Simulations starting from different entanglement-free
initial states show good convergence which provides evidence supporting the
existence of unique metastable fractal globule state. We show monomer motion in
this state to be sub-diffusive described by $\langle X^2 (t)\rangle \sim
t^{\alpha_F}$ with $\alpha_F$ close to 0.4. This result is in good agreement
with existing experimental data on the chromatin dynamics which makes an
additional argument in support of the fractal globule model of chromatin
packing.

neuron and a synapse: currents allow convenient summation of multiple inputs,
while the magnet provides the threshold function. The objective of this paper
is to explore the possibility of a hardware neural network (HNN) implementation
using a spin switch (SS) as its basic building block. SS is a recently proposed
device based on established technology with a transistor-like gain and
input-output isolation. This allows neural networks to be constructed with
purely passive interconnections without intervening clocks or amplifiers. The
weights for the neural network are conveniently adjusted through analog
voltages that can be stored in a non-volatile manner in an underlying CMOS
layer using a floating gate low dropout voltage regulator. The operation of a
multi-layer SS neural network designed for character recognition is
demonstrated using a standard simulation model based on coupled
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equations, one for each magnet in the network.

A viruses undergo rapid antigenic drift and identification of emerging
antigenic variants is critical to the vaccine selection process. Using former
seasonal influenza A(H1N1) viruses, hemagglutinin sequence and corresponding
antigenic data were analyzed in combination with 3-D structural information. We
attributed variation in hemagglutination inhibition to individual amino acid
substitutions and quantified their antigenic impact, validating a subset
experimentally using reverse genetics. Substitutions identified as low-impact
were shown to be a critical component of influenza antigenic evolution and by
including these, as well as the high-impact substitutions often focused on, the
accuracy of predicting antigenic phenotypes of emerging viruses from genotype
was doubled. The ability to quantify the phenotypic impact of specific amino
acid substitutions should help refine techniques that predict the fitness and
evolutionary success of variant viruses, leading to stronger theoretical
foundations for selection of candidate vaccine viruses.

1404.4804	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Dynamical transitions in a pollination--herbivory interaction	"  Plant-pollinator associations are often seen as purely mutualistic, while in
reality they can be more complex. Indeed they may also display a diverse array
of antagonistic interactions, such as competition and victim--exploiter
interactions. In some cases mutualistic and antagonistic interactions are
carried-out by the same species but at different life-stages. As a consequence,
population structure affects the balance of inter-specific associations, a
topic that is receiving increased attention. In this paper, we developed a
model that captures the basic features of the interaction between a flowering
plant and an insect with a larval stage that feeds on the plant's vegetative
tissues (e.g. leaves) and an adult pollinator stage. Our model is able to
display a rich set of dynamics, the most remarkable of which involves
victim--exploiter oscillations that allow plants to attain abundances above
their carrying capacities, and the periodic alternation between states
dominated by mutualism or antagonism. Our study indicates that changes in the
insect's life cycle can modify the balance between mutualism and antagonism,
causing important qualitative changes in the interaction dynamics. These
changes in the life cycle could be caused by a variety of external drivers,
such as temperature, plant nutrients, pesticides and changes in the diet of
adult pollinators.

revival in the study of metabolic networks, which increased the demand for
efficient vertex enumeration algorithms for high-dimensional polyhedra given by
inequalities. It is a famous and long standing open question in polyhedral
theory and computational geometry whether the vertices of a polytope (bounded
polyhedron), described by a set of linear constraints, can be enumerated in
total polynomial time. In this paper we apply the concept of
branch-decomposition to the vertex enumeration problem of polyhedra $P = \{x :
Ax = b, x \geq 0\}$. For this purpose, we introduce the concept of $k$-module
and show how it relates to the separators of the linear matroid generated by
the columns of $A$. We then use this to present a total polynomial time
algorithm for polytopes $P$ for which the branch-width of the linear matroid
generated by $A$ is bounded by a constant $k$.

1404.6520	q-bio	q-bio.QM q-bio.PE	How to partition diversity	"  Diversity measurement underpins the study of biological systems, but measures
used vary across disciplines. Despite their common use and broad utility, no
unified framework has emerged for measuring, comparing and partitioning
diversity. The introduction of information theory into diversity measurement
has laid the foundations, but the framework is incomplete without the ability
to partition diversity, which is central to fundamental questions across the
life sciences: How do we prioritise communities for conservation? How do we
identify reservoirs and sources of pathogenic organisms? How do we measure
ecological disturbance arising from climate change?
  The lack of a common framework means that diversity measures from different
fields have conflicting fundamental properties, allowing conclusions reached to
depend on the measure chosen. This conflict is unnecessary and unhelpful. A
mathematically consistent framework would transform disparate fields by
delivering scientific insights in a common language. It would also allow the
transfer of theoretical and practical developments between fields.
  We meet this need, providing a versatile unified framework for partitioning
biological diversity. It encompasses any kind of similarity between
individuals, from functional to genetic, allowing comparisons between
qualitatively different kinds of diversity. Where existing partitioning
measures aggregate information across the whole population, our approach
permits the direct comparison of subcommunities, allowing us to pinpoint
distinct, diverse or representative subcommunities and investigate population
substructure. The framework is provided as a ready-to-use R package to easily
test our approach.

species (phylogeny or species tree) from several genes. It is known that the
evolutionary history of individual genes (gene trees) might be topologically
distinct from each other and from the underlying species tree, possibly
confounding phylogenetic analysis. A further complication in practice is that
one has to estimate gene trees from molecular sequences of finite length. We
provide the first full data-requirement analysis of a species tree
reconstruction method that takes into account estimation errors at the gene
level. Under that criterion, we also devise a novel reconstruction algorithm
that provably improves over all previous methods in a regime of interest.

1404.7728	q-bio	q-bio.PE cond-mat.stat-mech math.DS	Trophic coherence determines food-web stability	"  Why are large, complex ecosystems stable? Both theory and simulations of
current models predict the onset of instability with growing size and
complexity, so for decades it has been conjectured that ecosystems must have
some unidentified structural property exempting them from this outcome. We show
that 'trophic coherence' -- a hitherto ignored feature of food webs which
current structural models fail to reproduce -- is a better statistical
predictor of linear stability than size or complexity. Furthermore, we prove
that a maximally coherent network with constant interaction strengths will
always be linearly stable. We also propose a simple model which, by correctly
capturing the trophic coherence of food webs, accurately reproduces their
stability and other basic structural features. Most remarkably, our model shows
that stability can increase with size and complexity. This suggests a key to
May's Paradox, and a range of opportunities and concerns for biodiversity
conservation.

Experimental screens have identified tens of thousands of interactions and
structural biology has provided detailed functional insight for select 3D
protein complexes. An alternative rich source of information about protein
interactions is the evolutionary sequence record. Building on earlier work, we
show that analysis of correlated evolutionary sequence changes across proteins
identifies residues that are close in space with sufficient accuracy to
determine the three-dimensional structure of the protein complexes. We evaluate
prediction performance in blinded tests on 76 complexes of known 3D structure,
predict protein-protein contacts in 32 complexes of unknown structure, and
demonstrate how evolutionary couplings can be used to distinguish between
interacting and non-interacting protein pairs in a large complex. With the
current growth of sequence databases, we expect that the method can be
generalized to genome-wide elucidation of protein-protein interaction networks
and used for interaction predictions at residue resolution.

a therapeuticdrug from a vehicle across the skin (transdermal drug delivery).
In order to study the complete process, a two-phase mathematical model
describing the dynamics of a substance between two coupled media of different
properties and dimensions is presented. A system of partial differential
equations describes the diffusion and the binding/unbinding processes in both
layers. Additional flux continuity at the interface and clearance conditions
into systemic circulation are imposed. An eigenvalue problem with discontinuous
coefficients is solved and an analytical solution is given in the form of an
infinite series expansion. The model points out the role of the diffusion and
reaction parameters, which control the complex transfer mechanism and the drug
kinetics across the two layers. Drug masses are given and their dependence on
the physical parameters is discussed.

1405.2044	q-bio	q-bio.QM q-bio.GN	"Estimation of genetic diversity in viral populations from next
  generation sequencing data with extremely deep coverage"	"  In this paper we propose a method and discuss its computational
implementation as an integrated tool for the analysis of viral genetic
diversity on data generated by high-throughput sequencing. Most methods for
viral diversity estimation proposed so far are intended to take benefit of the
longer reads produced by some NGS platforms in order to estimate a population
of haplotypes. Our goal here is to take advantage of distinct virtues of a
certain kind of NGS platform - the platform SOLiD (Life Technologies) is an
example - that has not received much attention due to the short length of its
reads, which renders haplotype estimation very difficult. However, this kind of
platform has a very low error rate and extremely deep coverage per site and our
method is designed to take advantage of these characteristics. We propose to
measure the populational genetic diversity through a family of multinomial
probability distributions indexed by the sites of the virus genome, each one
representing the populational distribution of the diversity per site. The
implementation of the method focuses on two main optimization strategies: a
read mapping/alignment procedure that aims at the recovery of the maximum
possible number of short-reads; the estimation of the multinomial parameters
through a Bayesian approach, which, unlike simple frequency counting, allows
one to take into account the prior information of the control population within
the inference of a posterior experimental condition and provides a natural way
to separate signal from noise, since it automatically furnishes Bayesian
confidence intervals. The methods described in this paper have been implemented
as an integrated tool called Tanden (Tool for Analysis of Diversity in Viral
Populations).

1405.3226	q-bio	q-bio.QM q-bio.MN	Optimal first-passage time in gene regulatory networks	"  The inherent probabilistic nature of the biochemical reactions, and low copy
number of species can lead to stochasticity in gene expression across identical
cells. As a result, after induction of gene expression, the time at which a
specific protein count is reached is stochastic as well. Therefore events
taking place at a critical protein level will see stochasticity in their
timing. First-passage time (FPT), the time at which a stochastic process hits a
critical threshold, provides a framework to model such events. Here, we
investigate stochasticity in FPT. Particularly, we consider events for which
controlling stochasticity is advantageous. As a possible regulatory mechanism,
we also investigate effect of auto-regulation, where the transcription rate of
gene depends on protein count, on stochasticity of FPT. Specifically, we
investigate for an optimal auto-regulation which minimizes stochasticity in
FPT, given fixed mean FPT and threshold.
  For this purpose, we model the gene expression at a single cell level. We
find analytic formulas for statistical moments of the FPT in terms of model
parameters. Moreover, we examine the gene expression model with
auto-regulation. Interestingly, our results show that the stochasticity in FPT,
for a fixed mean, is minimized when the transcription rate is independent of
protein count. Further, we discuss the results in context of lysis time of an
\textit{E. coli} cell infected by a $\lambda$ phage virus. An optimal lysis
time provides evolutionary advantage to the $\lambda$ phage, suggesting a
possible regulation to minimize its stochasticity. Our results indicate that
there is no auto-regulation of the protein responsible for lysis. Moreover,
congruent to experimental evidences, our analysis predicts that the expression
of the lysis protein should have a small burst size.

prediction, the fitting parameters do not explain the underlying mechanistic
causes of the observed correlations. On the other hand, mathematical models of

  Dissipate the Solar Spectrum"	"  The driving force behind the origin and evolution of life has been the
thermodynamic imperative of increasing the entropy production of the biosphere
through increasing the global solar photon dissipation rate. In the upper
atmosphere of today, oxygen and ozone derived from life processes are
performing the short wavelength UVC and UVB dissipation. On Earth's surface,
water and organic pigments in water facilitate the near UV and visible photon
dissipation. The first organic pigments probably formed, absorbed, and
dissipated at those photochemically active wavelengths in the UVC that could
have reached Earth's surface during the Archean. Proliferation of these
pigments can be understood as an autocatalytic photochemical process obeying
non-equilibrium thermodynamic directives related to increasing solar photon
dissipation rate. Under these directives, organic pigments would have evolved
over time to increase the global photon dissipation rate by; 1) increasing the
ratio of their effective photon cross sections to their physical size, 2)
decreasing their electronic excited state life times, 3) quenching
non-radiative de-excitation channels (e.g. fluorescence), 4) covering ever more
completely the solar spectrum, and 5) dispersing into an ever greater surface
area of Earth. From knowledge of the evolution of the spectrum of G-type stars,
and considering the most probable history of the transparency of Earths
atmosphere, we construct the most probable surface solar spectrum as a function
of time and compare this with the history of molecular absorption maxima
obtained from the available data in the literature. This comparison supports
the thermodynamic dissipation theory for the origin of life, constrains models
for Earth's early atmosphere, and sheds some new light on the origin of
photosynthesis.

  subgraph composition"	"  Clustering is the propensity of nodes that share a common neighbour to be
connected. It is ubiquitous in many networks but poses many modelling
challenges. Clustering typically manifests itself by a higher than expected
frequency of triangles, and this has led to the principle of constructing
networks from such building blocks. This approach has been generalised to
networks being constructed from a set of more exotic subgraphs. As long as
these are fully connected, it is then possible to derive mean-field models that
approximate epidemic dynamics well. However, there are virtually no results for
non-fully connected subgraphs. In this paper, we provide a general and
automated approach to deriving a set of ordinary differential equations, or
mean-field model, that describes, to a high degree of accuracy, the expected
values of system-level quantities, such as the prevalence of infection. Our
approach offers a previously unattainable degree of control over the
arrangement of subgraphs and network characteristics such as classical node
degree, variance and clustering. The combination of these features makes it
possible to generate families of networks with different subgraph compositions
while keeping classical network metrics constant. Using our approach, we show
that higher-order structure realised either through the introduction of loops
of different sizes or by generating clustered networks based on different
subgraphs, leads to significant differences in epidemic dynamics despite
controlling for basic network metrics.

  Resonances in Proteins Exhibiting High Backbone Shift Degeneracy"	"  Assignment of protein backbone resonances is most routinely carried out using
triple resonance three dimensional NMR experiments involving amide 1H and 15N
resonances. However for intrinsically unstructured proteins, alpha-helical
proteins or proteins containing several disordered fragments, the assignment
becomes problematic because of high degree of backbone shift degeneracy. In
this backdrop, a novel reduced dimensionality (RD) experiment
-(5,3)D-hNCO-CANH- is presented to facilitate (and/or to validate) the
sequential backbone resonance assignment in such proteins. The proposed 3D NMR
experiment makes use of the modulated amide 15N chemical shifts (resulting from
the joint sampling along both its indirect dimensions) to resolve the ambiguity
involved in connecting the neighboring amide resonances (i.e. HiNi and
Hi-1Ni-1) for overlapping amide NH peaks. The experiment -encoding 5D spectral
information- leads to a conventional 3D spectrum with significantly reduced
spectral crowding and complexity. The improvisation is based on the fact that
the linear combinations of intra-residue and inter-residue backbone chemical
shifts along both the co-evolved indirect dimensions span a wider spectral
range and produce better peak dispersion than the individual shifts themselves.
Taken together, the experiment -in combination with routine triple resonance 3D
NMR experiments involving backbone amide (1H and 15N) and carbon (13C-alpha and
13C') chemical shifts- will serve as a powerful complementary tool to achieve
the nearly complete assignment of protein backbone resonances in a time
efficient manner. The performance of the experiment and application of the
method have been demonstrated here using a 15.4 kDa size folded protein and a
12 kDa size unfolded protein.

challenges of the field mainly involve processing large numbers of models and
disentangling selection from demography. Several methods address the latter,
either by estimating a neutral model from population structure or by inferring
simultaneously environmental and demographic effects. Here we present
Sam$\beta$ada, an integrated approach to study signatures of local adaptation,
providing rapid processing of whole genome data and enabling assessment of
spatial association using molecular markers. Specifically, candidate loci to
adaptation are identified by automatically assessing genome-environment
associations. In complement, measuring the Local Indicators of Spatial
Association (LISA) for these candidate loci allows to detect whether similar
genotypes tend to gather in space, which constitutes a useful indication of the
possible kinship relationship between individuals. In this paper, we also

with Sam$\beta$ada, BayEnv, LFMM and an outlier method (FDIST approach in
Arlequin) and compare their results. Sam$\beta$ada is an open source software

  Efficacy of Suicidal Altruism"	"  Within the context of evolution, an altruistic act that benefits the
receiving individual at the expense of the acting individual is a puzzling
phenomenon. An extreme form of altruism can be found in colicinogenic E. coli.
These suicidal altruists explode, releasing colicins that kill unrelated
individuals, which are not colicin resistant. By committing suicide, the
altruist makes it more likely that its kin will have less competition. The
benefits of this strategy rely on the number of competitors and kin nearby. If
the organism explodes at an inopportune time, the suicidal act may not harm any
competitors. Communication could enable organisms to act altruistically when
environmental conditions suggest that that strategy would be most beneficial.
Quorum sensing is a form of communication in which bacteria produce a protein
and gauge the amount of that protein around them. Quorum sensing is one means
by which bacteria sense the biotic factors around them and determine when to
produce products, such as antibiotics, that influence competition. Suicidal
altruists could use quorum sensing to determine when exploding is most
beneficial, but it is challenging to study the selective forces at work in
microbes. To address these challenges, we use digital evolution (a form of
experimental evolution that uses self-replicating computer programs as
organisms) to investigate the effects of enabling altruistic organisms to
communicate via quorum sensing. We found that quorum-sensing altruists killed a
greater number of competitors per explosion, winning competitions against
non-communicative altruists. These findings indicate that quorum sensing could
increase the beneficial effect of altruism and the suite of conditions under
which it will evolve.

a phylogenetic tree constructed using pathogen sequences from the epidemic with
information about the host that held the corresponding lineage. In this paper,
we note that this augmentation is equivalent to a correspondence between
transmission trees and partitions of the phylogenetic tree into connected

  an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion on a tree"	"  Diffusion processes on trees are commonly used in evolutionary biology to
model the joint distribution of continuous traits, such as body mass, across
species. Estimating the parameters of such processes from tip values presents
challenges because of the intrinsic correlation between the observations
produced by the shared evolutionary history, thus violating the standard
independence assumption of large-sample theory. For instance Ho and An\'e
\cite{HoAne13} recently proved that the mean (also known in this context as
selection optimum) of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on a tree cannot be
estimated consistently from an increasing number of tip observations if the
tree height is bounded. Here, using a fruitful connection to the so-called
reconstruction problem in probability theory, we study the convergence rate of
parameter estimation in the unbounded height case. For the mean of the process,
we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the consistency of the
maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and establish a phase transition on its
convergence rate in terms of the growth of the tree. In particular we show that
a loss of $\sqrt{n}$-consistency (i.e., the variance of the MLE becomes
$\Omega(n^{-1})$, where $n$ is the number of tips) occurs when the tree growth
is larger than a threshold related to the phase transition of the
reconstruction problem. For the covariance parameters, we give a novel,
efficient estimation method which achieves $\sqrt{n}$-consistency under natural
assumptions on the tree.

(susceptible-infectedsusceptible) epidemic on the network, with a link/contact
rewiring process constrained by spatial proximity. In particular, we assume
that susceptible nodes break links with infected nodes independently of
distance, and reconnect at random to susceptible nodes available within a given
radius. By systematically manipulating this radius we investigate the impact of
rewiring on the structure of the network and characteristics of the epidemic.
We adopt a step-by-step approach whereby we first study the impact of rewiring
on the network structure in the absence of an epidemic, then with nodes
assigned a disease status but without disease dynamics, and finally running
network and epidemic dynamics simultaneously. In the case of no labelling and
no epidemic dynamics, we provide both analytic and semi-analytic formulas for
the value of clustering achieved in the network. Our results also show that the
rewiring radius and the network's initial structure have a pronounced effect on
the endemic equilibrium, with increasingly large rewiring radiuses yielding
smaller disease prevalence.

  networks"	"  The existence of a die-out threshold (different from the classic
disease-invasion one) defining a region of slow extinction of an epidemic has
been proved elsewhere for susceptible-aware-infectious-susceptible models
without awareness decay, through bifurcation analysis. By means of an
equivalent mean-field model defined on regular random networks, we interpret
the dynamics of the system in this region and prove that the existence of
bifurcation for this second epidemic threshold crucially depends on the absence
of awareness decay. We show that the continuum of equilibria that characterizes
the slow die-out dynamics collapses into a unique equilibrium when a constant
rate of awareness decay is assumed, no matter how small, and that the resulting
bifurcation from the disease-free equilibrium is equivalent to that of standard
epidemic models. We illustrate these findings with continuous-time stochastic
simulations on regular random networks with different degrees. Finally, the
behaviour of solutions with and without decay in awareness is compared around
the second epidemic threshold for a small rate of awareness decay.

transcription and translation in which mRNA production is described by a set of
master equations while the dynamics of protein density is governed by a random
differential equation. The coupling between the two processes is given by a
stochastic perturbation whose statistics satisfies the master equations. In
this approach, from the knowledge of the analytical time dependent distribution
of mRNA number, we are able to calculate the dynamics of the probability
density of the protein population.

  landscapes"	"  We consider the adaptation dynamics of an asexual population that walks
uphill on a rugged fitness landscape which is endowed with large number of
local fitness peaks. We work in a parameter regime where only those mutants
that are single mutation away are accessible, as a result of which the
population eventually gets trapped at a local fitness maximum and the adaptive
walk terminates. We study how the number of adaptive steps taken by the
population before reaching a local fitness peak depends on the initial fitness
of the population, the extreme value distribution of the beneficial mutations
and correlations amongst the fitnesses. Assuming that the relative fitness
difference between successive steps is small, we analytically calculate the
average walk length for both uncorrelated and correlated fitnesses in all
extreme value domains for a given initial fitness. We present numerical results
for the model where the fitness differences can be large, and find that the
walk length behavior differs from that in the former model in the Fr\'echet
domain of extreme value theory. We also discuss the relevance of our results to
microbial experiments.

  Linear in Rates Lyapunov Functions"	"  Piecewise-Linear in Rates (PWLR) Lyapunov functions are introduced for a
class of Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs). In addition to their simple
structure, these functions are robust with respect to arbitrary monotone
reaction rates, of which mass-action is a special case. The existence of such
functions ensures the convergence of trajectories towards equilibria, and
guarantee their asymptotic stability with respect to the corresponding
stoichiometric compatibility class. We give the definition of these Lyapunov
functions, prove their basic properties, and provide algorithms for
constructing them. Examples are provided, relationship with consensus dynamics
are discussed, and future directions are elaborated.

1407.0867	q-bio	q-bio.QM	"Bystander effects and their implications for clinical radiation therapy:
  Insights from multiscale in silico experiments"	"  Radiotherapy is a commonly used treatment for cancer and is usually given in
varying doses. At low radiation doses relatively few cells die as a direct
response to radiation but secondary radiation effects such as DNA mutation or
bystander effects affect many cells. Consequently it is at low radiation levels
where an understanding of bystander effects is essential in designing novel
therapies with superior clinical outcomes. In this article, we use a hybrid
multiscale mathematical model to study the direct effects of radiation as well
as radiation-induced bystander effects on both tumour cells and normal cells.
We show that bystander responses may play a major role in mediating radiation
damage to cells at low-doses of radiotherapy, doing more damage than that due
to direct radiation. The survival curves derived from our computational
simulations showed an area of hyper-radiosensitivity at low-doses that are not
obtained using a traditional radiobiological model.

1407.1627	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Purifying selection, drift and reversible mutation with arbitrarily high
  mutation rates"	"  Some species exhibit very high levels of DNA sequence variability; there is
also evidence for the existence of heritable epigenetic variants that
experience state changes at a much higher rate than sequence variants. In both
cases, the resulting high diversity levels within a population (hyperdiversity)
mean that standard population genetics methods are not trustworthy. We analyze
a population genetics model that incorporates purifying selection, reversible
mutations and genetic drift, assuming a stationary population size. We derive
analytical results for both population parameters and sample statistics, and
discuss their implications for studies of natural genetic and epigenetic
variation. In particular, we find that (1) many more intermediate frequency
variants are expected than under standard models, even with moderately strong
purifying selection (2) rates of evolution under purifying selection may be
close to, or even exceed, neutral rates. These findings are related to
empirical studies of sequence and epigenetic variation.

  tension model for cortex folding"	"  We model the elasticity of the cerebral cortex as a layered material with
bending energy along the layers and elastic energy between them in both planar
and polar geometries. The cortex is also subjected to axons pulling from the
underlying white matter. Above a critical threshold force, a ""flat"" cortex
configuration becomes unstable and periodic unduluations emerge, i.e. a
buckling instability occurs. These undulations may indeed initiate folds in the
cortex. We identify analytically the critical force and the critical wavelength
of the undulations. Both quantities are physiologically relevant values. Our
model is a revised version of the axonal tension model for cortex folding, with
our version taking into account the layered structure of the cortex. Moreover,
our model draws a connection with another competing model for cortex folding,
namely the differential growth-induced buckling model. For the polar geometry,
we study the relationship between brain size and the critical force and
wavelength to understand why small mice brains exhibit no folds, while larger
human brains do, for example. Finally, an estimate of the bending rigidity
constant for the cortex can be made based on the critical wavelength.

1407.5019	q-bio	cond-mat.dis-nn physics.soc-ph q-bio.NC	From Dyson to Hopfield: Processing on hierarchical networks	"  We consider statistical-mechanical models for spin systems built on
hierarchical structures, which provide a simple example of non-mean-field
framework. We show that the coupling decay with spin distance can give rise to
peculiar features and phase diagrams much richer that their mean-field
counterpart. In particular, we consider the Dyson model, mimicking
ferromagnetism in lattices, and we prove the existence of a number of
meta-stabilities, beyond the ordered state, which get stable in the
thermodynamic limit. Such a feature is retained when the hierarchical structure
is coupled with the Hebb rule for learning, hence mimicking the modular
architecture of neurons, and gives rise to an associative network able to
perform both as a serial processor as well as a parallel processor, depending
crucially on the external stimuli and on the rate of interaction decay with
distance; however, those emergent multitasking features reduce the network
capacity with respect to the mean-field counterpart. The analysis is
accomplished through statistical mechanics, graph theory, signal-to-noise
technique and numerical simulations in full consistency. Our results shed light
on the biological complexity shown by real networks, and suggest future
directions for understanding more realistic models.

1407.5105	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Dynamic network drivers of seizure generation, propagation and
  termination in human epilepsy"	"  Drug-resistant epilepsy is traditionally characterized by pathologic cortical
tissue comprised of seizure-initiating `foci'. These `foci' are thought to be
embedded within an epileptic network whose functional architecture dynamically
reorganizes during seizures through synchronous and asynchronous
neurophysiologic processes. Critical to understanding these dynamics is
identifying the synchronous connections that link foci to surrounding tissue
and investigating how these connections facilitate seizure generation and
termination. We use intracranial recordings from neocortical epilepsy patients
undergoing pre-surgical evaluation to analyze functional connectivity before
and during seizures. We develop and apply a novel technique to track network
reconfiguration in time and to parse these reconfiguration dynamics into
distinct seizure states, each characterized by unique patterns of network
connections that differ in their strength and topography. Our approach suggests
that seizures are generated when the synchronous relationships that isolate
seizure `foci' from the surrounding epileptic network are broken down. As
seizures progress, foci reappear as isolated subnetworks, marking a shift in
network state that may aid seizure termination. Collectively, our observations
have important theoretical implications for understanding the spatial
involvement of distributed cortical structures in the dynamics of seizure
generation, propagation and termination, and have practical significance in
determining which circuits to modulate with implantable devices.

achieved by analysing and modelling weekly laboratory confirmed cases of
influenza A and B from 138 countries between January 2006 and May 2014. The
data were obtained from FluNet, the surveillance network compiled by the the
World Health Organization. We report a pattern of {\it skip-and-resurgence}
behavior between the years 2011 and 2013 for influenza H1N1/09, the strain
responsible for the 2009 pandemic, in Europe and Eastern Asia. In particular,
the expected H1N1/09 epidemic outbreak in 2011 failed to occur (or""skipped"") in
many countries across the globe, although an outbreak occurred in the following
year. We also report a pattern of {\it well-synchronized} 2010 winter wave of
H1N1/09 in the Northern Hemisphere countries, and a pattern of replacement of
strain H1N1/77 by H1N1/09 between the 2009 and 2012 influenza seasons. Using
both a statistical and a mechanistic mathematical model, and through fitting
the data of 108 countries (108 countries in a statistical model and 10 large
populations with a mechanistic model), we discuss the mechanisms that are
likely to generate these events taking into account the role of multi-strain
dynamics. A basic understanding of these patterns has important public health
implications and scientific significance.

1407.6117	q-bio	q-bio.MN	"Relative Stability of Network States in Boolean Network Models of Gene
  Regulation in Development"	"  Progress in cell type reprogramming has revived the interest in Waddington's
concept of the epigenetic landscape. Recently researchers developed the
quasi-potential theory to represent the Waddington's landscape. The
Quasi-potential U(x), derived from interactions in the gene regulatory network
(GRN) of a cell, quantifies the relative stability of network states, which
determine the effort required for state transitions in a multi-stable dynamical
system. However, quasi-potential landscapes, originally developed for
continuous systems, are not suitable for discrete-valued networks which are
important tools to study complex systems. In this paper, we provide a framework
to quantify the landscape for discrete Boolean networks (BNs). We apply our
framework to study pancreas cell differentiation where an ensemble of BN models
is considered based on the structure of a minimal GRN for pancreas development.
We impose biologically motivated structural constraints (corresponding to
specific type of Boolean functions) and dynamical constraints (corresponding to
stable attractor states) to limit the space of BN models for pancreas
development. In addition, we enforce a novel functional constraint
corresponding to the relative ordering of attractor states in BN models to
restrict the space of BN models to the biological relevant class. We find that
BNs with canalyzing/sign-compatible Boolean functions best capture the dynamics
of pancreas cell differentiation. This framework can also determine the genes'
influence on cell state transitions, and thus can facilitate the rational
design of cell reprogramming protocols.

1407.6598	q-bio	q-bio.PE cs.SI physics.soc-ph	"The basic reproduction number as a predictor for epidemic outbreaks in
  temporal networks"	"  The basic reproduction number R0 -- the number of individuals directly
infected by an infectious person in an otherwise susceptible population -- is
arguably the most widely used estimator of how severe an epidemic outbreak can
be. This severity can be more directly measured as the fraction people infected
once the outbreak is over, {\Omega}. In traditional mathematical epidemiology
and common formulations of static network epidemiology, there is a
deterministic relationship between R0 and {\Omega}. However, if one considers
disease spreading on a temporal contact network -- where one knows when
contacts happen, not only between whom -- then larger R0 does not necessarily
imply larger {\Omega}. In this paper, we numerically investigate the
relationship between R0 and {\Omega} for a set of empirical temporal networks
of human contacts. Among 31 explanatory descriptors of temporal network
structure, we identify those that make R0 an imperfect predictor of {\Omega}.
We find that descriptors related to both temporal and topological aspects
affect the relationship between R0 and {\Omega}, but in different ways.

survival and coexistence of cooperators with defectors in well-mixed
populations. Here we examine the same model on a scale-free network. A
prisoner's dilemma game on a scale-free network has shown coexistence of
cooperators and defectors for the entire range of parameters. Our results show
that by introducing the network to the limited resources model, the
cooperator-dominated region in the parameter space expands comparing to the
results of well-mixed population and the coexistence region becomes narrower.
The effect of scale-free network is therefore interpreted as improving the
cooperation in the population and reducing the coexistence.

1407.6888	q-bio	q-bio.PE cond-mat.dis-nn physics.bio-ph	How a well-adapted immune system is organized	"  The repertoire of lymphocyte receptors in the adaptive immune system protects
organisms from diverse pathogens. A well-adapted repertoire should be tuned to
the pathogenic environment to reduce the cost of infections. We develop a
general framework for predicting the optimal repertoire that minimizes the cost
of infections contracted from a given distribution of pathogens. The theory
predicts that the immune system will have more receptors for rare antigens than
expected from the frequency of encounters; individuals exposed to the same
infections will have sparse repertoires that are largely different, but
nevertheless exploit cross-reactivity to provide the same coverage of antigens;
and the optimal repertoires can be reached via the dynamics of competitive
binding of antigens by receptors, and selective amplification of stimulated
receptors. Our results follow from a tension between the statistics of pathogen
detection, which favor a broader receptor distribution, and the effects of
cross-reactivity, which tend to concentrate the optimal repertoire onto a few
highly abundant clones. Our predictions can be tested in high throughput
surveys of receptor and pathogen diversity.

increasing speeds of DNA sample collection, preparation, and sequencing. One
instrument can produce over 600 Gb of genetic sequence data in a single run.
This creates new opportunities to efficiently handle the increasing workload.
We propose a new method of fast genetic sequence analysis using the Dynamic
Distributed Dimensional Data Model (D4M) - an associative array environment for
MATLAB developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Based on mathematical and
statistical properties, the method leverages big data techniques and the
implementation of an Apache Acculumo database to accelerate computations
one-hundred fold over other methods. Comparisons of the D4M method with the
current gold-standard for sequence analysis, BLAST, show the two are comparable
in the alignments they find. This paper will present an overview of the D4M
genetic sequence algorithm and statistical comparisons with BLAST.

1407.7135	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Zipf's law arises naturally in structured, high-dimensional data	"  Zipf's law, which states that the probability of an observation is inversely
proportional to its rank, has been observed in many domains. While there are
models that explain Zipf's law in each of them, those explanations are
typically domain specific. Recently, methods from statistical physics were used
to show that a fairly broad class of models does provide a general explanation
of Zipf's law. This explanation rests on the observation that real world data
is often generated from underlying causes, known as latent variables. Those
latent variables mix together multiple models that do not obey Zipf's law,
giving a model that does. Here we extend that work both theoretically and
empirically. Theoretically, we provide a far simpler and more intuitive
explanation of Zipf's law, which at the same time considerably extends the
class of models to which this explanation can apply. Furthermore, we also give
methods for verifying whether this explanation applies to a particular dataset.
Empirically, these advances allowed us extend this explanation to important
classes of data, including word frequencies (the first domain in which Zipf's
law was discovered), data with variable sequence length, and multi-neuron
spiking activity.

  climate change"	"  We mapped current and future temperature suitability for malaria transmission
in Africa using a published model that incorporates nonlinear physiological
responses to temperature of the mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae and the
malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We found that a larger area of Africa
currently experiences the ideal temperature for transmission than previously
supposed. Under future climate projections, we predicted a modest increase in
the overall area suitable for malaria transmission, but a net decrease in the
most suitable area. Combined with population density projections, our maps
suggest that areas with temperatures suitable for year-round, highest risk
transmission will shift from coastal West Africa to the Albertine Rift between
Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, while areas with seasonal transmission
suitability will shift toward sub-Saharan coastal areas. Mapping temperature
suitability places important bounds on malaria transmissibility and, along with
local level demographic, socioeconomic, and ecological factors, can indicate
where resources may be best spent on malaria control.

1407.7663	q-bio	cs.NE q-bio.PE	Level-based Analysis of Genetic Algorithms and other Search Processes	"  Understanding how the time-complexity of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) depend
on their parameter settings and characteristics of fitness landscapes is a
fundamental problem in evolutionary computation. Most rigorous results were
derived using a handful of key analytic techniques, including drift analysis.
However, since few of these techniques apply effortlessly to population-based
EAs, most time-complexity results concern simplified EAs, such as the (1+1) EA.
  This paper describes the level-based theorem, a new technique tailored to
population-based processes. It applies to any non-elitist process where
offspring are sampled independently from a distribution depending only on the
current population. Given conditions on this distribution, our technique
provides upper bounds on the expected time until the process reaches a target
state.
  We demonstrate the technique on several pseudo-Boolean functions, the sorting
problem, and approximation of optimal solutions in combinatorial optimisation.
The conditions of the theorem are often straightforward to verify, even for
Genetic Algorithms and Estimation of Distribution Algorithms which were
considered highly non-trivial to analyse. Finally, we prove that the theorem is
nearly optimal for the processes considered. Given the information the theorem
requires about the process, a much tighter bound cannot be proved.

1408.0298	q-bio	cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.PE	Two-strain competition in quasi-neutral stochastic disease dynamics	"  We develop a new perturbation method for studying quasi-neutral competition
in a broad class of stochastic competition models, and apply it to the analysis
of fixation of competing strains in two epidemic models. The first model is a
two-strain generalization of the stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible
(SIS) model. Here we extend previous results due to Parsons and Quince (2007),
Parsons et al (2008) and Lin, Kim and Doering (2012). The second model, a
two-strain generalization of the stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered
(SIR) model with population turnover, has not been studied previously. In each
of the two models, when the basic reproduction numbers of the two strains are
identical, a system with an infinite population size approaches a point on the
deterministic coexistence line (CL): a straight line of fixed points in the
phase space of sub-population sizes. Shot noise drives one of the strain
populations to fixation, and the other to extinction, on a time scale
proportional to the total population size. Our perturbation method explicitly
tracks the dynamics of the probability distribution of the sub-populations in
the vicinity of the CL. We argue that, whereas the slow strain has a
competitive advantage for mathematically ""typical"" initial conditions, it is
the fast strain that is more likely to win in the important situation when a
few infectives of both strains are introduced into a susceptible population.

  dengue, and influenza"	"  Transmission rates are key in understanding the spread of infectious
diseases. Using the framework of compartmental models, we introduce a simple
method that enables us to reconstruct time series of transmission rates
directly from incidence or disease-related mortality data. The reconstruction
exploits differential equations, which model the time evolution of infective
stages and strains. Being sensitive to initial values, the method produces
asymptotically correct solutions. The computations are fast, with time
complexity being quadratic. We apply the reconstruction to data of measles
(England and Wales, 1948-67), dengue (Thailand, 1982-99), and influenza (U.S.,
1910-27). The Measles example offers comparison with earlier work. Here we
re-investigate reporting corrections, include and exclude demographic
information. The dengue example deals with the failure of vector-control
measures in reducing dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in Thailand. Two competing
mechanisms have been held responsible: strain interaction and demographic
transitions. Our reconstruction reveals that both explanations are possible,
showing that the increase in DHF cases is consistent with decreasing
transmission rates resulting from reduced vector counts. The flu example
focuses on the 1918/19 pandemic, examining the transmission rate evolution for
an invading strain. Our analysis indicates that the pandemic strain could have
circulated in the population for many months before the pandemic was initiated
by an event of highly increased transmission.

reaction kinetics (the so called {\em enzyme based logic}) which code for
two-inputs logic gates and mimic the stochastic AND (and NAND) as well as the
stochastic OR (and NOR). This accomplishment, together with the already-known
single-input gates (performing as YES and NOT), provides a logic base and paves
the way to the development of powerful biotechnological devices. The
investigation of this field would enormously benefit from a self-consistent,

mechanical description of the Monod-Wyman-Changeaux allosteric model for both
single and double ligand systems, with the purpose of exploring their practical
capabilities to express logical operators and/or perform logical operations.
Mixing statistical mechanics with logics, and quantitatively our findings with
the available biochemical data, we successfully revise the concept of
cooperativity (and anti-cooperativity) for allosteric systems, with particular
emphasis on its computational capabilities, the related ranges and scaling of
the involved parameters and its differences with classical cooperativity (and
anti-cooperativity).

1408.2761	q-bio	q-bio.PE q-bio.BM	"Strong Selection Significantly Increases Epistatic Interactions in the
  Long-Term Evolution of a Protein"	"  Epistatic interactions between residues determine a protein's adaptability
and shape its evolutionary trajectory. When a protein experiences a changed
environment, it is under strong selection to find a peak in the new fitness
landscape. It has been shown that strong selection increases epistatic
interactions as well as the ruggedness of the fitness landscape, but little is
known about how the epistatic interactions change under selection in the
long-term evolution of a protein. Here we analyze the evolution of epistasis in
the protease of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) using protease
sequences collected for almost a decade from both treated and untreated
patients, to understand how epistasis changes and how those changes impact the
long-term evolvability of a protein. We use an information-theoretic proxy for
epistasis that quantifies the co-variation between sites, and show that
positive information is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition that detects
epistasis in most cases. We analyze the ""fossils"" of the evolutionary
trajectories of the protein contained in the sequence data, and show that
epistasis continues to enrich under strong selection, but not for proteins
whose environment is unchanged. The increase in epistasis compensates for the
information loss due to sequence variability brought about by treatment, and
facilitates adaptation in the increasingly rugged fitness landscape of
treatment. While epistasis is thought to enhance evolvability via
valley-crossing early-on in adaptation, it can hinder adaptation later when the
landscape has turned rugged. However, we find no evidence that the HIV-1
protease has reached its potential for evolution after 9 years of adapting to a
drug environment that itself is constantly changing.

the retinal population. Here we recorded a large population of ganglion cells
in a dense patch of salamander and guinea pig retinas while displaying a bar
moving diffusively. We show that the bar position can be reconstructed from
retinal activity with a precision in the hyperacuity regime using a linear
decoder acting on 100+ cells. The classical view would have suggested that the
firing rates of the cells form a moving hill of activity tracking the bar's
position. Instead, we found that ganglion cells fired sparsely over an area
much larger than predicted by their receptive fields, so that the neural image
did not track the bar. This highly redundant organization allows for diverse
collections of ganglion cells to represent high-accuracy motion information in
a form easily read out by downstream neural circuits.

physiological functions. The aim of this work is on one hand to propose a fully
stochastic and discrete model describing the main characteristics of a multiple
channel system. The movement of the ions is coupled, as usual, with a Poisson
equation for the electrical field; we have considered, in addition, the
influence of exclusion forces. On the other hand, we have discussed about the
nondimensionalization of the stochastic system by using real physical
parameters, all supported by numerical simulations. The specific features of
both cases of micro- and nanochannels have been taken in due consideration with
particular attention to the latter case in order to show that it is necessary
to consider a discrete and stochastic model for ions movement inside the
channels.

  during cancer"	"  Theoretical reasoning suggests that human cancer may result from knocking
down the genetic constraints evolved for maintenance of the metazoan
multicellularity, which, however, requires a critical test. Using
xenograft-based experimental evolution we characterized for the first time the
full life history from initiation to metastasis of a tumor at the genomic and
transcriptomic levels, and observed metastasis-driving positive selection for
generally loss-of-function mutations on a set of multicellularity-related
genes, which is further supported by large-scale exome data of clinical tumor
samples. Subsequent expression analysis revealed mainly expression
down-regulation of multicellularity-related genes, which form an evolving
expression profile approaching that of embryonic stem cells, the cell type with
the most characteristics of unicellular life. The theoretical conjecture
predicts that genes born at the emergence of metazoan multicellularity tend to
be cancer drivers, which we validated using a rigorous phylostratigraphy
analysis on the birth rate of genes annotated by Cancer Gene Census. Also, the
number of loss-of-function tumor suppressors often predominates over activated
oncogenes in a typical tumor of human patients. These data collectively suggest
that, different from typical organismal evolution in which gain of new genes is
the mainstream, cancer represents a loss-of-function-driven degenerative
evolution back to the unicellular ground state. This cancer evolution model may
explain the enormous tumoral genetic heterogeneity in the clinic, underlie how
distant-organ metastases originate in primary tumors despite distinct
environmental requirements, and hold implications for designing effective
cancer therapy.

  outbreak in West Africa"	"  The 2014 Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa is the largest outbreak
of the genus Ebolavirus to date. To better understand the spread of infection
in the affected countries, it is crucial to know the number of secondary cases
generated by an infected index case in the absence and presence of control
measures, i.e., the basic and effective reproduction number. In this study, I
describe the EBOV epidemic using an SEIR
(susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model and fit the model to the most
recent reported data of infected cases and deaths in Guinea, Sierra Leone and
Liberia. The maximum likelihood estimates of the basic reproduction number are
1.51 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50-1.52) for Guinea, 2.53 (95% CI:
2.41-2.67) for Sierra Leone and 1.59 (95% CI: 1.57-1.60) for Liberia. The model
indicates that in Guinea and Sierra Leone the effective reproduction number

  category learning and development of automaticity"	"  Recent work has shown that multimodal association areas-including frontal,
temporal and parietal cortex-are focal points of functional network
reconfiguration during human learning and performance of cognitive tasks. On
the other hand, neurocomputational theories of category learning suggest that
the basal ganglia and related subcortical structures are focal points of
functional network reconfiguration during early learning of some categorization
tasks, but become less so with the development of automatic categorization
performance. Using a combination of network science and multilevel regression,
we explore how changes in the connectivity of small brain regions can predict
behavioral changes during training in a visual categorization task. We find
that initial category learning, as indexed by changes in accuracy, is predicted
by increasingly efficient integrative processing in subcortical areas, with
higher functional specialization, more efficient integration across modules,
but a lower cost in terms of redundancy of information processing. The
development of automaticity, as indexed by changes in the speed of correct
responses, was predicted by lower clustering (particularly in subcortical
areas), higher strength (highest in cortical areas) and higher betweenness
centrality. By combining neurocomputational theories and network scientific
methods, these results synthesize the dissociative roles of multimodal
association areas and subcortical structures in the development of automaticity
during category learning.

1408.5036	q-bio	math.PR q-bio.PE	The stochastic encounter-mating model	"  We propose a new model of permanent monogamous pair formation in zoological
populations with multiple types of females and males. According to this model,
animals randomly encounter members of the opposite sex at their so-called
firing times to form temporary pairs which then become permanent if mating
happens. Given the distributions of the firing times and the mating preferences
upon encounter, we analyze the contingency table of permanent pair types in
three cases: (i) definite mating upon encounter; (ii) Poisson firing times; and
(iii) Bernoulli firing times. In the first case, the contingency table has a
multiple hypergeometric distribution which implies panmixia. The other two
cases generalize the encounter-mating models of Gimelfarb (1988) who gives
conditions that he conjectures to be sufficient for panmixia. We formulate
adaptations of his conditions and prove that they not only characterize
panmixia but also allow us to reduce the model to the first case by changing
its underlying parameters. Finally, when there are only two types of females
and males, we provide a full characterization of panmixia, homogamy and
heterogamy.

different organisms to study their phylogeny. The structure of metabolic
networks also reveal valuable insights into metabolic capacity of species as
well as into the habitats where they have evolved. We constructed metabolic
networks of 79 fully sequenced organisms and compared their architectures. We
used spectral density of normalized Laplacian matrix for comparing the
structure of networks. The eigenvalues of this matrix reflect not only the
global architecture of a network but also the local topologies that are
produced by different graph evolutionary processes like motif duplication or
joining. A divergence measure on spectral densities is used to quantify the
distances between various metabolic networks, and a split network is
constructed to analyze the phylogeny from these distances. In our analysis, we
focus on the species, which belong to different classes, but appear more
related to each other in the phylogeny. We tried to explore whether they have
evolved under similar environmental conditions or have similar life histories.
With this focus, we have obtained interesting insights into the phylogenetic
commonality between different organisms.

  Rabbit Prion Protein"	"  Prion diseases are invariably fatal and highly infectious neurodegenerative
diseases that affect a wide variety of mammalian species such as sheep and
goats, cattle, deer, elks, humans and mice etc., but rabbits have a low
susceptibility to be infected by prion diseases with respect to other species.
The stability of rabbit prion protein is due to its highly ordered
{\beta}2-{\alpha}2 loop (PLoS One 5(10) e13273 (2010); Journal of Biological
Chemistry 285(41) 31682-31693 (2010)) and a hydrophobic staple helix-capping
motif (PNAS 107(46) 19808-19813 (2010); PLoS One 8 (5) e63047 (2013)). The
{\beta}2-{\alpha}2 loop and the tail of Helix 3 it interacts with have been a
focus in prion protein structure studies. For this loop we found a salt bridge
linkage ASP177-ARG163 (O-N) (Journal of Theoretical Biology 342 (7 February
2014) 70-82 (2014)). Some scientists said on the 2FJ3.pdb NMR file of the
rabbit prion protein, the distance of ASP177-ARG163 (O-N) gives the salt bridge
of about 10 {\AA} which is nearly null in terms of energy and such a salt
bridge is not observed in their work. But, from the 3O79.pdb X-ray file of the
rabbit prion protein, we can clearly observe this salt bridge. This article
analyses the NMR and X-ray structures and gives an answer to the above
question: the salt bridge presents at pH 6.5 in the X-ray structure is simply
gone at pH 4.5 in the NMR structure is simply due to the different pH values
that impact electrostatics at the salt bridge and hence also impact the
structures. Moreover, some molecular dynamics simulation results of the X-ray
structure are reported in this article to reveal the secrets of the structural
stability of rabbit prion protein.

  Approach"	"  Being able to design genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) to achieve a desired
cellular function is one of the main goals of synthetic biology. However,
determining minimal GRNs that produce desired time-series behaviors is
non-trivial. In this paper, we propose a 'top-down' approach to evolving small
GRNs and then use these to recursively boot-strap the identification of larger,
more complex, modular GRNs. We start with relatively dense GRNs and then use
differential evolution (DE) to evolve interaction coefficients. When the target
dynamical behavior is found embedded in a dense GRN, we narrow the focus of the
search and begin aggressively pruning out excess interactions at the end of
each generation. We first show that the method can quickly rediscover known
small GRNs for a toggle switch and an oscillatory circuit. Next we include
these GRNs as non-evolvable subnetworks in the subsequent evolution of more
complex, modular GRNs. Successful solutions found in canonical DE where we
truncated small interactions to zero, with or without an interaction penalty
term, invariably contained many excess interactions. In contrast, by
incorporating aggressive pruning and the penalty term, the DE was able to find
minimal or nearly minimal GRNs in all test problems.

focuses on study of complex interactions in a biological system, such as gene
regulatory networks. The discovery of gene regulatory networks leads to a wide
range of applications, such as pathways related to a disease that can unveil in
what way the disease acts and provide novel tentative drug targets. In
addition, the development of biological models from discovered networks or
pathways can help to predict the responses to disease and can be much useful
for the novel drug development and treatments. The inference of regulatory
networks from biological data is still in its infancy stage. This paper
proposes a recurrent neural network (RNN) based gene regulatory network (GRN)
model hybridized with generalized extended Kalman filter for weight update in
backpropagation through time training algorithm. The RNN is a complex neural
network that gives a better settlement between the biological closeness and
mathematical flexibility to model GRN. The RNN is able to capture complex,
non-linear and dynamic relationship among variables. Gene expression data are
inherently noisy and Kalman filter performs well for estimation even in noisy
data. Hence, non-linear version of Kalman filter, i.e., generalized extended
Kalman filter has been applied for weight update during network training. The
developed model has been applied on DNA SOS repair network, IRMA network, and
two synthetic networks from DREAM Challenge. We compared our results with other
state-of-the-art techniques that show superiority of our model. Further, 5%
Gaussian noise has been added in the dataset and result of the proposed model
shows negligible effect of noise on the results.

1408.5461	q-bio	q-bio.PE	A genomic map of the effects of linked selection in Drosophila	"  Natural selection at one site shapes patterns of genetic variation at linked
sites. Quantifying the effects of 'linked selection' on levels of genetic
diversity is key to making reliable inference about demography, building a null
model in scans for targets of adaptation, and learning about the dynamics of
natural selection. Here, we introduce the first method that jointly infers
parameters of distinct modes of linked selection, notably background selection
and selective sweeps, from genome-wide diversity data, functional annotations
and genetic maps. The central idea is to calculate the probability that a
neutral site is polymorphic given local annotations, substitution patterns, and
recombination rates. Information is then combined across sites and samples
using composite likelihood in order to estimate genome-wide parameters of
distinct modes of selection. In addition to parameter estimation, this approach
yields a map of the expected neutral diversity levels along the genome. To
illustrate the utility of our approach, we apply it to genome-wide resequencing
data from 125 lines in Drosophila melanogaster and reliably predict diversity
levels at the 1Mb scale. Our results corroborate estimates of a high fraction
of beneficial substitutions in proteins and untranslated regions (UTR). They
allow us to distinguish between the contribution of sweeps and other modes of
selection around amino acid substitutions and to uncover evidence for pervasive
sweeps in untranslated regions (UTRs). Our inference further suggests a
substantial effect of linked selection from non-classic sweeps. More generally,
we demonstrate that linked selection has had a larger effect in reducing
diversity levels and increasing their variance in D. melanogaster than
previously appreciated.

1408.6501	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Fixation in large populations: a continuous view of a discrete problem	"  We study fixation in large, but finite, populations with two types, and
dynamics governed by birth-death processes. By considering a restricted class
of such processes, we derive a continuous approximation for the probability of
fixation that is valid beyond the weak-selection (WS) limit. From the
continuous approximations, we then obtain asymptotic approximations for
evolutionary dynamics with at most one equilibrium, in the selection-driven
regime, that does not preclude a weak-selection regime. As an application, we
study the fixation pattern when the infinite population limit has an interior
Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS): (i) we show that the fixation pattern for
the Hawk and Dove game satisfies what we term the one-half law: if the
Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS) is outside a small interval around
$\sfrac{1}{2}$, the fixation is of dominance type; (ii) we also show that,
outside of the weak-selection regime, the long-term dynamics of large
populations can have very little resemblance to the infinite population case;
in addition, we also present results for the case of two equilibria. Finally,
we present continuous restatements valid for large populations of two classical
concepts naturally defined in the discrete case: (i) the definition of an
$\textsc{ESS}_N$ strategy; (ii) the definition of a risk-dominant strategy. We
then present two applications of these restatements: (i) we obtain an
asymptotic definition valid in the quasi-neutral regime that recovers both the
one-third law under linear fitness and the generalised one-third law for
$d$-player games; (ii) we extend the ideas behind the (generalised) one-third
law outside the quasi-neutral regime and, as a generalisation, we introduce the
concept of critical-frequency; (iii) we recover the classification of
risk-dominant strategies for $d$-player games.

1408.6896	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Neuronal control of locomotor handedness in Drosophila	"  Handedness in humans - better performance using either the left or right hand
- is personally familiar, moderately heritable, and regulated by many genes,
including those involved in general body symmetry. But behavioral handedness,
i.e. lateralization, is a multifaceted phenomenon. For example, people display
clockwise or counter-clockwise biases in their walking behavior that is
uncorrelated to their hand dominance, and lateralized behavioral biases have
been shown in species as disparate as mice (paw usage), octopi (eye usage), and
tortoises (side rolled on during righting). However, the mechanisms by which
asymmetries are instilled in behavior are unknown, and a system for studying
behavioral handedness in a genetically tractable model system is needed. Here
we show that Drosophila melanogaster flies exhibit striking variability in
their left-right choice behavior during locomotion. Very strongly biased
""left-handed"" and ""right-handed"" individuals are common in every line assayed.
The handedness of an individual persists for its lifetime, but is not passed on
to progeny, suggesting that mechanisms other than genetics determine individual
handedness. We use the Drosophila transgenic toolkit to map a specific set of
neurons within the central complex that regulates the strength of behavioral
handedness within a line. These findings give insights into choice behaviors
and laterality in a simple model organism, and demonstrate that individuals
from isogenic populations reared under experimentally identical conditions
nevertheless display idiosyncratic behaviors.

structural and temporal properties of human contact networks. This universality
suggests that some basic mechanisms may be responsible for the unfolding of
human interactions in the physical space. Here we discuss a simple model that
reproduces the empirical distributions for the individual, group and collective

randomly in a two-dimensional space and tend to stop when meeting ""attractive""
peers, and reproduces accurately the empirical distributions.

1409.0675	q-bio	q-bio.NC math.DG	"Affine differential geometry and smoothness maximization as tools for
  identifying geometric movement primitives"	"  Neuroscientific studies of drawing-like movements usually analyze neural
representation of either geometric (eg. direction, shape) or temporal (eg.
speed) features of trajectories rather than trajectory's representation as a
whole. This work is about empirically supported mathematical ideas behind
splitting and merging geometric and temporal features which characterize
biological movements. Movement primitives supposedly facilitate the efficiency
of movements' representation in the brain and comply with different criteria
for biological movements, among them kinematic smoothness and geometric
constraint. Criterion for trajectories' maximal smoothness of arbitrary order
$n$ is employed, $n = 3$ is the case of the minimum-jerk model. I derive a
class of differential equations obeyed by movement paths for which $n$-th order
maximally smooth trajectories have constant rate of accumulating geometric
measurement along the drawn path. Constant rate of accumulating equi-affine arc
corresponds to compliance with the two-thirds power-law model. Geometric
measurement is invariant under a class of geometric transformations and may be
chosen to be an arc in certain geometry. Equations' solutions presumably serve
as candidates for geometric movement primitives. The derived class of
differential equations consists of two parts. The first part is identical for
all geometric parameterizations of the path. The second part enforces
consistency with desired (geometric) parametrization of curves on solutions of
the first part. Equations in different geometries in plane and in space and
their known solutions are presented. Connection between geometric invariance,
motion smoothness, compositionality and performance of the compromised motor
control system is discussed. The derived class of differential equations is a
novel tool for discovering candidates for geometric movement primitives.

instead we must rely on simulation based methods. Unfortunately, drawing exact
realisations, results in simulating every reaction that occurs. This will
preclude the use of exact simulators for models of any realistic size and so
approximate algorithms become important. In this paper we describe a general
framework for assessing the accuracy of the linear noise and two moment
approximations. By constructing an efficient space filling design over the
parameter region of interest, we present a number of useful diagnostic tools
that aids modellers in assessing whether the approximation is suitable. In
particular, we leverage the normality assumption of the linear noise and moment
closure approximations.

1409.1838	q-bio	q-bio.QM q-bio.PE	"An adaptive multi-level simulation algorithm for stochastic biological
  systems"	"  Discrete-state, continuous-time Markov models are widely used in the modeling
of biochemical reaction networks. Their complexity often precludes analytic
solution, and we rely on stochastic simulation algorithms to estimate system
statistics. The Gillespie algorithm is exact, but computationally costly as it
simulates every single reaction. As such, approximate stochastic simulation
algorithms such as the tau-leap algorithm are often used. Potentially
computationally more efficient, the system statistics generated suffer from
significant bias unless tau is relatively small, in which case the
computational time can be comparable to that of the Gillespie algorithm. The
multi-level method (Anderson and Higham, Multiscale Model. Simul. 2012) tackles
this problem. A base estimator is computed using many (cheap) sample paths at
low accuracy. The bias inherent in this estimator is then reduced using a
number of corrections. Each correction term is estimated using a collection of
paired sample paths where one path of each pair is generated at a higher
accuracy compared to the other (and so more expensive). By sharing random
variables between these paired paths the variance of each correction estimator
can be reduced. This renders the multi-level method very efficient as only a
relatively small number of paired paths are required to calculate each
correction term. In the original multi-level method, each sample path is
simulated using the tau-leap algorithm with a fixed value of $\tau$. This
approach can result in poor performance when the reaction activity of a system
changes substantially over the timescale of interest. By introducing a novel,
adaptive time-stepping approach where $\tau$ is chosen according to the
stochastic behaviour of each sample path we extend the applicability of the
multi-level method to such cases. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method
using a number of examples.

  during real-time fMRI neurofeedback training in patients with depression"	"  Real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) is an emerging approach for studies
and novel treatments of major depressive disorder (MDD). EEG performed
simultaneously with an rtfMRI-nf procedure allows an independent evaluation of
rtfMRI-nf brain modulation effects. Frontal EEG asymmetry in the alpha band is
a widely used measure of emotion and motivation that shows profound changes in
depression. However, it has never been directly related to simultaneously
acquired fMRI data. We report the first study investigating
electrophysiological correlates of the rtfMRI-nf procedure, by combining
rtfMRI-nf with simultaneous and passive EEG recordings. In this pilot study,
MDD patients in the experimental group (n=13) learned to upregulate BOLD
activity of the left amygdala using an rtfMRI-nf during a happy emotion
induction task. MDD patients in the control group (n=11) were provided with a
sham rtfMRI-nf. Correlations between frontal EEG asymmetry in the upper alpha
band and BOLD activity across the brain were examined. Average individual
changes in frontal EEG asymmetry during the rtfMRI-nf task for the experimental
group showed a significant positive correlation with the MDD patients'
depression severity ratings, consistent with an inverse correlation between the
depression severity and frontal EEG asymmetry at rest. Temporal correlations
between frontal EEG asymmetry and BOLD activity were significantly enhanced,
during the rtfMRI-nf task, for the amygdala and many regions associated with
emotion regulation. Our findings demonstrate an important link between amygdala
BOLD activity and frontal EEG asymmetry. Our EEG asymmetry results suggest that
the rtfMRI-nf training targeting the amygdala is beneficial to MDD patients,
and that alpha-asymmetry EEG-nf would be compatible with the amygdala
rtfMRI-nf. Combination of the two could enhance emotion regulation training and
benefit MDD patients.

  variability"	"  Variability is ubiquitous in nature and a fundamental feature of complex
systems. Few studies, however, have investigated variance itself as a trait
under genetic control. By focusing primarily on trait means and ignoring the
effect of alternative alleles on trait variability, we may be missing an
important axis of genetic variation contributing to phenotypic differences
among individuals. To study genetic effects on individual-to-individual
phenotypic variability (or intragenotypic variability), we used a panel of
Drosophila inbred lines and focused on locomotor handedness, in an assay
optimized to measure variability. We discovered that some lines had
consistently high levels of intragenotypic variability among individuals while
others had low levels. We demonstrate that the degree of variability is itself
heritable. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for the degree of
intragenotypic variability as the phenotype across lines, we identified several
genes expressed in the brain that affect variability in handedness without
affecting the mean. One of these genes, Ten-a, implicated a neuropil in the
central complex of the fly brain as influencing the magnitude of behavioral
variability, a brain region involved in sensory integration and locomotor
coordination. We have validated these results using genetic deficiencies, null
alleles, and inducible RNAi transgenes. This study reveals the constellation of
phenotypes that can arise from a single genotype and it shows that different
genetic backgrounds differ dramatically in their propensity for phenotypic
variability. Because traditional mean-focused GWASs ignore the contribution of
variability to overall phenotypic variation, current methods may miss important
links between genotype and phenotype.

a fast and reliable manner. The functional architecture is thought to play a
central role in this task, by encoding efficiently complex stimuli and
facilitating higher level processing. In the early visual cortex of higher
mammals, information is processed within functional maps whose layout is
thought to underlie visual perception. The possible principles underlying the
topology of the different maps, as well as the role of a specific functional
architecture on information processing, is however poorly understood. We
demonstrate mathematically here that two natural principles, local exhaustivity
of representation and parsimony, would constrain the orientation and spatial
frequency maps to display co-located singularities around which the orientation
is organized as a pinwheel and spatial frequency as a dipole. This observation
is perfectly in line with new optical imaging data on the cat visual cortex we
analyze in a companion paper. Here we further focus on the theoretical
implications of this structure. Using a computational model, we show that this
architecture allows a trade-off in the local perception of orientation and
spatial frequency, but this would occur for sharper selectivity than the tuning
width reported in the literature. We therefore re-examined physiological data
and show that indeed the spatial frequency selectivity substantially sharpens
near maps singularities, bringing to the prediction that the system tends to
optimize balanced detection between different attributes. These results shed
new light on the principles at play in the emergence of functional architecture
of cortical maps, as well as their potential role in processing information.

Each continuous probability distribution describes how information changes with
magnitude. Once one learns to read a probability distribution as a measurement
scale of information, opportunities arise to understand the processes that
generate the commonly observed patterns. Probability expressions may be parsed
into four components: the dissipation of all information, except the
preservation of average values, taken over the measurement scale that relates
changes in observed values to changes in information, and the transformation
from the underlying scale on which information dissipates to alternative scales
on which probability pattern may be expressed. Information invariances set the
commonly observed measurement scales and the relations between them. In
particular, a measurement scale for information is defined by its invariance to
specific transformations of underlying values into measurable outputs.
Essentially all common distributions can be understood within this simple
framework of information invariance and measurement scale.

  electrical activity in uterine tissue"	"  The spontaneous emergence of contraction-inducing electrical activity in the
uterus at the beginning of labor remains poorly understood, partly due to the
seemingly contradictory observation that isolated uterine cells are not
spontaneously active. It is known, however, that the expression of gap
junctions increases dramatically in the approach to parturition, which results
in a significant increase in inter-cellular electrical coupling. In this paper,
we build upon previous studies of the activity of electrically excitable smooth
muscle cells (myocytes) and investigate the mechanism through which the
coupling of these cells to electrically passive cells results in the generation
of spontaneous activity in the uterus. Using a recently developed, realistic
model of uterine muscle cell dynamics, we investigate a system consisting of a
myocyte coupled to passive cells. We then extend our analysis to a simple
two-dimensional lattice model of the tissue, with each myocyte being coupled to
its neighbors, as well as to a random number of passive cells. We observe that
different dynamical regimes can be observed over a range of gap junction
conductances: at low coupling strength, the activity is confined to cell
clusters, while the activity for high coupling may spread across the entire
tissue. Additionally, we find that the system supports the spontaneous
generation of spiral wave activity. Our results are both qualitatively and
quantitatively consistent with observations from in vitro experiments. In
particular, we demonstrate that an increase in inter-cellular electrical
coupling, for realistic parameter values, strongly facilitates the appearance
of spontaneous action potentials that may eventually lead to parturition.

intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) even at volume fraction ($\phi$)
similar to that in the cytosol whereas DNA undergoes a coil-to-globule
transition at very small $\phi$. We show using a combination of scaling
arguments and simulations that the polymer size $\overline{R}_g(\phi)$ depends
on $x = \overline{R}_g(0)/D$ where $D$ is the $\phi$-dependent distance between
the crowders. If $x\lesssim \mathcal{O}(1)$, there is only a small decrease in
$\overline{R}_g(\phi)$ as $\phi$ increases. When $x\gg \mathcal{O}(1)$, a
cooperative coil-to-globule transition is induced. Our theory quantitatively
explains a number of experiments.

  for Apelin Signaling in Sprout Progression"	"  Angiogenesis involves the formation of new blood vessels by sprouting or
splitting of existing blood vessels. During sprouting, a highly motile type of
endothelial cell, called the tip cell, migrates from the blood vessels followed
by stalk cells, an endothelial cell type that forms the body of the sprout. To
get more insight into how tip cells contribute to angiogenesis, we extended an
existing computational model of vascular network formation based on the
cellular Potts model with tip and stalk differentiation, without making a
priori assumptions about the differences between tip cells and stalk cells. To
predict potential differences, we looked for parameter values that make tip
cells (a) move to the sprout tip, and (b) change the morphology of the
angiogenic networks. The screening predicted that if tip cells respond less
effectively to an endothelial chemoattractant than stalk cells, they move to
the tips of the sprouts, which impacts the morphology of the networks. A
comparison of this model prediction with genes expressed differentially in tip
and stalk cells revealed that the endothelial chemoattractant Apelin and its
receptor APJ may match the model prediction. To test the model prediction we
inhibited Apelin signaling in our model and in an \emph{in vitro} model of
angiogenic sprouting, and found that in both cases inhibition of Apelin or of
its receptor APJ reduces sprouting. Based on the prediction of the
computational model, we propose that the differential expression of Apelin and
APJ yields a ""self-generated"" gradient mechanisms that accelerates the
extension of the sprout.

1409.6384	q-bio	q-bio.GN	Beyond the E-value: stratified statistics for protein domain prediction	"  E-values have been the dominant statistic for protein sequence analysis for
the past two decades: from identifying statistically significant local sequence
alignments to evaluating matches to hidden Markov models describing protein
domain families. Here we formally show that for ""stratified"" multiple
hypothesis testing problems, controlling the local False Discovery Rate (lFDR)
per stratum, or partition, yields the most predictions across the data at any
given threshold on the FDR or E-value over all strata combined. For the
important problem of protein domain prediction, a key step in characterizing
protein structure, function and evolution, we show that stratifying statistical
tests by domain family yields excellent results. We develop the first
FDR-estimating algorithms for domain prediction, and evaluate how well
thresholds based on q-values, E-values and lFDRs perform in domain prediction
using five complementary approaches for estimating empirical FDRs in this
context. We show that stratified q-value thresholds substantially outperform
E-values. Contradicting our theoretical results, q-values also outperform
lFDRs; however, our tests reveal a small but coherent subset of domain
families, biased towards models for specific repetitive patterns, for which
FDRs are greatly underestimated due to weaknesses in random sequence models.
Usage of lFDR thresholds outperform q-values for the remaining families, which
have as-expected noise, suggesting that further improvements in domain
predictions can be achieved with improved modeling of random sequences.
Overall, our theoretical and empirical findings suggest that the use of
stratified q-values and lFDRs could result in improvements in a host of
structured multiple hypothesis testing problems arising in bioinformatics,
including genome-wide association studies, orthology prediction, motif
scanning, and multi-microarray analyses.

1409.6439	q-bio	physics.chem-ph q-bio.BM stat.AP	Efficient estimation of rare-event kinetics	"  The efficient calculation of rare-event kinetics in complex dynamical
systems, such as the rate and pathways of ligand dissociation from a protein,
is a generally unsolved problem. Markov state models can systematically
integrate ensembles of short simulations and thus effectively parallelize the
computational effort, but the rare events of interest still need to be
spontaneously sampled in the data. Enhanced sampling approaches, such as
parallel tempering or umbrella sampling, can accelerate the computation of
equilibrium expectations massively - but sacrifice the ability to compute
dynamical expectations. In this work we establish a principle to combine
knowledge of the equilibrium distribution with kinetics from fast ""downhill""
relaxation trajectories using reversible Markov models. This approach is
general as it does not invoke any specific dynamical model, and can provide
accurate estimates of the rare event kinetics. Large gains in sampling
efficiency can be achieved whenever one direction of the process occurs more
rapid than its reverse, making the approach especially attractive for downhill
processes such as folding and binding in biomolecules.

1409.7211	q-bio	q-bio.PE physics.bio-ph	Inferring Epigenetic Dynamics from Kin Correlations	"  Populations of isogenic embryonic stem cells or clonal bacteria often exhibit
extensive phenotypic heterogeneity which arises from stochastic intrinsic
dynamics of cells. The internal state of the cell can be transmitted
epigenetically in cell division, leading to correlations in the phenotypic
states of cells related by descent. Therefore, a phenotypic snapshot of a
collection of cells with known genealogical structure, contains information on
phenotypic dynamics. Here we use a model of phenotypic dynamics on a
genealogical tree to define an inference method which allows to extract an
approximate probabilistic description of phenotypic dynamics based on measured
correlations as a function of the degree of kinship. The approach is tested and
validated on the example of Pyoverdine dynamics in P. aeruginosa colonies.
Interestingly, we find that correlations among pairs and triples of distant
relatives have a simple but non-trivial structure indicating that observed
phenotypic dynamics on the genealogical tree is approximately conformal - a
symmetry characteristic of critical behavior in physical systems. Proposed
inference method is sufficiently general to be applied in any system where
lineage information is available.

  actin polymerization"	"  Membrane deformation inside living cells is crucial for the proper shaping of
various intracellular organelles and is necessary during the fission/fusion
processes that allow membrane recycling and transport (e.g. endocytosis).
Proteins that induce membrane curvature play a key role in such processes,
mostly by adsorbing to the membrane and forming a scaffold that deforms the
membrane according to the curvature of the proteins. In this paper we explore
the possibility of membrane tube destabilisation through a pearling mechanism
enabled by the combined effects of the adsorbed curved proteins and the actin
polymerization they may recruit. The pearling instability can furthermore serve
as the initiation for fission of the tube into vesicles. We find that adsorbed
proteins are more likely to stabilise the tubes, while the actin polymerization
can provide the additional constrictive force needed for the robust
instability. We discuss the relevance of the theoretical results to in-vivo and
in-vitro experiments.

important mosquito-borne disease of humans, and it is currently estimated that
there may be 50 - 100 million yearly dengue infections worldwide. For the
purpose to provide new techniques to public health policies in course, we
introduce a predictive non-linear population dynamics model to describe the
population size of four stages of the development of \emph{Aedes aegypti},
having the coefficients set to be dependent on the rainfall index data. In
spite of the population dynamics of the \emph{Ae. aegypti} be mainly ruled by
the rainfall regime, most models are dedicated exclusively to effects of
temperature and only few models are dedicated to influence of rainfall. Vector
control actions are also implemented in many periods of the year in order to
compare relative efficiency of public health policies. The analysis of
equilibrium and stability was performed. Field rainfall time series data from
the City of Lavras (Minas Gerais, Brazil) was used for the model evaluation.
The model was validated in a comparison with experimental mosquito abundance
data acquired by field health agents. We evaluated and validated an
entomological conjecture that claims that control actions should be performed
during the dry season, instead of the common procedure adopted by vector
control programs, in which those are mainly applied in the rainy season.

  Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication Among Bacteria"	"  The design of biologically-inspired wireless communication systems using
bacteria as the basic element of the system is initially motivated by a
phenomenon called \emph{Quorum Sensing}. Due to high randomness in the
individual behavior of a bacterium, reliable communication between two bacteria
is almost impossible. Therefore, we have recently proposed that a population of
bacteria in a cluster is considered as a bio node in the network capable of
molecular transmission and reception. This proposition enables us to form a
reliable bio node out of many unreliable bacteria.
  In this paper, we study the communication between two nodes in such a network
where information is encoded in the concentration of molecules by the
transmitter. The molecules produced by the bacteria in the transmitter node
propagate through the diffusion channel. Then, the concentration of molecules
is sensed by the bacteria population in the receiver node which would decode
the information and output light or fluorescent as a result. The uncertainty in
the communication is caused by all three components of communication, i.e.,
transmission, propagation and reception. We study the theoretical limits of the
information transfer rate in the presence of such uncertainties. Finally, we
consider M-ary signaling schemes and study their achievable rates and
corresponding error probabilities.

  next-generation sequencing"	"  Analyses of targeted genomic sequencing data from next-generation-sequencing
(NGS) technologies typically involves mapping reads to a reference sequence or
clustering reads. For a number of species a reference genome is not available
so the analyses of targeted sequencing data, for example polymorphic structural
variation caused by mobile elements is difficult; clustering methods are
preferred for such data analysis. Clustering of reads requires a clustering
threshold parameter, which is used to compare and group reads. However,
determining the optimal clustering threshold for a read dataset is challenging
because of different sequence composition, the number of sequences present, and
also the amount of sequencing errors in the dataset. High values of the
clustering threshold parameter can falsely inflate the number of recovered
genomic regions, while low values of clustering threshold can merge reads from
distinct regions into a single cluster. Thus, an algorithm that can empirically
determine clustering threshold is needed. We propose a pipeline for clustering
genomic sequences wherein the clustering threshold is empirically determined
from the NGS data. The optimal threshold is decided based on two internal
clustering measures which assess clusters for small intra-cluster diameters and
large inter-cluster distances. We evaluate the pipeline on two simulated
datasets derived from human genome sequence simulating different genomic
regions and sequencing depth. The total number of clusters obtained from our
pipeline is closer to the actual number of reference sequences when compared to
single round of clustering. Also, the number of clusters whose consensus
sequence matches a corresponding reference sequence is higher in our pipeline.
We observe that the presence of repeat regions affects clustering accuracy.

1410.1630	q-bio	stat.AP q-bio.QM	Feature extraction for proteomics imaging mass spectrometry data	"  Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) has transformed proteomics by providing an
avenue for collecting spatially distributed molecular data. Mass spectrometry
data acquired with matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) IMS
consist of tens of thousands of spectra, measured at regular grid points across
the surface of a tissue section. Unlike the more standard liquid chromatography
mass spectrometry, MALDI-IMS preserves the spatial information inherent in the
tissue. Motivated by the need to differentiate cell populations and tissue
types in MALDI-IMS data accurately and efficiently, we propose an integrated
cluster and feature extraction approach for such data. We work with the derived
binary data representing presence/absence of ions, as this is the essential
information in the data. Our approach takes advantage of the spatial structure
of the data in a noise removal and initial dimension reduction step and applies
$k$-means clustering with the cosine distance to the high-dimensional binary
data. The combined smoothing-clustering yields spatially localized clusters
that clearly show the correspondence with cancer and various noncancerous
tissue types. Feature extraction of the high-dimensional binary data is
accomplished with our difference in proportions of occurrence (DIPPS) approach
which ranks the variables and selects a set of variables in a data-driven
manner. We summarize the best variables in a single image that has a natural
interpretation. Application of our method to data from patients with ovarian
cancer shows good separation of tissue types and close agreement of our results
with tissue types identified by pathologists.

  Neocortex"	"  Balance of excitation and inhibition is a fundamental feature of in vivo
network activity and is important for its computations. However, its presence
in the neocortex of higher mammals is not well established. We investigated the
dynamics of excitation and inhibition using dense multielectrode recordings in
humans and monkeys. We found that in all states of the wake-sleep cycle,
excitatory and inhibitory ensembles are well balanced, and co-fluctuate with
slight instantaneous deviations from perfect balance, mostly in slow-wave
sleep. Remarkably, these correlated fluctuations are seen for many different
temporal scales. The similarity of these computational features with a network
model of self-generated balanced states suggests that such balanced activity is
essentially generated by recurrent activity in the local network and is not due
to external inputs. Finally, we find that this balance breaks down during
seizures, where the temporal correlation of excitatory and inhibitory
populations is disrupted. These results show that balanced activity is a
feature of normal brain activity, and break down of the balance could be an
important factor to define pathological states.

  of the Third Generation Sequencing Technologies"	"  (An updated version of this manuscript has been accepted to Scientific
Reports in 2016, please refer to http://www.nature.com/articles/srep31900)
  The highly anticipated transition from next generation sequencing (NGS) to
third generation sequencing (3GS) has been difficult primarily due to high
error rates and excessive sequencing cost. The high error rates make the
assembly of long erroneous reads of large genomes challenging because existing
software solutions are often overwhelmed by error correction tasks. Here we
report a hybrid assembly approach that simultaneously utilizes NGS and 3GS data
to address both issues. We gain advantages from three general and basic design
principles: (i) Compact representation of the long reads lead to efficient
alignments. (ii) Base-level errors can be skipped; structural errors need to be
detected and corrected. (iii) Structurally correct 3GS reads are assembled and
polished. In our implementation, preassembled NGS contigs are used to derive
the compact representation of the long reads, which established an algorithmic
conversion from a de Bruijn graph to an overlap graph, the two major assembly
paradigms. Moreover, since NGS and 3GS data can compensate each other, our
hybrid assembly approach reduces both of their sequencing requirements.
Experiments show that our software is able to assemble mammalian-sized genomes
orders of magnitude more efficiently in time than existing methods, while
saving about half of the sequencing cost.

  from individual birds fluctuations"	"  One of the most impressive features of moving animal groups is their ability
to perform sudden coherent changes in travel direction. While this collective
decision can be a response to an external perturbation, such as the presence of
a predator, recent studies show that such directional switching can also emerge
from the intrinsic fluctuations in the individual behaviour. However, the cause
and the mechanism by which such collective changes of direction occur are not
fully understood yet. Here, we present an experimental study of spontaneous
collective turns in natural flocks of starlings. We employ a recently developed
tracking algorithm to reconstruct three-dimensional trajectories of each
individual bird in the flock for the whole duration of a turning event. Our
approach enables us to analyze changes in the individual behavior of every
group member and reveal the emergent dynamics of turning. We show that
spontaneous turns start from individuals located at the elongated edges of the
flocks, and then propagate through the group. We find that birds on the edges
deviate from the mean direction of motion much more frequently than other
individuals, indicating that persistent localized fluctuations are the crucial
ingredient for triggering a collective directional change. Finally, we
quantitatively show that birds follow equal radius paths during turning
allowing the flock to change orientation and redistribute risky locations among
group members. The whole process of turning is a remarkable example of how a
self-organized system can sustain collective changes and reorganize, while
retaining coherence.

1410.3951	q-bio	q-bio.QM	Extracting Hidden Hierarchies in 3D Distribution Networks	"  Natural and man-made transport webs are frequently dominated by dense sets of
nested cycles. The architecture of these networks, as defined by the topology
and edge weights, determines how efficiently the networks perform their
function. Yet, the set of tools that can characterize such a weighted
cycle-rich architecture in a physically relevant, mathematically compact way is
sparse. In order to fill this void, we have developed a new algorithm that
rests on an abstraction of the physical `tiling' in the case of a two
dimensional network to an effective tiling of an abstract surface in space that
the network may be thought to sit in. Generically these abstract surfaces are
richer than the flat plane and as a result there are now two families of
fundamental units that may aggregate upon cutting weakest links -- the
plaquettes of the tiling and the longer `topological' cycles associated with
the abstract surface itself. Upon sequential removal of the weakest links, as
determined by the edge weight, neighboring plaquettes merge and a tree
characterizing this merging process results. The properties of this
characteristic tree can provide the physical and topological data required to
describe the architecture of the network and to build physical models. The new
algorithm can be used for automated phenotypic characterization of any weighted
network whose structure is dominated by cycles, such as mammalian vasculature
in the organs, the root networks of clonal colonies like quaking aspen, or the
force networks in jammed granular matter.

  Networks"	"  To gain insight into the neural events responsible for visual perception of
static and dynamic optical patterns, we study how neural activation spreads in
arrays of inhibition-stabilized neural networks with nearest-neighbor coupling.
The activation generated in such networks by local stimuli propagates between
locations, forming spatiotemporal waves that affect the dynamics of activation
generated by stimuli separated spatially and temporally, and by stimuli with
complex spatiotemporal structure. These interactions form characteristic
interference patterns that make the network intrinsically selective for certain
stimuli, such as modulations of luminance at specific spatial and temporal
frequencies and specific velocities of visual motion. Due to the inherent
nonlinearity of the network, its intrinsic tuning depends on stimulus intensity
and contrast. The interference patterns have multiple features of ""lateral""
interactions between stimuli, well known in physiological and behavioral
studies of visual systems. The diverse phenomena have been previously
attributed to distinct neural circuits. Our results demonstrate how the
canonical circuit can perform the diverse operations in a manner predicted by
neural-wave interference.

this study, we propose a novel multimodal network approach based on multidi-
mensional persistent homology. In this extension of the previous threshold-free
method of persistent homology, we visualize and discriminate the topological
change of integrated brain networks by varying not only threshold but also
mixing ratios between two different imaging modalities. Moreover, we also pro-
pose an integration method for multimodal networks, called one-dimensional
projection, with a specific mixing ratio between modalities. We applied the
proposed methods to PET and MRI data from 21 autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
children and 10 pediatric control subjects. From the results, we found that the
brain networks of ASD children and controls differ significantly, with ASD
showing asymmetrical changes of connected structures between PET and MRI. The
integrated MRI and PET networks showed that ASD children had weaker connections
than controls within the visual cortex, between dorsal and ventral parts of the
temporal pole, between frontal and parietal regions, and between the left
perisylvian and other brain regions. These results provide a multidimensional
homological understanding of disease-related PET and MRI networks that

  common size regulation strategy"	"  To maintain a constant cell size, dividing cells have to coordinate cell
cycle events with cell growth. This coordination has for long been supposed to
rely on the existence of size thresholds determining cell cycle progression
[1]. In budding yeast, size is controlled at the G1/S transition [11]. In
agreement with this hypothesis, the size at birth influences the time spent in
G1: smaller cells have a longer G1 period [3]. Nevertheless, even though cells
born smaller have a longer G1, the compensation is imperfect and they still bud
at smaller cell sizes. In bacteria, several recent studies have shown that the
incremental model of size control, in which size is controlled by addition of a
constant volume (in contrast to a size threshold), is able to quantitatively
explain the experimental data on 4 different bacterial species [6, 5, 6, 7].
Here, we report on experimental results for the budding yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, finding, surprisingly, that cell size control in this organism is
very well described by the incremental model, suggesting a common strategy for
cell size control with bacteria. Additionally, we argue that for S. cerevisiae
the volume increment is not added from birth to division, but rather between
two budding events.

that periods of individual fibril growth are interrupted by periods of stasis.
The growth probability is large at high and low concentrations and is reduced
for intermediate glucagon concentrations. To explain this behavior we propose a

monomers and one entirely from glucagon trimers. The opposite building blocks
act as fibril growth blockers, and this generic model reproduces experimental

  length distribution"	"  Identity-by-descent (IBD) is a fundamental concept in genetics with many
applications. In a common definition, two haplotypes are said to contain an IBD
segment if they share a segment that is inherited from a recent shared common
ancestor without intervening recombination. Long IBD segments (> 1cM) can be
efficiently detected by a number of algorithms using high-density SNP array
data from a population sample. However, these approaches detect IBD based on
contiguous segments of identity-by-state, and such segments may exist due to
the conflation of smaller, nearby IBD segments. We quantified this effect using
coalescent simulations, finding that nearly 40% of inferred segments 1-2cM long
are results of conflations of two or more shorter segments, under demographic
scenarios typical for modern humans. This biases the inferred IBD segment
length distribution, and so can affect downstream inferences. We observed this
conflation effect universally across different IBD detection programs and human
demographic histories, and found inference of segments longer than 2cM to be
much more reliable (less than 5% conflation rate). As an example of how this
can negatively affect downstream analyses, we present and analyze a novel
estimator of the de novo mutation rate using IBD segments, and demonstrate that
the biased length distribution of the IBD segments due to conflation can lead
to inflated estimates if the conflation is not modeled. Understanding the
conflation effect in detail will make its correction in future methods more
tractable.

mRNA have been analyzed against a previously hypothesized single molecule
degradation pathway. According to that hypothesis, the silencing complex
(miRISC) first interacts with its target mRNA and then recruits the protein
complexes associated with NOT1 and PAN3 to trigger deadenylation (and
subsequent degradation) of the target mRNA. Our analysis of the experimental
decay patterns allowed us to refine the structure of the degradation pathways
at the single molecule level. Surprisingly, we found that if the previously
hypothesized network was correct, only about 7% of the target mRNA would be
regulated by the miRNA mechanism, which is inconsistent with the available
knowledge. Based on systematic data analysis, we propose the alternative
hypothesis that NOT1 interacts with miRISC before binding to the target mRNA.
Moreover, we show that when miRISC binds alone to the target mRNA, the mRNA is
degraded more slowly, probably through a deadenylation-independent pathway. The
new biochemical pathway we propose both fits the data and paves the way for new
experimental work to identify new interactions.

  biomolecular networks"	"  Homeostasis is a running theme in biology. Often achieved through feedback
regulation strategies, homeostasis allows living cells to control their
internal environment as a means for surviving changing and unfavourable
environments. While many endogenous homeostatic motifs have been studied in
living cells, some other motifs may remain under-explored or even undiscovered.
At the same time, known regulatory motifs have been mostly analyzed at the
deterministic level, and the effect of noise on their regulatory function has
received low attention. Here we lay the foundation for a regulation theory at
the molecular level that explicitly takes into account the noisy nature of
biochemical reactions and provides novel tools for the analysis and design of
robust homeostatic circuits. Using these ideas, we propose a new regulation
motif, which we refer to as {\em antithetic integral feedback, and demonstrate
its effectiveness as a strategy for generically regulating a wide class of
reaction networks. By combining tools from probability and control theory, we
show that the proposed motif preserves the stability of the overall network,
steers the population of any regulated species to a desired set point, and
achieves robust perfect adaptation -- all with low prior knowledge of reaction
rates. Moreover, our proposed regulatory motif can be implemented using a very
small number of molecules and hence has a negligible metabolic load.
Strikingly, the regulatory motif exploits stochastic noise, leading to enhanced
regulation in scenarios where noise-free implementations result in
dysregulation. Finally, we discuss the possible manifestation of the proposed
antithetic integral feedback motif in endogenous biological circuits and its
realization in synthetic circuits.

the season of interest using modified versions of data from previous seasons,
allowing for reasonable variations in the timing, pace, and intensity of the
seasonal epidemics, as well as noise in observations. Since the framework does
not make strict domain-specific assumptions, it can easily be applied to other
diseases as well. Another important advantage of this method is that it
produces a complete posterior distribution for any desired forecasting target,
rather than mere point predictions. We report prospective
influenza-like-illness forecasts that were made for the 2013--2014 U.S.
influenza season, and compare the framework's cross-validated prediction error
on historical data to that of a variety of simpler baseline predictors.

assumption in the study of epidemics, but neglects important differences in
contact rates within and between population groups. For HIV/AIDS, the
assumption of random mixing is inappropriate for epidemics that are
concentrated in groups of people at high risk, including female sex workers
(FSW) and their male clients (MCF), injection drug users (IDU) and men who have
sex with men (MSM). To find out who transmits infection to whom and how that
affects the spread and containment of infection remains a major empirical
challenge in the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS. Here we develop a technique, based
on the routine sampling of infection in linked population groups, which shows
how an Asian HIV/AIDS epidemic began in FSW, was propagated mainly by IDU, and
ultimately generated most cases among the female partners of MCF (FPM).
Calculation of the case reproduction numbers within and between groups, and for
the whole network, provides insights into control that cannot be deduced simply
from observations on the prevalence of infection. Specifically, the per capita
rate of HIV transmission was highest from FSW to MCF, and most HIV infections
occurred in FPM, but the number of infections in the whole network is best
reduced by interrupting transmission to and from IDU. This network analysis can
be used to guide HIV/AIDS interventions based on needle exchange, condom
distribution and antiretroviral therapy. The method requires only routine data
and could be applied to infections in other populations.

  Boundaries"	"  Chemical reactions inside cells are generally considered to happen within
fixed-size compartments. Needless to say, cells and their compartments are
highly dynamic. Thus, such stringent assumptions may not reflect biochemical
reality, and can highly bias conclusions from simulation studies. In this work,
we present an intuitive algorithm for particle-based diffusion in and on moving
boundaries, for both point particles and spherical particles. We first
benchmark in appropriate scenarios our proposed stochastic method against
solutions of partial differential equations, and further demonstrate that
moving boundaries can give rise to super diffusive motion as well as
time-inhomogeneous reaction rates. Finally, we conduct a numerical experiment
representing photobleaching of diffusing fluorescent proteins in dividing
Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to demonstrate that moving boundaries might
cause important effects neglected in previously published studies.

discriminate at least 1 trillion odors. The authors reached that conclusion
after performing just 260 comparisons of two smells, of which about half could
be discriminated. Furthermore the paper claims that the human ability to
discriminate smells vastly exceeds our abilities to discriminate colors or
musical tones. Here I show that all these statements are wrong by astronomical
factors. A reanalysis of the authors' experiments shows they are also
consistent with humans discriminating just 10 odors. The paper's extravagant
claims are based on errors of mathematical logic. Further analysis highlights
the importance of establishing how many dimensions the perceptual odor space
has. I review some arguments on the topic and propose experimental avenues
towards an answer.

machineries including the dedicated transporter known as PIN. The associated
transport is ordered with nearby cells driving auxin flux in similar
directions. Here we provide a model of both the auxin transport and of the
dynamics of cellular polarisation based on flux sensing. Our main findings are:
(i) spontaneous intracellular PIN polarisation arises if PIN recycling dynamics
are sufficiently non-linear, (ii) there is no need for an auxin concentration
gradient, and (iii) ordered multi-cellular patterns of PIN polarisation are
favored by molecular noise.

of binary output, binary channel state, and arbitrary finite input alphabets.
We show that the capacity-achieving input distribution is IID. Further, we show
that feedback does not increase the capacity of this channel. We show how the

  Networks of Neurons with Noise"	"  Mean-field systems have been previously derived for networks of coupled,
two-dimensional, integrate-and-fire neurons such as the Izhikevich, adapting
exponential (AdEx) and quartic integrate and fire (QIF), among others.
Unfortunately, the mean-field systems have a degree of frequency error and the
networks analyzed often do not include noise when there is adaptation. Here, we
derive a one-dimensional partial differential equation (PDE) approximation for
the marginal voltage density under a first order moment closure for coupled
networks of integrate-and-fire neurons with white noise inputs. The PDE has
substantially less frequency error than the mean-field system, and provides a
great deal more information, at the cost of analytical tractability. The
convergence properties of the mean-field system in the low noise limit are
elucidated. A novel method for the analysis of the stability of the
asynchronous tonic firing solution is also presented and implemented. Unlike
previous attempts at stability analysis with these network types, information
about the marginal densities of the adaptation variables is used. This method
can in principle be applied to other systems with nonlinear partial
differential equations.

  molecular motors"	"  We formulate and characterize a model to describe the dynamics of
semiflexible polymers in the presence of activity due to motor proteins
attached irreversibly to a substrate, and a transverse pulling force acting on
one end of the filament. The stochastic binding-unbinding of the motor proteins
and their ability to move along the polymer, generates active forces. As the
pulling force reaches a threshold value, the polymer eventually desorbs from
the substrate. Performing molecular dynamics simulations of the polymer in
presence of a Langevin heat bath, and stochastic motor activity, we obtain
desorption phase diagrams. The correlation time for fluctuations in desorbed
fraction increases as one approaches complete desorption, captured
quantitatively by a power law spectral density. We present theoretical analysis
of the phase diagram using mean field approximations in the weakly bending
limit of the polymer and performing linear stability analysis. This predicts
increase in the desorption force with the polymer bending rigidity, active
velocity and processivity of the motor proteins to capture the main features of
the simulation results.

1411.3383	q-bio	q-bio.BM	"The interplay of intrinsic disorder and macromolecular crowding on
  {\alpha}-synuclein fibril formation"	"  {\alpha}-synuclein ({\alpha}-syn) is an intrinsically disordered protein
which is considered to be one of the causes of Parkinson's disease. This
protein forms amyloid fibrils when in a highly concentrated solution. The
fibril formation of {\alpha}-syn is induced not only by increases in
{\alpha}-syn concentration but also by macromolecular crowding. In order to
investigate the coupled effect of the intrinsic disorder of {\alpha}-syn and
macromolecular crowding, we construct a lattice gas model of {\alpha}-syn in
contact with a crowding agent reservoir based on statistical mechanics. The
main assumption is that {\alpha}-syn can be expressed as coarse-grained
particles with internal states coupled with effective volume; and disordered
states are modeled by larger particles with larger internal entropy than other
states. Thanks to the simplicity of the model, we can exactly calculate the
number of conformations of crowding agents, and this enables us to prove that
the original grand canonical ensemble with a crowding agent reservoir is
mathematically equivalent to a canonical ensemble without crowding agents. In
this expression, the effect of macromolecular crowding is absorbed in the
internal entropy of disordered states; it is clearly shown that the crowding
effect reduces the internal entropy. Based on Monte Carlo simulation, we
provide scenarios of crowding-induced fibril formation. We also discuss the
recent controversy over the existence of helically folded tetramers of
{\alpha}-syn, and suggest that macromolecular crowding is the key to resolving
the controversy.

the study of robustness in nonlinear gene regulatory networks, represented by
time- and state-discrete dynamical systems taking on multiple states. The focus
is on networks governed by nested canalizing functions (NCFs), first introduced
in the Boolean context by S. Kauffman. After giving a general definition of
NCFs we analyze the class of such functions. We derive a formula for the
normalized average $c$-sensitivities of multistate NCFs, which enables the
calculation of the Derrida plot, a popular measure of network stability. We
also provide a unique canonical parametrized polynomial form of NCFs. This form
has several consequences. We can easily generate NCFs for varying parameter
choices, and derive a closed form formula for the number of such functions in a
given number of variables, as well as an asymptotic formula. Finally, we
compute the number of equivalence classes of NCFs under permutation of
variables. Together, the results of the paper represent a useful mathematical
framework for the study of NCFs and their dynamic networks.

1411.4321	q-bio	q-bio.CB	"Individuality and universality in the growth-division laws of single E.
  coli cells"	"  The mean size of exponentially dividing E. coli cells cultured in different
nutrient conditions is known to depend on the mean growth rate only. However,
the joint fluctuations relating cell size, doubling time and individual growth
rate are only starting to be characterized. Recent studies in bacteria (i)
revealed the near constancy of the size extension in a single cell cycle (adder
mechanism), and (ii) reported a universal trend where the spread in both size
and doubling times is a linear function of the population means of these
variables. Here, we combine experiments and theory and use scaling concepts to
elucidate the constraints posed by the second observation on the division
control mechanism and on the joint fluctuations of sizes and doubling times. We
found that scaling relations based on the means both collapse size and
doubling-time distributions across different conditions, and explain how the
shape of their joint fluctuations deviates from the means. Our data on these
joint fluctuations highlight the importance of cell individuality: single cells
do not follow the dependence observed for the means between size and either
growth rate or inverse doubling time. Our calculations show that these results
emerge from a broad class of division control mechanisms (including the adder
mechanism as a particular case) requiring a certain scaling form of the
so-called ""division hazard rate function"", which defines the probability rate
of dividing as a function of measurable parameters. This gives a rationale for
the universal body-size distributions observed in microbial ecosystems across
many microbial species, presumably dividing with multiple mechanisms.
Additionally, our experiments show a crossover between fast and slow growth in
the relation between individual-cell growth rate and division time, which can
be understood in terms of different regimes of genome replication control.

  cortex"	"  Neural correlations during a cognitive task are central to study brain
information processing and computation. However, they have been poorly analyzed
due to the difficulty of recording simultaneous single neurons during task
performance. In the present work, we quantified neural directional correlations
using spike trains that were simultaneously recorded in sensory, premotor, and
motor cortical areas of two monkeys during a somatosensory discrimination task.
Upon modeling spike trains as binary time series, we used a nonparametric
Bayesian method to estimate pairwise directional correlations between many
pairs of neurons throughout different stages of the task, namely, perception,
working memory, decision making, and motor report. We find that solving the
task involves feedforward and feedback correlation paths linking sensory and
motor areas during certain task intervals. Specifically, information is
communicated by task-driven neural correlations that are significantly delayed
across secondary somatosensory cortex, premotor, and motor areas when decision
making takes place. Crucially, when sensory comparison is no longer requested
for task performance, a major proportion of directional correlations
consistently vanish across all cortical areas.

selection. The individuals are sequences of fixed length over a finite
alphabet. On the sharp peak fitness landscape together with independent
mutations per locus, we show that, as the length of the sequences goes to
$\infty$ and the mutation probability goes to 0, the asymptotic relative
frequency of the sequences differing on $k$ digits from the master sequence
approaches $$(\sigma
e^{-a}-1)\frac{a^k}{k!}\sum_{i\geq1}\frac{i^k}{\sigma^i}\,,$$ where $\sigma$ is
the selective advantage of the master sequence and $a$ is the product of the
length of the chains with the mutation probability. The probability
distribution $\mathcal{Q}(\sigma,a)$ on the non negative integers given by the
above formula is the quasispecies distribution with parameters $\sigma$ and
$a$.

1411.4747	q-bio	math.PR q-bio.PE	A new coalescent for seed-bank models	"  We identify a new natural coalescent structure, which we call the seed-bank
coalescent, that describes the gene genealogy of populations under the
influence of a strong seed-bank effect, where ""dormant forms"" of individuals
(such as seeds or spores) may jump a significant number of generations before
joining the ""active"" population. Mathematically, our seed-bank coalescent
appears as scaling limit in a Wright-Fisher model with geometric seed-bank age
structure if the average time of seed dormancy scales with the order of the
total population size $N$. This extends earlier results of Kaj, Krone and
Lascoux [J. Appl. Probab. 38 (2011) 285-300] who show that the genealogy of a
Wright-Fisher model in the presence of a ""weak"" seed-bank effect is given by a
suitably time-changed Kingman coalescent. The qualitatively new feature of the
seed-bank coalescent is that ancestral lineages are independently blocked at a
certain rate from taking part in coalescence events, thus strongly altering the
predictions of classical coalescent models. In particular, the seed-bank
coalescent ""does not come down from infinity,"" and the time to the most recent
common ancestor of a sample of size $n$ grows like $\log\log n$. This is in
line with the empirical observation that seed-banks drastically increase
genetic variability in a population and indicates how they may serve as a
buffer against other evolutionary forces such as genetic drift and selection.

1411.4770	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Scalability of asynchronous networks is limited by one-to-one mapping
  between effective connectivity and correlations"	"  Network models are routinely downscaled compared to nature in terms of
numbers of nodes or edges because of a lack of computational resources, often
without explicit mention of the limitations this entails. While reliable
methods have long existed to adjust parameters such that the first-order
statistics of network dynamics are conserved, here we show that limitations
already arise if also second-order statistics are to be maintained. The
temporal structure of pairwise averaged correlations in the activity of
recurrent networks is determined by the effective population-level
connectivity. We first show that in general the converse is also true and
explicitly mention degenerate cases when this one-to-one relationship does not
hold. The one-to-one correspondence between effective connectivity and the
temporal structure of pairwise averaged correlations implies that network
scalings should preserve the effective connectivity if pairwise averaged
correlations are to be held constant. Changes in effective connectivity can
even push a network from a linearly stable to an unstable, oscillatory regime
and vice versa. On this basis, we derive conditions for the preservation of
both mean population-averaged activities and pairwise averaged correlations
under a change in numbers of neurons or synapses in the asynchronous regime
typical of cortical networks. We find that mean activities and correlation
structure can be maintained by an appropriate scaling of the synaptic weights,
but only over a range of numbers of synapses that is limited by the variance of
external inputs to the network. Our results therefore show that the
reducibility of asynchronous networks is fundamentally limited.

  activation of A$_{2A}$ adenosine receptor"	"  Dynamics and functions of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are accurately
regulated by the type of ligands that bind to the orthosteric or allosteric
binding sites. To glean the structural and dynamical origin of ligand-dependent
modulation of GPCR activity, we performed total $\sim$ 5 $\mu$sec molecular
dynamics simulations of A$_{2A}$ adenosine receptor (A$_{2A}$AR) in its apo,
antagonist-bound, and agonist-bound forms in an explicit water and membrane
environment, and examined the corresponding dynamics and correlation between
the 10 key structural motifs that serve as the allosteric hotspots in
intramolecular signaling network. We dubbed these 10 structural motifs ""binary
switches"" as they display molecular interactions that switch between two
distinct states. By projecting the receptor dynamics on these binary switches
that yield $2^{10}$ microstates, we show that (i) the receptors in apo,
antagonist-bound, and agonist-bound states explore vastly different
conformational space; (ii) among the three receptor states the apo state
explores the broadest range of microstates; (iii) in the presence of the
agonist, the active conformation is maintained through coherent couplings among
the binary switches; and (iv) to be most specific, our analysis shows that
W246, located deep inside the binding cleft, can serve as both an agonist
sensor and actuator of ensuing intramolecular signaling for the receptor
activation.Finally, our analysis of multiple trajectories generated by
inserting an agonist to the apo state underscores that the transition of the
receptor from inactive to active form requires the disruption of ionic-lock in
the DRY motif.

formation in finite zoological populations of multitype females and males. In
this article, we study SEM with Poisson firing times. First, we prove that the
model enjoys a fluid limit as the population size diverges, i.e., the
stochastic dynamics converges to a deterministic system governed by coupled
ODEs. Then, we convert these ODEs to the well-known Lotka-Volterra and
replicator equations from population dynamics. Next, under the so-called fine
balance condition which characterizes panmixia, we solve the corresponding
replicator equations and give an exact expression for the fluid limit. Finally,
we consider the case with two types of females and males. Without the fine
balance assumption, but under certain symmetry conditions, we give an explicit
formula for the limiting mating pattern, and then use it to characterize
assortative mating.

1411.7635	q-bio	q-bio.NC	A statistical model for in vivo neuronal dynamics	"  Single neuron models have a long tradition in computational neuroscience.
Detailed biophysical models such as the Hodgkin-Huxley model as well as
simplified neuron models such as the class of integrate-and-fire models relate
the input current to the membrane potential of the neuron. Those types of
models have been extensively fitted to in vitro data where the input current is
controlled. Those models are however of little use when it comes to
characterize intracellular in vivo recordings since the input to the neuron is
not known. Here we propose a novel single neuron model that characterizes the
statistical properties of in vivo recordings. More specifically, we propose a
stochastic process where the subthreshold membrane potential follows a Gaussian
process and the spike emission intensity depends nonlinearly on the membrane
potential as well as the spiking history. We first show that the model has a
rich dynamical repertoire since it can capture arbitrary subthreshold
autocovariance functions, firing-rate adaptations as well as arbitrary shapes
of the action potential. We then show that this model can be efficiently fitted
to data without overfitting. Finally, we show that this model can be used to
characterize and therefore precisely compare various intracellular in vivo
recordings from different animals and experimental conditions.

1411.7916	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"The effect of heterogeneity on decorrelation mechanisms in spiking
  neural networks: a neuromorphic-hardware study"	"  High-level brain function such as memory, classification or reasoning can be
realized by means of recurrent networks of simplified model neurons. Analog
neuromorphic hardware constitutes a fast and energy efficient substrate for the
implementation of such neural computing architectures in technical applications
and neuroscientific research. The functional performance of neural networks is
often critically dependent on the level of correlations in the neural activity.
In finite networks, correlations are typically inevitable due to shared
presynaptic input. Recent theoretical studies have shown that inhibitory
feedback, abundant in biological neural networks, can actively suppress these
shared-input correlations and thereby enable neurons to fire nearly
independently. For networks of spiking neurons, the decorrelating effect of
inhibitory feedback has so far been explicitly demonstrated only for
homogeneous networks of neurons with linear sub-threshold dynamics. Theory,
however, suggests that the effect is a general phenomenon, present in any
system with sufficient inhibitory feedback, irrespective of the details of the
network structure or the neuronal and synaptic properties. Here, we investigate
the effect of network heterogeneity on correlations in sparse, random networks
of inhibitory neurons with non-linear, conductance-based synapses. Emulations
of these networks on the analog neuromorphic hardware system Spikey allow us to
test the efficiency of decorrelation by inhibitory feedback in the presence of
hardware-specific heterogeneities. The configurability of the hardware
substrate enables us to modulate the extent of heterogeneity in a systematic
manner. We selectively study the effects of shared input and recurrent
connections on correlations in membrane potentials and spike trains. Our
results confirm ...

  world: two policy choices and underlying trade-offs"	"  The case of fisheries management illustrates how the inherent structural
instability of ecosystems can have deep-running policy implications. We
contrast ten types of management plans to achieve maximum sustainable yields
(MSY) from multiple stocks and compare their effectiveness based on a
management strategy evaluation (MSE) that uses complex food webs in its
operating model. Plans that target specific stock sizes ($B_{\text{MSY}}$)
consistently led to higher yields than plans targeting specific fishing
pressures ($F_{\text{MSY}}$). A new self-optimising control rule, introduced
here for its robustness to structural instability, led to intermediate yields.
Most plans outperformed single-species management plans with pressure targets
set without considering multispecies interactions. However, more refined plans
to ""maximise the yield from each stock separately"", in the sense of a Nash
equilibrium, produced total yields comparable to plans aiming to maximise total
harvested biomass, and were more robust to structural instability. Our analyses
highlight trade-offs between yields, amenability to negotiations, pressures on
biodiversity, and continuity with current approaches in the European context.
Based on these results, we recommend directions for developments of EU
fisheries policy.

  in conifer needles"	"  The phloem vascular system facilitates transport of energy-rich sugar and
signaling molecules in plants, thus permitting long range communication within
the organism and growth of non-photosynthesizing organs such as roots and
fruits. The flow is driven by osmotic pressure, generated by differences in
sugar concentration between distal parts of the plant. The phloem is an
intricate distribution system, and many questions about its regulation and
structural diversity remain unanswered. Here, we investigate the phloem
structure in the simplest possible geometry: a linear leaf, found, for example,
in the needles of conifer trees. We measure the phloem structure in four tree
species representing a diverse set of habitats and needle sizes, from 1 cm
(\textit{Picea omorika}) to 35 cm (\textit{Pinus palustris}). We show that the
phloem shares common traits across these four species and find that the size of
its conductive elements obeys a power law. We present a minimal model that
accounts for these common traits and takes into account the transport strategy
and natural constraints. This minimal model predicts a power law phloem
distribution consistent with transport energy minimization, suggesting that
energetics are more important than translocation speed at the leaf level.

homology are the barcode and the persistence diagram. Another summary
statistic, the persistence landscape, was recently introduced by Bubenik. It is
a functional summary, so it is easy to calculate sample means and variances,
and it is straightforward to construct various test statistics. Implementing a
permutation test we detect conformational changes between closed and open forms
of the maltose-binding protein, a large biomolecule consisting of 370 amino
acid residues. Furthermore, persistence landscapes can be applied to machine
learning methods. A hyperplane from a support vector machine shows the clear
separation between the closed and open proteins conformations. Moreover,
because our approach captures dynamical properties of the protein our results
may help in identifying residues susceptible to ligand binding; we show that
the majority of active site residues and allosteric pathway residues are
located in the vicinity of the most persistent loop in the corresponding

context of a model population of Boolean graphs evolved under selection for
short dynamical attractors. We define the adjacency matrix of a graph as its
genotype, which gets mutated in the course of evolution, while its phenotype is
its set of dynamical attractors. Metanetworks in the genotype and phenotype
spaces are formed, respectively, by genetic proximity and by phenotypic
similarity, the latter weighted by the sizes of the basins of attraction of the
shared attractors. We find that populations of evolved networks form giant
clusters in genotype space, have Poissonian degree distributions but exhibit
hierarchically organized $\kappa$-core decompositions. Nevertheless, at large
scales, they form tree-like expander graphs. Random populations of Boolean
graphs are typically so far removed from each other genetically that they
cannot form a metanetwork. In phenotype space, the metanetworks of evolved
populations are super robust both under the elimination of weak connections and

reproduce in the natural environment that they inhabit. From a biological
standpoint, it has long been understood that adaptation comes from natural
selection, whereby maladapted individuals do not pass their traits effectively
to future generations. However, we may also consider the phenomenon of
adaptation from the standpoint of physics, and ask whether it is possible to
delineate what the difference is in terms of physical properties between
something that is well-adapted to its surrounding environment, and something
that is not. In this work, we undertake to address this question from a
theoretical standpoint. Building on past fundamental results in
far-from-equilibrium statistical mechanics, we demonstrate a generalization of
the Helmholtz free energy for the finite-time stochastic evolution of driven
Newtonian matter. By analyzing this expression term by term, we are able to
argue for a general tendency in driven many-particle systems towards
self-organization into states formed through exceptionally reliable absorption
and dissipation of work energy from the surrounding environment. Subsequently,
we illustrate the mechanism of this general tendency towards physical
adaptation by analyzing the process of random hopping in driven energy
landscapes.

1412.2153	q-bio	q-bio.MN q-bio.QM	"Accelerated Sensitivity Analysis in High-Dimensional Stochastic Reaction
  Networks"	"  In this paper, a two-step strategy for parametric sensitivity analysis for
such systems is proposed, exploiting advantages and synergies between two
recently proposed sensitivity analysis methodologies for stochastic dynamics.
The first method performs sensitivity analysis of the stochastic dynamics by
means of the Fisher Information Matrix on the underlying distribution of the
trajectories; the second method is a reduced-variance, finite-difference,
gradient-type sensitivity approach relying on stochastic coupling techniques
for variance reduction. Here we demonstrate that these two methods can be
combined and deployed together by means of a new sensitivity bound which
incorporates the variance of the quantity of interest as well as the Fisher
Information Matrix estimated from the first method. The first step of the
proposed strategy labels sensitivities using the bound and screens out the
insensitive parameters in a controlled manner based also on the new sensitivity
bound. In the second step of the proposed strategy, the finite-difference
method is applied only for the sensitivity estimation of the (potentially)
sensitive parameters that have not been screened out in the first step. Results
on an epidermal growth factor network with fifty parameters and on a protein
homeostasis with eighty parameters demonstrate that the proposed strategy is
able to quickly discover and discard the insensitive parameters and in the
remaining potentially sensitive parameters it accurately estimates the
sensitivities. The new sensitivity strategy can be several times faster than
current state-of-the-art approaches that test all parameters, especially in
""sloppy"" systems. In particular, the computational acceleration is quantified
by the ratio between the total number of parameters over the number of the
sensitive parameters.

membrane curvature, and play crucial roles for organizing and remodelling cell
membranes. However, the molecular driving forces behind these processes are not
well understood. Here, we describe a new approach to study curvature sensing,
by simulating the direction-dependent interactions of single molecules with a
buckled lipid bilayer. We analyse three amphipathic antimicrobial peptides, a
class of membrane-associated molecules that specifically target and destabilize
bacterial membranes, and find qualitatively different sensing characteristics
that would be difficult to resolve with other methods. These findings provide
new insights into the curvature sensing mechanisms of amphipathic peptides and
challenge existing theories of hydrophobic insertion. Our approach is generally
applicable to a wide range of curvature sensing molecules, and our results
provide strong motivation to develop new experimental methods to track position
and orientation of membrane proteins.

1412.3353	q-bio	q-bio.MN	Detecting the Escherichia coli metabolic backbone	"  The heterogeneity of reaction fluxes present in a metabolic network within a
single flux state can be exploited to construct the so-called backbone as a
reduced version of metabolism. The backbone maintains all significant fluxes
producing or consuming metabolites while displaying a substantially decreased
number of interconnections and, hence, it becomes a useful tool to extract
primary metabolic routes. Here, we disclose the metabolic backbone of
Escherichia coli using the computationally predicted fluxes which maximize the
growth rate in glucose minimal medium, and we compare it with the backbone of
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a much simpler organism. We find that the central core
in both backbones is mainly composed of reactions in ancient pathways, still
playing at present a key role in energy metabolism. In E. coli, the analysis of
the backbone reveals that the synthesis of nucleotides and the metabolism of
lipids form smaller cores which rely critically on energy metabolism; but not
conversely. At the same time, an analysis of the dependence of this backbone on
media composition leads to the identification of pathways sensitive to
environmental changes. The metabolic backbone of an organism is thus useful to
trace simultaneously both its evolution and adaptation fingerprints.

  biological systems"	"  The multi-level method for discrete state systems, first introduced by
Anderson and Higham [Multiscale Model. Simul. 10:146--179, 2012], is a highly
efficient simulation technique that can be used to elucidate statistical
characteristics of biochemical reaction networks. A single point estimator is
produced in a cost-effective manner by combining a number of estimators of
differing accuracy in a telescoping sum, and, as such, the method has the
potential to revolutionise the field of stochastic simulation. The first term
in the sum is calculated using an approximate simulation algorithm, and can be
calculated quickly but is of significant bias. Subsequent terms successively
correct this bias by combining estimators from approximate stochastic
simulations algorithms of increasing accuracy, until a desired level of
accuracy is reached.
  In this paper we present several refinements of the multi-level method which
render it easier to understand and implement, and also more efficient. Given
the substantial and complex nature of the multi-level method, the first part of
this work (Sections 2 - 5) is written as a tutorial, with the aim of providing
a practical guide to its use. The second part (Sections 6 - 8) takes on a form
akin to a research article, thereby providing the means for a deft
implementation of the technique, and concludes with a discussion of a number of
open problems.

index is based on the integration of the kernel estimation of the
cross-correlation function. It is used to test for the dynamic synchronization
levels of spontaneous neural activity under two induced brain states:
sleep-like and awake-like. Two bootstrap resampling plans are proposed to
approximate the distribution of the test statistics. The results of the first
bootstrap method indicate that it is useful to discern significant differences
in the synchronization dynamics of brain states characterized by a neural
activity with low firing rate. The second bootstrap method is useful to unveil
subtle differences in the synchronization levels of the awake-like state,
depending on the activation pathway.

1412.5026	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Sample and population exponents of generalized Taylor's law	"  Taylor's law (TL) states that the variance $V$ of a non-negative random
variable is a power function of its mean $M$, i.e. $V=a M^b$. The ubiquitous
empirical verification of TL, typically displaying sample exponents $b \simeq
2$, suggests a context-independent mechanism. However, theoretical studies of
population dynamics predict a broad range of values of $b$. Here, we explain
this apparent contradiction by using large deviations theory to derive a
generalized TL in terms of sample and populations exponents $b_{jk}$ for the
scaling of the $k$-th vs the $j$-th cumulant (conventional TL is recovered for
$b=b_{12}$), with the sample exponent found to depend predictably on the number
of observed samples. Thus, for finite numbers of observations one observes
sample exponents $b_{jk}\simeq k/j$ (thus $b\simeq2$) independently of
population exponents. Empirical analyses on two datasets support our
theoretical results.

1412.5323	q-bio	cs.NE q-bio.GN	"Gene Similarity-based Approaches for Determining Core-Genes of
  Chloroplasts"	"  In computational biology and bioinformatics, the manner to understand
evolution processes within various related organisms paid a lot of attention
these last decades. However, accurate methodologies are still needed to
discover genes content evolution. In a previous work, two novel approaches
based on sequence similarities and genes features have been proposed. More
precisely, we proposed to use genes names, sequence similarities, or both,
insured either from NCBI or from DOGMA annotation tools. Dogma has the
advantage to be an up-to-date accurate automatic tool specifically designed for
chloroplasts, whereas NCBI possesses high quality human curated genes (together
with wrongly annotated ones). The key idea of the former proposal was to take
the best from these two tools. However, the first proposal was limited by name
variations and spelling errors on the NCBI side, leading to core trees of low
quality. In this paper, these flaws are fixed by improving the comparison of
NCBI and DOGMA results, and by relaxing constraints on gene names while adding
a stage of post-validation on gene sequences. The two stages of similarity
measures, on names and sequences, are thus proposed for sequence clustering.
This improves results that can be obtained using either NCBI or DOGMA alone.
Results obtained with this quality control test are further investigated and
compared with previously released ones, on both computational and biological
aspects, considering a set of 99 chloroplastic genomes.

1412.5343	q-bio	physics.bio-ph cond-mat.soft cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.SC	Transport of organelles by elastically coupled motor proteins	"  Motor-driven cargo transport is a complex phenomenon where multiple motor
proteins attached on to a cargo engage in pulling activity, often leading to
tug-of-war, displaying bidirectional motion. However, most mathematical and
computational models ignore the details of the motor-cargo interaction. Here,
we study a generic model in which N motors are elastically coupled to a cargo,
which itself is subjected to thermal noise in the cytoplasm and to an
additional external applied force. The motor-hopping rates are chosen to
satisfy detailed balance with respect to the energy of elastic stretching. With
these assumptions, an (N+1)-variable master equation is constructed for
dynamics of the motor-cargo complex. By expanding the hopping rates to linear
order in fluctuations in motor positions, we obtain a linear Fokker-Planck
equation. The deterministic equations governing the average quantities are
separated out and explicit analytical expressions are obtained for the mean
velocity and diffusion coefficient of the cargo. We also study the statistical
features of the force experienced by an individual motor and quantitatively
characterize the load-sharing among the cargo-bound motors. The mean cargo
velocity and the effective diffusion coefficient are found to be decreasing
functions of the stiffness. While increase in the number of motors N does not
increase the velocity substantially, it decreases the effective diffusion
coefficient which falls as 1/N asymptotically. We further show that the
cargo-bound motors share the force exerted on the cargo equally only in the
limit of vanishing elastic stiffness; as stiffness is increased, deviations
from equal load sharing are observed. Numerical simulations agree with our
analytical results where expected. Interestingly, we find in simulations that
the stall force of a cargo elastically coupled to motors is independent of the
stiffness.

1412.5773	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"A general parameterized mathematical food web model that predicts a
  stable green world in the terrestrial ecosystem"	"  Terrestrial ecosystems are generally green and only a small part (<10%) of
the plant matter is consumed by herbivores annually,but the reason has been
unclear due to the lack of food web models for predicting the absolute
herbivore biomass in physical units. Here, I present a simple parameterized
mathematical food web model that can predict the biomass density of herbivores
h (kg protein/m3) and carnivores c from ecological factors such as the
nutritive values of plants np (kg protein/m3), herbivores nh, and carnivores
nc, searching efficiency (volume) of carnivores S (/day), eating efficiency
(speed) of herbivores eh (/day) and carnivores ec, respiratory decrease in
herbivore and carnivore biomasses, dh (/day) and dc, absorption efficiency of
herbivores and carnivores h (ratio) and c, and probabilities of carnivores
preying on herbivores or carnivores, Phc (ratio) and Pcc.The model predicts a
stable equilibrium with low herbivore biomass h sufficient to keep the world
green if the food web consists of the three trophic levels, plants, herbivores
and carnivores; intraguild predation of carnivores exists; np<nh,nc; S>>eh, and
Phc>Pcc >0,which are well-realized in above-ground terrestrial ecosystems where
plant-rich ""green world"" is common. The h and c calculated from our model
showed good agreement with those from empirical observations in forests, where
both h and c are ca. 100 mg (fresh biomass/m2), and in savannahs. The model
predicts that the nutritive values and digestibility of plants are positively
correlated with h and the intensity of herbivory, which theoretically explains
the out-door defensive effects of the anti-nutritive or quantitative defenses
(e.g., tannins, protease inhibitors) of plants, and predicts that c and c/h are
positively correlated with the relative growth rate of herbivores. The present
model introduced parameterized realities into food web theory.

1412.5955	q-bio	q-bio.SC	Accurate chromosome segregation by probabilistic self-organization	"  Background: For faithful chromosome segregation during cell division, correct
attachments must be established between sister chromosomes and microtubules
from opposite spindle poles through kinetochores (chromosome bi-orientation).
Incorrect attachments of kinetochore microtubules (kMTs) lead to chromosome
mis-segregation and aneuploidy, which is often associated with developmental
abnormalities such as Down syndrome and diseases including cancer. The
interaction between kinetochores and microtubules is highly dynamic with
frequent attachments and detachments. However, it remains unclear how
chromosome bi-orientation is achieved with such accuracy in such a dynamic
process.
  Results: To gain new insight into this essential process, we have developed a
simple mathematical model of kinetochore-microtubule interactions during cell
division in general, i.e. both mitosis and meiosis. Firstly, the model reveals
that the balance between attachment and detachment probabilities of kMTs is
crucial for correct chromosome bi-orientation. With the right balance,
incorrect attachments are resolved spontaneously into correct bi-oriented
conformations while an imbalance leads to persistent errors. In addition, the
model explains why errors are more commonly found in the first meiotic division
(meiosis I) than in mitosis and how a faulty conformation can evade the spindle
assembly checkpoint, which may lead to a chromosome loss.
  Conclusions: The proposed model, despite its simplicity, helps us understand
one of the primary causes of chromosomal instability - aberrant
kinetochore-microtubule interactions. The model reveals that chromosome
bi-orientation is a probabilistic self-organization, rather than a
sophisticated process of error detection and correction.

  Mutualism"	"  Game theory ideas provide a useful framework for studying evolutionary
dynamics in a well-mixed environment. This approach, however, typically
enforces a strictly fixed overall population size, deemphasizing natural growth
processes. We study a competitive Lotka-Volterra model, with number
fluctuations, that accounts for natural population growth and encompasses
interaction scenarios typical of evolutionary games. We show that, in an
appropriate limit, the model describes standard evolutionary games with both
genetic drift and overall population size fluctuations. However, there are also
regimes where a varying population size can strongly influence the evolutionary
dynamics. We focus on the strong mutualism scenario and demonstrate that
standard evolutionary game theory fails to describe our simulation results. We
then analytically and numerically determine fixation probabilities as well as
mean fixation times using matched asymptotic expansions, taking into account
the population size degree of freedom. These results elucidate the interplay
between population dynamics and evolutionary dynamics in well-mixed systems.

  general stochastic models"	"  Gene expression in individual cells is highly variable and sporadic, often
resulting in the synthesis of mRNAs and proteins in bursts. Bursting in gene
expression is known to impact cell-fate in diverse systems ranging from latency
in HIV-1 viral infections to cellular differentiation. It is generally assumed
that bursts are geometrically distributed and that they arrive according to a
Poisson process. On the other hand, recent single-cell experiments provide
evidence for complex burst arrival processes, highlighting the need for more
general stochastic models. To address this issue, we invoke a mapping between
general models of gene expression and systems studied in queueing theory to
derive exact analytical expressions for the moments associated with
mRNA/protein steady-state distributions. These moments are then used to derive
explicit conditions, based entirely on experimentally measurable quantities,
that determine if the burst distributions deviate from the geometric
distribution or if burst arrival deviates from a Poisson process. For
non-Poisson arrivals, we develop approaches for accurate estimation of burst
parameters.

individual velocities narrows around the mean velocity of the flock. We argue
that, in a broad class of models for the joint distribution of positions and
velocities, this narrowing generates an entropic force that opposes the
cohesion of the flock. The strength of this force depends strongly on the
nature of the interactions among birds: if birds are coupled to a fixed number
of neighbors, the entropic forces are weak, while if they couple to all other
birds within a fixed distance, the entropic forces are sufficient to tear a
flock apart. Similar entropic forces should occur in other non-equilibrium
systems. For the joint distribution of protein structures and amino-acid
sequences, these forces favor the occurrence of ""highly designable"" structures.

  than Men's"	"  Deep graph-theoretic ideas in the context with the graph of the World Wide
Web led to the definition of Google's PageRank and the subsequent rise of the
most-popular search engine to date. Brain graphs, or connectomes, are being
widely explored today. We believe that non-trivial graph theoretic concepts,
similarly as it happened in the case of the World Wide web, will lead to
discoveries enlightening the structural and also the functional details of the
animal and human brains. When scientists examine large networks of tens or
hundreds of millions of vertices, only fast algorithms can be applied because
of the size constraints. In the case of diffusion MRI-based structural human
brain imaging, the effective vertex number of the connectomes, or brain graphs
derived from the data is on the scale of several hundred today. That size
facilitates applying strict mathematical graph algorithms even for some
hard-to-compute (or NP-hard) quantities like vertex cover or balanced minimum
cut. In the present work we have examined brain graphs, computed from the data
of the Human Connectome Project, recorded from male and female subjects between
ages 22 and 35. Significant differences were found between the male and female
structural brain graphs: we show that the average female connectome has more
edges, is a better expander graph, has larger minimal bisection width, and has
more spanning trees than the average male connectome. Since the average female
brain weights less than the brain of males, these properties show that the
female brain is more ""well-connected"" or perhaps, more ""efficient"" in a sense
than the brain of males.

1501.01085	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"The effect of the dispersal kernel on isolation-by-distance in a
  continuous population"	"  Under models of isolation-by-distance, population structure is determined by
the probability of identity-by-descent between pairs of genes according to the
geographic distance between them. Well established analytical results indicate
that the relationship between geographical and genetic distance depends mostly
on the neighborhood size of the population, $N_b = 4{\pi}{\sigma}^2 D_e$, which
represents a standardized measure of dispersal. To test this prediction, we
model local dispersal of haploid individuals on a two-dimensional torus using
four dispersal kernels: Rayleigh, exponential, half-normal and triangular. When
neighborhood size is held constant, the distributions produce similar patterns
of isolation-by-distance, confirming predictions. Considering this, we propose
that the triangular distribution is the appropriate null distribution for
isolation-by-distance studies. Under the triangular distribution, dispersal is
uniform within an area of $4{\pi}{\sigma}^2$ (i.e. the neighborhood area),
which suggests that the common description of neighborhood size as a measure of
a local panmictic population is valid for popular families of dispersal
distributions. We further show how to draw from the triangular distribution
efficiently and argue that it should be utilized in other studies in which
computational efficiency is important

German-learning infants\^a audio--visual matching ability of German and French
fluent speech was assessed by using a variant of the intermodal matching

In Experiment 1, the sentences were spoken in an adult-directed (AD) manner.
Results showed that 12-month-old infants did not exhibit a matching performance

that when ID speech stimuli were used, infants did perceive the relation
between auditory and visual speech attributes, but only in response to their
native language. Thus, the findings suggest that ID speech might have an
influence on the intersensory perception of fluent speech and shed further
light on multisensory perceptual narrowing.

neurite outgrowth. Aligned nanofibers were created according to a mathematical
model and were shown to enable significant control over the direction of
neurite outgrowth in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)

hydrogels enabled significant alignment of neurites with nanofibers, enabled
significant neurite tracking of nanofibers, and significantly increased the
distance over which neurites could extend. This work demonstrates the ability
to create unique 3D neural tissue constructs using a combined system of
hydrogel and nanofiber scaffolding. Importantly, patterned and
biofunctionalized nanofiber scaffolds that can control direction and increase
length of neurite outgrowth in three-dimensions hold much potential for neural

in their environment. We hypothesized that the amount of transcriptome change
is proportional to the amount of environmental change. To capture the effects
of environmental changes on the transcriptome, we compared transcriptome
diversities (defined as the Shannon entropy of frequency distribution) of
silkworm fat-body tissues cultured with several concentrations of
phenobarbital. Although there was no proportional relationship, we did identify
a drug concentration tipping point between 0.25 and 1.0 mM. Cells cultured in
media containing lower drug concentrations than the tipping point showed
uniformly high transcriptome diversities, while those cultured at higher drug
concentrations than the tipping point showed uniformly low transcriptome
diversities. The plasticity of transcriptome diversity was corroborated by
cultivations of fat bodies in MGM-450 insect medium without phenobarbital and
in 0.25 mM phenobarbital-supplemented MGM-450 insect medium after previous
cultivation (cultivation for 80 hours in MGM-450 insect medium without
phenobarbital, followed by cultivation for 10 hours in 1.0 mM
phenobarbital-supplemented MGM-450 insect medium). Interestingly, the
transcriptome diversities of cells cultured in media containing 0.25 mM
phenobarbital after previous cultivation (cultivation for 80 hours in MGM-450
insect medium without phenobarbital, followed by cultivation for 10 hours in
1.0 mM phenobarbital-supplemented MGM-450 insect medium) were different from
cells cultured in media containing 0.25 mM phenobarbital after previous
cultivation (cultivation for 80 hours in MGM-450 insect medium without
phenobarbital). This hysteretic phenomenon of transcriptome diversities
indicates multi-stability of the genome expression system.

  when loci have unequal effects"	"  We consider an infinitely large population under stabilising selection and
mutation in which the allelic effects determining a polygenic trait vary
between loci. We obtain analytical expressions for the stationary genetic
variance as a function of the distribution of effects, mutation rate and
selection coefficient. We also study the dynamics of the allele frequencies,
focussing on short-term evolution of the phenotypic mean as it approaches the
optimum after an environmental change. We find that when most effects are
small, the genetic variance does not change appreciably during adaptation, and
the time until the phenotypic mean reaches the optimum is short if the number
of loci is large. However, when most effects are large, the change of the
variance during the adaptive process cannot be neglected. In this case, the
short-term dynamics may be described by that of a single locus of large effect.
Our results may be used to understand polygenic selection driving rapid
adaptation.

  the aortic root"	"  It has long been recognized that aortic root elasticity helps to ensure
efficient aortic valve closure, but our understanding of the functional
importance of the elasticity and geometry of the aortic root continues to
evolve as increasingly detailed in vivo imaging data become available. Herein,
we describe fluid-structure interaction models of the aortic root, including
the aortic valve leaflets, the sinuses of Valsalva, the aortic annulus, and the
sinotubular junction, that employ a version of Peskin's immersed boundary (IB)
method with a finite element (FE) description of the structural elasticity. We
develop both an idealized model of the root with three-fold symmetry of the
aortic sinuses and valve leaflets, and a more realistic model that accounts for
the differences in the sizes of the left, right, and noncoronary sinuses and
corresponding valve cusps. As in earlier work, we use fiber-based models of the
valve leaflets, but this study extends earlier IB models of the aortic root by
employing incompressible hyperelastic models of the mechanics of the sinuses
and ascending aorta using a constitutive law fit to experimental data from
human aortic root tissue. In vivo pressure loading is accounted for by a
backwards displacement method that determines the unloaded configurations of
the root models. Our models yield realistic cardiac output at physiological
pressures, with low transvalvular pressure differences during forward flow,
minimal regurgitation during valve closure, and realistic pressure loads when
the valve is closed during diastole. Further, results from high-resolution
computations demonstrate that IB models of the aortic valve are able to produce
essentially grid-converged dynamics at practical grid spacings for the
high-Reynolds number flows of the aortic root.

on distributions of the three tree distances between two random unrooted trees
with $n$ leaves ($n \geq 4$); and then we focus on the distributions the three

these distributions.

  phosphate through post-nucleation shielding by Fetuin-A"	"  In vertebrates, insufficient availability of calcium and phosphate ions in
extracellular fluids leads to loss of bone density and neuronal
hyper-excitability. To counteract this problem, calcium ions are present at
high concentrations throughout body fluids -- at concentrations exceeding the
saturation point. This condition leads to the opposite situation where unwanted
mineral sedimentation may occur. Remarkably, ectopic or out-of-place
sedimentation into soft tissues is rare, in spite of the thermodynamic driving
factors. This fortunate fact is due to the presence of auto-regulatory proteins
that are found in abundance in bodily fluids. Yet, many important inflammatory
disorders such as atherosclerosis and osteoarthritis are associated with this
undesired calcification. Hence, it is important to gain an understanding of the
regulatory process and the conditions under which it can go awry. In this
manuscript, we adapt mean-field classical nucleation theory to the case of
surface-shielding in order to study the regulation of sedimentation of calcium
phosphate salts in biological tissues through the mechanism of post-nuclear
shielding of nascent mineral particles by binding proteins. We develop a
mathematical description of this phenomenon using a countable system of
hyperbolic partial differential equations. A critical concentration of
regulatory protein is identified as a function of the physical parameters that

1501.02883	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio.SC	Mechanics of torque generation in the bacterial flagellar motor	"  The bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) is responsible for driving bacterial
locomotion and chemotaxis, fundamental processes in pathogenesis and biofilm
formation. In the BFM, torque is generated at the interface between
transmembrane proteins (stators) and a rotor. It is well-established that the
passage of ions down a transmembrane gradient through the stator complex
provides the energy needed for torque generation. However, the physics involved
in this energy conversion remain poorly understood. Here we propose a
mechanically specific model for torque generation in the BFM. In particular, we
identify two fundamental forces involved in torque generation: electrostatic
and steric. We propose that electrostatic forces serve to position the stator,
while steric forces comprise the actual 'power stroke'. Specifically, we
predict that ion-induced conformational changes about a proline 'hinge' residue
in an $\alpha$-helix of the stator are directly responsible for generating the
power stroke. Our model predictions fit well with recent experiments on a
single-stator motor. Furthermore, we propose several experiments to elucidate
the torque-speed relationship in motors where the number of stators may not be
constant. The proposed model provides a mechanical explanation for several
fundamental features of the flagellar motor, including: torque-speed and
speed-ion motive force relationships, backstepping, variation in step sizes,
and the puzzle of swarming experiments.

  differences in experience"	"  Normal anxiety is considered an adaptive response to the possible presence of
danger, but is susceptible to dysregulation. Anxiety disorders are prevalent at
high frequency in contemporary human societies, yet impose substantial
disability upon their sufferers. This raises a puzzle: why has evolution left
us vulnerable to anxiety disorders? We develop a signal detection model in
which individuals must learn how to calibrate their anxiety responses: they
need to learn which cues indicate danger in the environment. We derive the
optimal strategy for doing so, and find that individuals face an inevitable
exploration-exploitation tradeoff between obtaining a better estimate of the
level of risk on one hand, and maximizing current payoffs on the other. Because
of this tradeoff, a subset of the population can become trapped in a state of
self-perpetuating over-sensitivity to threatening stimuli, even when
individuals learn optimally. This phenomenon arises because when individuals
become too cautious, they stop sampling the environment and fail to correct
their misperceptions, whereas when individuals become too careless they
continue to sample the environment and soon discover their mistakes. Thus,
over-sensitivity to threats becomes common whereas under-sensitivity becomes
rare. We suggest that this process may be involved in the development of
excessive anxiety in humans.

1501.03209	q-bio	cs.NE q-bio.NC	Neural Implementation of Probabilistic Models of Cognition	"  Bayesian models of cognition hypothesize that human brains make sense of data
by representing probability distributions and applying Bayes' rule to find the
best explanation for available data. Understanding the neural mechanisms
underlying probabilistic models remains important because Bayesian models
provide a computational framework, rather than specifying mechanistic
processes. Here, we propose a deterministic neural-network model which
estimates and represents probability distributions from observable events --- a
phenomenon related to the concept of probability matching. Our model learns to
represent probabilities without receiving any representation of them from the
external world, but rather by experiencing the occurrence patterns of
individual events. Our neural implementation of probability matching is paired
with a neural module applying Bayes' rule, forming a comprehensive neural
scheme to simulate human Bayesian learning and inference. Our model also
provides novel explanations of base-rate neglect, a notable deviation from
Bayes.

1501.03250	q-bio	math.PR q-bio.PE	"An elementary proof of convergence to the mean-field equations for an
  epidemic model"	"  It is common to use a compartmental, fluid model described by a system of
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model disease spread. In addition to
their simplicity, these models are also the mean-field approximations of more
accurate stochastic models of disease spread on contact networks. For the
simplest case of a stochastic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) process
(infection with recovery) on a complete network, it has been shown that the
fraction of infected nodes converges to the mean-field ODE as the number of
nodes increases. However the proofs are not simple, requiring sophisticated
probability, partial differential equations (PDE), or infinite systems of ODEs.
We provide a short proof in this case for convergence in mean-square on finite
time-intervals using a system of two ODEs and a moment inequality and also
obtain the first lower bound on the expected fraction of infected nodes.

1501.03632	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Fixation probability of rare nonmutator and evolution of mutation rates	"  Although mutations drive the evolutionary process, the rates at which the
mutations occur are themselves subject to evolutionary forces. Our purpose here
is to understand the role of selection and random genetic drift in the
evolution of mutation rates, and we address this question in asexual
populations at mutation-selection equilibrium neglecting selective sweeps.
Using a multitype branching process, we calculate the fixation probability of a
rare nonmutator in a large asexual population of mutators, and find that a
nonmutator is more likely to fix when the deleterious mutation rate of the
mutator population is high. Compensatory mutations in the mutator population
are found to decrease the fixation probability of a nonmutator when the
selection coefficient is large. But, surprisingly, the fixation probability
changes nonmonotonically with increasing compensatory mutation rate when the
selection is mild. Using these results for the fixation probability and a
drift-barrier argument, we find a novel relationship between the mutation rates
and the population size. We also discuss the time to fix the nonmutator in an
adapted population of asexual mutators, and compare our results with
experiments.

progress and inheritable superiority. Besides, coevolutionary dynamics is
characterized by interactions yielding subjective fitness, but aiming at
solutions that are superior with respect to an objective measurement. Such an
approximation of objective fitness may be, for instance, generalization
performance. In the paper a link between rating-- and ranking--based measures
of intransitivity and fitness landscapes that can address the dichotomy between
subjective and objective fitness is explored. The approach is illustrated by
numerical experiments involving a simple random game with continuously tunable
degree of randomness.

  of the Smoluchowski equation using smooth particle hydrodynamics"	"  Background. The calculation of diffusion-controlled ligand binding rates is
important for understanding enzyme mechanisms as well as designing enzyme
inhibitors. We demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of a Lagrangian
particle-based method, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), to study
diffusion in biomolecular systems by numerically solving the time-dependent
Smoluchowski equation for continuum diffusion.
  Results. The numerical method is first verified in simple systems and then
applied to the calculation of ligand binding to an acetylcholinesterase
monomer. Unlike previous studies, a reactive Robin boundary condition (BC),
rather than the absolute absorbing (Dirichlet) boundary condition, is
considered on the reactive boundaries. This new boundary condition treatment
allows for the analysis of enzymes with ""imperfect"" reaction rates. Rates for
inhibitor binding to mAChE are calculated at various ionic strengths and
compared with experiment and other numerical methods. We find that imposition
of the Robin BC improves agreement between calculated and experimental reaction
rates.
  Conclusions. Although this initial application focuses on a single monomer
system, our new method provides a framework to explore broader applications of
SPH in larger-scale biomolecular complexes by taking advantage of its
Lagrangian particle-based nature.

1501.04260	q-bio	cs.SY cs.SI q-bio.PE	Disease spread over randomly switched large-scale networks	"  In this paper we study disease spread over a randomly switched network, which
is modeled by a stochastic switched differential equation based on the so
called $N$-intertwined model for disease spread over static networks. Assuming
that all the edges of the network are independently switched, we present
sufficient conditions for the convergence of infection probability to zero.
Though the stability theory for switched linear systems can naively derive a
necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence, the condition cannot be
used for large-scale networks because, for a network with $n$ agents, it
requires computing the maximum real eigenvalue of a matrix of size exponential
in $n$. On the other hand, our conditions that are based also on the spectral
theory of random matrices can be checked by computing the maximum real
eigenvalue of a matrix of size exactly $n$.

1501.04648	q-bio	q-bio.BM	Fast, approximate kinetics of RNA folding	"  In this paper, we introduce the software suite, Hermes, which provides fast,
novel algorithms for RNA secondary structure kinetics. Using the fast Fourier
transform to efficiently compute the Boltzmann probability that a secondary
structure S of a given RNA sequence has base pair distance x [resp. y] from
reference structure A [resp. B], Hermes computes the exact kinetics of folding
from A to B in this coarse-grained model. In particular, Hermes computes the
mean first passage time from the transition probability matrix by using matrix
inversion, and also computes the equilibrium time from the rate matrix by using
spectral decomposition. Due to the model granularity and the speed of Hermes,
it is capable of determining secondary structure refolding kinetics for large
RNA sequences, beyond the range of other methods. Comparative benchmarking of
Hermes with other methods indicates that Hermes provides refolding kinetics of
accuracy suitable for use in computational design of RNA, an important area of
synthetic biology. Source code and documentation for Hermes are available at

quantum mechanics, have been developed in decision theory and cognitive
sciences to account for seemingly irrational or paradoxical human judgments. We
consider here some such quantum-like models that address question order
effects, i.e. cases in which given answers depend on the order of presentation
of the questions. Models of various dimensionalities could be used, can the
simplest ones be empirically adequate? From the quantum law of reciprocity, we
derive new empirical predictions that we call the Grand Reciprocity equations,
that must be satisfied by several existing quantum-like models, in their
non-degenerate versions. Using substantial existing data sets, we show that
these non-degenerate versions fail the GR test in most cases, which means that,
if quantum-like models of the kind considered here are to work, it can only be
in their degenerate versions. However, we suggest that the route of degenerate
models is not necessarily an easy one, and we argue for more research on the
empirical adequacy of degenerate quantum-like models in general.

1501.05194	q-bio	stat.ML cs.LG q-bio.QM	"A Bayesian alternative to mutual information for the hierarchical
  clustering of dependent random variables"	"  The use of mutual information as a similarity measure in agglomerative
hierarchical clustering (AHC) raises an important issue: some correction needs
to be applied for the dimensionality of variables. In this work, we formulate
the decision of merging dependent multivariate normal variables in an AHC
procedure as a Bayesian model comparison. We found that the Bayesian
formulation naturally shrinks the empirical covariance matrix towards a matrix
set a priori (e.g., the identity), provides an automated stopping rule, and
corrects for dimensionality using a term that scales up the measure as a
function of the dimensionality of the variables. Also, the resulting log Bayes
factor is asymptotically proportional to the plug-in estimate of mutual
information, with an additive correction for dimensionality in agreement with
the Bayesian information criterion. We investigated the behavior of these
Bayesian alternatives (in exact and asymptotic forms) to mutual information on
simulated and real data. An encouraging result was first derived on
simulations: the hierarchical clustering based on the log Bayes factor
outperformed off-the-shelf clustering techniques as well as raw and normalized
mutual information in terms of classification accuracy. On a toy example, we
found that the Bayesian approaches led to results that were similar to those of
mutual information clustering techniques, with the advantage of an automated
thresholding. On real functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets
measuring brain activity, it identified clusters consistent with the
established outcome of standard procedures. On this application, normalized
mutual information had a highly atypical behavior, in the sense that it
systematically favored very large clusters. These initial experiments suggest
that the proposed Bayesian alternatives to mutual information are a useful new
tool for hierarchical clustering.

1501.05880	q-bio	q-bio.QM	"Revisiting resource selection probability functions and single-visit
  methods: Clarification and extensions"	"  Models accounting for imperfect detection are important. Single-visit methods
have been proposed as an alternative to multiple-visits methods to relax the
assumption of closed population. Knape and Korner-Nievergelt (2015) showed that
under certain models of probability of detection single-visit methods are
statistically non-identifiable leading to biased population estimates. There is
a close relationship between estimation of the resource selection probability
function (RSPF) using weighted distributions and single-visit methods for
occupancy and abundance estimation. We explain the precise mathematical
conditions needed for RSPF estimation as stated in Lele and Keim (2006). The
identical conditions, that remained unstated in our papers on single-visit
methodology, are needed for single-visit methodology to work. We show that the
class of admissible models is quite broad and does not excessively restrict the
application of the RSPF or the single-visit methodology. To complement the work
by Knape and Korner-Nievergelt, we study the performance of multiple-visit
methods under the scaled logistic detection function and a much wider set of
situations. In general, under the scaled logistic detection function
multiple-visits methods also lead to biased estimates. As a solution to this
problem, we extend the single-visit methodology to a class of models that
allows use of scaled probability function. We propose a Multinomial extension
of single visit methodology that can be used to check whether the detection
function satisfies the RSPF condition or not. Furthermore, we show that if the
scaling factor depends on covariates, then it can also be estimated.

1501.06031	q-bio	stat.AP math.NA q-bio.NC	"From dynamics to links: a sparse reconstruction of the topology of a
  neural network"	"  One major challenge in neuroscience is the identification of interrelations
between signals reflecting neural activity and how information processing
occurs in the neural circuits. At the cellular and molecular level, mechanisms
of signal transduction have been studied intensively and a better knowledge and
understanding of some basic processes of information handling by neurons has
been achieved. In contrast, little is known about the organization and function
of complex neuronal networks. Experimental methods are now available to
simultaneously monitor electrical activity of a large number of neurons in real
time. Then, the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the spiking activity
of individual neurons is a very valuable tool for the study of the dynamics and
architecture of the neural networks. Such activity is not due to the sole
intrinsic properties of the individual neural cells but it is mostly
consequence of the direct influence of other neurons. The deduction of the
effective connectivity between neurons, whose experimental spike trains are
observed, is of crucial importance in neuroscience: first for the correct
interpretation of the electro-physiological activity of the involved neurons
and neural networks, and, for correctly relating the electrophysiological
activity to the functional tasks accomplished by the network. In this work we
propose a novel method for the identification of connectivity of neural
networks using recorded voltages. Our approach is based on the assumption that
the network has a topology with sparse connections. After a brief description
of our method we will report the performances and compare it to the
cross-correlation computed on the spike trains, that represents a gold standard
method in the field.

1501.06149	q-bio	q-bio.QM stat.AP	"Closed-form stochastic solutions for non-equilibrium dynamics and
  inheritance of cellular components over many cell divisions"	"  Stochastic dynamics govern many important processes in cellular biology, and
an underlying theoretical approach describing these dynamics is desirable to
address a wealth of questions in biology and medicine. Mathematical tools exist
for treating several important examples of these stochastic processes, most
notably gene expression, and random partitioning at single cell divisions or
after a steady state has been reached. Comparatively little work exists
exploring different and specific ways that repeated cell divisions can lead to
stochastic inheritance of unequilibrated cellular populations. Here we
introduce a mathematical formalism to describe cellular agents that are subject
to random creation, replication, and/or degradation, and are inherited
according to a range of random dynamics at cell divisions. We obtain
closed-form generating functions describing systems at any time after any
number of cell divisions for binomial partitioning and divisions provoking a
deterministic or random, subtractive or additive change in copy number, and
show that these solutions agree exactly with stochastic simulation. We apply
this general formalism to several example problems involving the dynamics of
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) during development and organismal lifetimes.

networks. With advances in high resolution microscopy, the spatial location of
different signaling molecules and the spatio-temporal dynamics of signaling
microdomains are now widely acknowledged as key features of biochemical signal
transduction. Reaction-diffusion mechanisms are commonly used to model such
features, often with a heavy reliance on numerical simulations to obtain
results. However, simulations are parameter dependent and may not be able to
provide an understanding of the full range of the system responses. Analytical
approaches on the other hand provide a framework to study the entire phase
space. In this tutorial, we provide a largely analytical method for studying
reaction-diffusion models and analyzing their stability properties. Using two
representative biological examples, we demonstrate how this approach can guide
experimental design.

1501.07342	q-bio	q-bio.MN	"Only accessible information is useful: insights from gradient-mediated
  patterning"	"  Information theory is gaining popularity as a tool to characterize
performance of biological systems. However, information is commonly quantified
without reference to whether or how a system could extract and use it; as a
result, information-theoretic quantities are easily misinterpreted. Here we
take the example of pattern-forming developmental systems which are commonly
structured as cascades of sequential gene expression steps. Such a multi-tiered
structure appears to constitute sub-optimal use of the positional information
provided by the input morphogen because noise is added at each tier. However,
the conventional theory fails to distinguish between the total information in a
morphogen and information that can be usefully extracted and interpreted by
downstream elements. We demonstrate that quantifying the information that is
_accessible_ to the system naturally explains the prevalence of multi-tiered
network architectures as a consequence of the noise inherent to the control of
gene expression. We support our argument with empirical observations from
patterning along the major body axis of the fruit fly embryo. Our results
exhibit the limitations of the standard information-theoretic characterization
of biological signaling and illustrate how they can be resolved.

reversal allele for various population sizes, $N$, sequence lengths, $L$,
selective advantages, $s$, fitness parameters, $k$, and measuring parameters,
$C$, were calculated in an asymmetric sharply-peaked landscape using the
decoupled continuous-time mutation-selection model. The growing probability in
the stochastic region was inversely proportional to the measuring parameter
when $C<1/Ns^*$, bent when $C\approx 1/Ns^*$ and became saturated when
$C>1/Ns^*$, where $s^*$ is the effective selective advantage. The saturated
growing probability in the stochastic region was approximately the effective
selective advantage when $C\gg 1/Ns^*$ and $s^*\ll 1$. The present study
suggests that the growing probability in the stochastic region in an asymmetric
sharply-peaked landscape in the decoupled continuous-time mutation-selection
model can be described using the theoretical formula for the growing
probability in the Moran two-allele model. The selective advantage ratio, which
represents the ratio of the effective selective advantage to the selective
advantage, does not depend on the population size, selective advantage,
measuring parameter, and fitness parameter; instead the selective advantage
ratio decreases with increasing the sequence length.

mutations - is essential for understanding the relationship of genotype,
phenotype, and fitness in biological systems. The applications cover many areas
of biological research, including biochemistry, genomics, protein and systems
engineering, medicine, and evolutionary biology. However, the quantitative
definitions of epistasis vary among fields, and its analysis beyond just
pairwise effects remains obscure in general. Here, we show that different
definitions of epistasis are versions of a single mathematical formalism - the
weighted Walsh-Hadamard transform. We discuss that one of the definitions, the
backgound-averaged epistasis, is the most informative when the goal is to
uncover the general epistatic structure of a biological system, a description
that can be rather different from the local epistatic structure of specific
model systems. Key issues are the choice of effective ensembles for averaging
and to practically contend with the vast combinatorial complexity of mutations.
In this regard, we discuss possible approaches for optimally learning the
epistatic structure of biological systems.

  representational geometry of monkey face patches"	"  Ample evidence suggests that face processing in human and non-human primates
is performed differently compared with other objects. Converging reports, both
physiologically and psychophysically, indicate that faces are processed in
specialized neural networks in the brain -i.e. face patches in monkeys and the
fusiform face area (FFA) in humans. We are all expert face-processing agents,
and able to identify very subtle differences within the category of faces,
despite substantial visual and featural similarities. Identification is
performed rapidly and accurately after viewing a whole face, while
significantly drops if some of the face configurations (e.g. inversion,
misalignment) are manipulated or if partial views of faces are shown due to
occlusion. This refers to a hotly-debated, yet highly-supported concept, known
as holistic face processing. We built a hierarchical computational model of
face-processing based on evidence from recent neuronal and behavioural studies
on faces processing in primates. Representational geometries of the last three
layers of the model have characteristics similar to those observed in monkey
face patches (posterior, middle and anterior patches). Furthermore, several
face-processing-related phenomena reported in the literature automatically
emerge as properties of this model. The representations are evolved through
several computational layers, using biologically plausible learning rules. The
model satisfies face inversion effect, composite face effect, other race
effect, view and identity selectivity, and canonical face views. To our
knowledge, no models have so far been proposed with this performance and
agreement with biological data.

1502.01765	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio.SC	"Endocytic proteins drive vesicle growth via instability in high membrane
  tension environment"	"  Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a key pathway for transporting cargo
into cells via membrane vesicles. It plays an integral role in nutrient import,
signal transduction, neurotransmission and cellular entry of pathogens and
drug-carrying nanoparticles. As CME entails substantial local remodeling of the
plasma membrane, the presence of membrane tension offers resistance to bending
and hence, vesicle formation. Experiments show that in such high tension
conditions, actin dynamics is required to carry out CME successfully. In this
study, we build upon these pioneering experimental studies to provide
fundamental mechanistic insights into the roles of two key endocytic proteins,
namely, actin and BAR proteins in driving vesicle formation in high membrane
tension environment. Our study reveals a new actin force induced `snap-through
instability' that triggers a rapid shape transition from a shallow invagination
to a highly invaginated tubular structure. We show that the association of BAR
proteins stabilizes vesicles and induces a milder instability. In addition, we
present a new counterintuitive role of BAR depolymerization in regulating the
shape evolution of vesicles. We show that the dissociation of BAR proteins,
supported by actin-BAR synergy, leads to considerable elongation and squeezing
of vesicles. Going beyond the membrane geometry, we put forth a new
stress-based perspective for the onset of vesicle scission and predict the
shapes and composition of detached vesicles. We present the snap-through
transition and the high in-plane stress as possible explanations for the
intriguing direct transformation of broad and shallow invaginations into
detached vesicles in BAR mutant yeast cells.

  Structures: A Joint Theory-experiment Study"	"  The functions and elasticities of the cell are largely related to the
structures of the cytoskeletons underlying the lipid bi-layer. Among various
cell types, the Red Blood Cell (RBC) possesses a relatively simple cytoskeletal
structure. Underneath the membrane, the RBC cytoskeleton takes the form of a
two dimensional triangular network, consisting of nodes of actins (and other
proteins) and edges of spectrins. Recent experiments focusing on the malaria
infected RBCs (iRBCs) showed that there is a correlation between the elongation
of spectrins in the cytoskeletal network and the stiffening of the iRBCs. Here
we rationalize the correlation between these two observations by combining the
worm-like chain (WLC) model for single spectrins and the Effective Medium
Theory (EMT) for the network elasticity. We specifically focus on how the
disorders in the cytoskeletal network affect its macroscopic elasticity.
Analytical and numerical solutions from our model reveal that the stiffness of
the membrane increases with increasing end-to-end distances of spectrins, but
has a non-monotonic dependence on the variance of the end-to-end distance
distributions. These predictions are verified quantitively by our AFM and
micropipette aspiration measurements of iRBCs. The model may, from a molecular
level, provide guidelines for future identification of new treatment methods
for RBC related diseases, such as malaria infection.

functionality. We also infer statistical properties of the somatic
hypermutation machinery (exclusive of subsequent effects of selection). Our
main results are the following: the B-cell repertoire is substantially more
diverse than T-cell repertoires, due to longer junctional insertions; sequences
that pass initial selection are distinguished by having a higher probability of
being generated in a VDJ recombination event; somatic hypermutations have a
non-uniform distribution along the V gene that is well explained by an

reconstructed by ViPRA. We evaluate and compare MLEHaplo on simulated datasets
of 1200 base pairs at different sequence coverage, on HCV strains with
sequencing errors, and on a lab mixture of five HIV-1 strains. MLEHaplo
reconstructs full length viral haplotypes having a 100% sequence identity to
the true viral haplotypes in most of the small genome simulated viral
populations at 250x sequencing coverage. While reference based methods either
under-estimate or over-estimate the viral haplotypes, MLEHaplo limits the
over-estimation to 3 times the size of true viral haplotypes, reconstructs the
full phylogeny in the HCV to greater than 99% sequencing identity and captures
more sequencing variation for the HIV-1 strains dataset compared to their known

an initial configuration with $n$ agents each in an identical state, with
probability 1 it reaches a configuration $\mathbf{y}$ that is correct (exactly
one agent is in a special leader state $\ell$) and stable (every configuration
reachable from $\mathbf{y}$ also has a single agent in state $\ell$). We show
that any population protocol that stably elects a leader requires $\Omega(n)$
expected ""parallel time"" --- $\Omega(n^2)$ expected total pairwise interactions
--- to reach such a stable configuration. Our result also informs the
understanding of the time complexity of chemical self-organization by showing
an essential difficulty in generating exact quantities of molecular species
quickly.

and propagation fail- ure of the action potential in spatially extended,
conductance-based neuronal models subject to channel noise, based on
statistical properties of the membrane potential. We compare different
estimators with respect to the quality of detection, computational costs and
robustness and propose the integral of the membrane potential along the axon as
an appropriate estimator to detect both spontaneous activity and propagation
failure. Performing a model reduction we achieve a simplified analytical
expression based on the linearization at the resting potential (resp. the
traveling action potential). This allows to approximate the probabilities for
spontaneous activity and propagation failure in terms of (classical) hitting
probabilities of one-dimensional linear stochastic differential equations. The
quality of the approximation with respect to the noise amplitude is discussed
and illustrated with numerical results for the spatially extended
Hodgkin-Huxley.

  Gompertz law"	"  Although accumulation of molecular damage is suggested to be an important
molecular mechanism of aging, a quantitative link between the dynamics of
damage accumulation and mortality of species has so far remained elusive. To
address this question, we examine stability properties of a generic gene
regulatory network (GRN) and demonstrate that many characteristics of aging and
the associated population mortality rate emerge as inherent properties of the
critical dynamics of gene regulation and metabolic levels. Based on the
analysis of age-dependent changes in gene-expression and metabolic profiles in
Drosophila melanogaster, we explicitly show that the underlying GRNs are nearly
critical and inherently unstable. This instability manifests itself as aging in
the form of distortion of gene expression and metabolic profiles with age, and
causes the characteristic increase in mortality rate with age as described by a
form of the Gompertz law. In addition, we explain late-life mortality
deceleration observed at very late ages for large populations. We show that
aging contains a stochastic component, related to accumulation of regulatory
errors in transcription/translation/metabolic pathways due to imperfection of
signaling cascades in the network and of responses to environmental factors. We
also establish that there is a strong deterministic component, suggesting
genetic control. Since mortality in humans, where it is characterized best, is
strongly associated with the incidence of age-related diseases, our findings
support the idea that aging is the driving force behind the development of
chronic human diseases.

  Cortical Fluctuations"	"  For more than a century, cerebral cartography has been driven by
investigations of structural and morphological properties of the brain across
spatial scales and the temporal/functional phenomena that emerge from these
underlying features. The next era of brain mapping will be driven by studies
that consider both of these components of brain organization simultaneously --
elucidating their interactions and dependencies. Using this guiding principle,
we explored the origin of slowly fluctuating patterns of synchronization within
the topological core of brain regions known as the rich club, implicated in the
regulation of mood and introspection. We find that a constellation of densely
interconnected regions that constitute the rich club (including the anterior
insula, amygdala, and precuneus) play a central role in promoting a stable,
dynamical core of spontaneous activity in the primate cortex. The slow time
scales are well matched to the regulation of internal visceral states,
corresponding to the somatic correlates of mood and anxiety. In contrast, the
topology of the surrounding ""feeder"" cortical regions show unstable, rapidly
fluctuating dynamics likely crucial for fast perceptual processes. We discuss
these findings in relation to psychiatric disorders and the future of
connectomics.

  up read mapping"	"  Background: Identifying all possible mapping locations of next-generation
sequencing (NGS) reads is highly essential in several applications such as
prediction of genomic variants or protein binding motifs located in repeat
regions, isoform expression quantification, metagenomics analysis, etc.
However, this task is very time-consuming and majority of mapping tools only
focus on one or a few best mapping locations. Results: We propose AMAS, an
alignment tool specialized in identifying all possible mapping locations of NGS
reads in a reference sequence. AMAS features an effective use of adaptive seeds
to speed up read mapping while preserving sensitivity. Specifically, an index
is designed to pre-store the locations of adaptive seeds in the reference
sequence, efficiently reducing the time for seed matching and partitioning. An
accurate filtration of adaptive seeds is further applied to substantially
tighten the candidate alignment space. As a result, AMAS runs several times
faster than other state-of-the-art read mappers while achieving similar
accuracy. Conclusions: AMAS provides a valuable resource to speed up the
important yet time-consuming task of identifying all mapping locations of NGS
reads. AMAS is implemented in C++ based on the SeqAn library and is freely
available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngsamas/. Keywords:

of the most pressing challenges in genomics. Recently, it has been shown that
read pairs generated by proximity ligation of DNA in chromatin of living tissue
can address this problem. These data dramatically increase the scaffold
contiguity of assemblies and provide haplotype phasing information. Here, we
describe a simpler approach (""Chicago"") based on in vitro reconstituted
chromatin. We generated two Chicago datasets with human DNA and used a new
software pipeline (""HiRise"") to construct a highly accurate de novo assembly
and scaffolding of a human genome with scaffold N50 of 30 Mb. We also
demonstrated the utility of Chicago for improving existing assemblies by
re-assembling and scaffolding the genome of the American alligator. With a
single library and one lane of Illumina HiSeq sequencing, we increased the
scaffold N50 of the American alligator from 508 kb to 10 Mb. Our method uses
established molecular biology procedures and can be used to analyze any genome,
as it requires only about 5 micrograms of DNA as the starting material.

1502.05508	q-bio	q-bio.PE	The biased evolution of generation time	"  Many life-history traits, like the age at maturity or adult longevity, are
important determinants of the generation time. For instance, semelparous
species whose adults reproduce once and die have shorter generation times than
iteroparous species that reproduce on several occasions. A shorter generation
time ensures a higher growth rate in stable environments where resources are in
excess, and is therefore a positively selected feature in this (rarely met)
situation. In a stable and limiting environment, all combination of traits (or
strategies) that produce the same number of viable offspring on average are
strictly neutral even when their generation times differ. We first study the
evolution of life-history strategies with different generation times in this
context, and show that those with the longest generation time represent the
most likely evolutionary outcomes. Indeed, strategies with longer generation
times generate fewer mutants per time unit, which makes them less likely to be
replaced within a given time period. This `turnover bias' inevitably exists and
favors the evolution of strategies with long generation times. Its real impact,
however, should depend on the strength and direction of other evolutionary
forces; selection for short generation times, for instance, may oppose turnover
bias. Likewise, the evolutionary outcome depends on the strength of such
selection and population size, comparably to other biases acting on the
occurrence of mutations.

the special case that the free path distribution has at least first and second

  systems"	"  This paper studies the relations among system parameters, uniqueness, and
stability of equilibria, for kinetic systems given in the form of polynomial
ODEs. Such models are commonly used to describe the dynamics of nonnegative
systems, with a wide range of application fields such as chemistry, systems
biology, process modeling or even transportation systems. Using a flux-based
description of kinetic models, a canonical representation of the set of all
possible feasible equilibria is developed. The characterization is made in
terms of strictly stable compartmental matrices to define the so-called family
of solutions. Feasibility is imposed by a set of constraints, which are linear
on a log-transformed space of complexes, and relate to the kernel of a matrix,
the columns of which span the stoichiometric subspace. One particularly
interesting representation of these constraints can be expressed in terms of a
class of monotonous decreasing functions. This allows connections to be
established with classical results in CRNT that relate to the existence and
uniqueness of equilibria along positive stoichiometric compatibility classes.
In particular, monotonicity can be employed to identify regions in the set of
possible reaction rate coefficients leading to complex balancing, and to
conclude uniqueness of equilibria for a class of positive deficiency networks.
The latter result might support constructing an alternative proof of the
well-known deficiency one theorem. The developed notions and results are
illustrated through examples.

phenomena. Nerves, however, are thermodynamic systems, and changes in
temperature and in the dimensions of the nerve can also be observed during the
action potential. Measurements of heat changes during the action potential
suggest that the nerve pulse shares many characteristics with an adiabatic
pulse. First experiments in the 1980s suggested small changes in nerve
thickness and length during the action potential. Such findings have led to the
suggestion that the action potential may be related to electromechanical
solitons traveling without dissipation. However, they have been no modern
attempts to study mechanical phenomena in nerves. Here, we present
ultrasensitive AFM recordings of mechanical changes on the order of 2 - 12
{\AA} in the giant axons of the lobster. We show that the nerve thickness
changes in phase with voltage change. When stimulated at opposite ends of the
same axon, colliding action potentials pass through one another and do not
annihilate. These observations are consistent with a mechanical interpretation
of the nervous impulse.

the 'grand canonical ensemble' and formalisms from statistical mechanics and
thermodynamics to enumerate all possible viruses and to derive thermodynamic
variables for the system. We model the infection process as a series of energy
barriers determined by the genetic states of the virus and host as a function
of immune response and system temperature. We find a phase transition between a
positive temperature regime of normal replication and a negative temperature
'disordered' phase of the virus. These phases define different regimes in which
different genetic strategies are favored. Perhaps most importantly, it
demonstrates that the system has a real thermodynamic temperature. For normal
replication, this temperature is linearly related to effective temperature. The
strength of immune response rescales temperature but does not change the
observed linear relationship. For all temperatures and immunities studied, we
find a universal curve relating the order parameter to viral evolvability. Real
viruses have finite length RNA segments that encode for proteins which
determine their fitness; hence the methods put forth here could be refined to
apply to real biological systems, perhaps providing insight into immune escape,
the emergence of novel pathogens and other results of viral evolution.

of modern conservation biology. In the context of fisheries management and
marine ecosystem conservation, marine reserves often play a significant role to
achieve sustainable fisheries management. Consequently, a substantial number of
studies have been conducted to establish broad rules for the creation of MPAs,
or to test the effects of MPAs in specific regions. However, there still exist
many challenges for implementing MPAs that are effective at meeting their
goals. Deducing theoretical conditions guaranteeing that the introduction of
marine reserves will increase fisheries yields in age-structured population
dynamics is one such challenge. To derive such conditions, a simple
mathematical model is developed that follows an age-structured metapopulation
dynamics of a sedentary species. The obtained results suggest that a
sufficiently high fishing mortality rate and moderate recruitment success of an
individual's eggs is a necessary for marine reserves to increase fisheries
yields. The numerical calculations were conducted with the parameters of red
abalone (Haliotis rufescens) to visualize and to check validity of the
analytical results. They show good agreement with the analytical results, as
well as the results obtained in the previous works.

compartment surrounding the veins of their leaves to improve the efficiency of
carbon dioxide assimilation. Nonlinear relationships between carbon dioxide and
oxygen levels and reaction rates are key to their physiology but cannot be
handled with standard techniques of constraint-based metabolic modeling. We
demonstrate that incorporating these relationships as constraints on reaction
rates and solving the resulting nonlinear optimization problem yields realistic
predictions of the response of C4 systems to environmental and biochemical
perturbations. Using a new genome-scale reconstruction of maize metabolism, we
build an 18000-reaction, nonlinearly constrained model describing mesophyll and
bundle sheath cells in 15 segments of the developing maize leaf, interacting
via metabolite exchange, and use RNA-seq and enzyme activity measurements to
predict spatial variation in metabolic state by a novel method that optimizes
correlation between fluxes and expression data. Though such correlations are
known to be weak in general, here the predicted fluxes achieve high correlation
with the data, successfully capture the experimentally observed base-to-tip
transition between carbon-importing tissue and carbon-exporting tissue, and
include a nonzero growth rate, in contrast to prior results from similar
methods in other systems. We suggest that developmental gradients may be
particularly suited to the inference of metabolic fluxes from expression data.

prion diseases, which are invariably fatal and highly infectious
neurodegenerative diseases that affect a wide variety of species. In molecular
structures, TSE neurodegenerative diseases are caused by the conversion from a
soluble normal cellular prion protein, predominantly with alpha-helices, into
insoluble abnormally folded infectious prions, rich in beta-sheets. This paper
studies the molecular structure and structural dynamics of buffalo prion
protein, in order to reveal the reason why buffalo are resistant to prion
diseases. We first did molecular modeling of a homology structure constructed
by one mutation at residue 143 from the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance structure of
bovine and cattle PrP(124-227); immediately we found for buffalo PrPC(124-227)
there are 5 hydrogen bonds at Asn143, but at this position bovine/cattle do not
have such hydrogen bonds. Same as that of rabbits, dogs or horses, our
molecular dynamics studies also confirmed there is a strong salt bridge
ASP178-ARG164 (O-N) keeping the beta2-alpha2 loop linked in buffalo. We also
found there is a very strong hydrogen bond SER170-TYR218 linking this loop with
the C-terminal end of alpha-helix H3. Other information such as (i) there is a
very strong salt bridge HIS187-ARG156 (N-O) linking alpha-helices H2 and H1 (if
mutation H187R is made at position 187 then the hydrophobic core of PrPC will
be exposed), (ii) at D178, there is a hydrogen bond Y169-D178 and a polar
contact R164-D178 for BufPrPC instead of a polar contact Q168-D178 for bovine
PrPC, (iii) BufPrPC owns 3-10 helices at 125-127, 152-156 and in the
beta2-alpha2 loop respectively, and (iv) in beta2-alpha2 loop there are strong
pi-contacts, etc, has been discovered.

population at low immigration pressure. We assume a sufficiently strong Allee
effect that introduces, in deterministic theory, a large critical population
size for colonization. At low immigration rates, the average pre-colonization
population size is small thus invalidating the WKB approximation to the master
equation. We circumvent this difficulty by deriving an exact zero-flux solution
of the master equation and matching it with an approximate non-zero-flux
solution of the pertinent Fokker-Planck equation in a small region around the
critical population size. This procedure provides an accurate evaluation of the
quasi-stationary probability distribution of population sizes in the
pre-colonization state, and of the mean time to colonization, for a wide range
of immigration rates. At sufficiently high immigration rates our results agree
with WKB results obtained previously. At low immigration rates the results can
be very different.

resources within their environment. In effect this means that a growth of one
population, needs to be balanced by comparable reduction in populations of
others. In neutral models of biodiversity all populations are assumed to change
incrementally due to stochastic births and deaths of individuals. Here we
propose and model another redistribution mechanism driven by abrupt and severe
collapses of the entire population of a single species freeing up resources for
the remaining ones. This mechanism may be relevant e.g. for communities of
bacteria, with strain-specific collapses caused e.g. by invading
bacteriophages, or for other ecosystems where infectious diseases play an
important role.
  The emergent dynamics of our system is cyclic ""diversity waves"" triggered by
collapses of globally dominating populations. The population diversity peaks at
the beginning of each wave and exponentially decreases afterwards. Species
abundances are characterized by a bimodal time-aggregated distribution with the
lower peak formed by populations of recently collapsed or newly introduced
species, while the upper peak - species that has not yet collapsed in the
current wave. In most waves both upper and lower peaks are composed of several
smaller peaks. This self-organized hierarchical peak structure has a long-term
memory transmitted across several waves. It gives rise to a scale-free tail of
the time-aggregated population distribution with a universal exponent of 1.7.
We show that diversity wave dynamics is robust with respect to variations in
the rules of our model such as diffusion between multiple environments,
species-specific growth and extinction rates, and bet-hedging strategies.

particular, recently there has been growing interest in analyzing the joint SFS
data from multiple populations to infer parameters of complex demographic

underlying conformational switching and allostery within the coat protein of
the bacteriophage MS2. Assembly of most icosahedral virus capsids requires that
the capsid protein adopt different conformations at precise locations within
the capsid. It has been shown that a 19 nucleotide stem loop (TR) from the MS2
genome acts as an allosteric effector, guiding conformational switching of the
coat protein during capsid assembly. Since the principal conformational changes
occur far from the TR binding site, it is important to understand the molecular
mechanism underlying this allosteric communication. To this end, we use
all-atom simulations with explicit water combined with a path sampling
technique to sample the MS2 coat protein conformational transition, in the
presence and absence of TR-binding. The calculations find that TR binding
strongly alters the transition free energy profile, leading to a switch in the
favored conformation. We discuss changes in molecular interactions responsible
for this shift. We then identify networks of amino acids with correlated
motions to reveal the mechanism by which effects of TR binding span the
protein. The analysis predicts amino acids whose substitution by mutagenesis
could alter populations of the conformational substates or their transition
rates.

investigate the site-specific evolution of bone volume fraction across the
midshaft of a femur. The model includes hormonal regulation and biochemical
coupling of bone cell populations, the influence of the microstructure on bone
turnover rate, and mechanical adaptation of the tissue. Both microscopic and
tissue-scale stress/strain states of the tissue are calculated from macroscopic
loads by a combination of beam theory and micromechanical homogenisation.
  This model is applied to simulate the spatio-temporal evolution of a human
midshaft femur scan subjected to two deregulating circumstances: (i)
osteoporosis and (ii) mechanical disuse. Both simulated deregulations led to
endocortical bone loss, cortical wall thinning and expansion of the medullary
cavity, in accordance with experimental findings. Our model suggests that these
observations are attributable to a large extent to the influence of the
microstructure on bone turnover rate. Mechanical adaptation is found to help
preserve intracortical bone matrix near the periosteum. Moreover, it leads to
non-uniform cortical wall thickness due to the asymmetry of macroscopic loads
introduced by the bending moment. The effect of mechanical adaptation near the
endosteum can be greatly affected by whether the mechanical stimulus includes
stress concentration effects or not.

that LSTM networks predict the subcellular location of proteins given only the

  beneficial fitness effects"	"  Adaptation of asexual populations is driven by beneficial mutations and
therefore the dynamics of this process, besides other factors, depend on the
distribution of beneficial fitness effects. It is known that on uncorrelated
fitness landscapes, this distribution can only be of three types: truncated,
exponential and power law. We performed extensive stochastic simulations to
study the adaptation dynamics on rugged fitness landscapes, and identified two
quantities that can be used to distinguish the underlying distribution of
beneficial fitness effects. The first quantity studied here is the fitness
difference between successive mutations that spread in the population, which is
found to decrease in the case of truncated distributions, remain nearly a
constant for exponentially decaying distributions and increase when the fitness
distribution decays as a power law. The second quantity of interest, namely,
the rate of change of fitness with time also shows quantitatively different
behaviour for different beneficial fitness distributions. The patterns
displayed by the two aforementioned quantities are found to hold for both low

determine the distribution of beneficial fitness effects in microbial

system converges to a community process in which the prey dynamics is averaged
on the predator equilibria. This averaged process admits an invariant
probability measure which can be computed explicitly. We use numerical
simulations to study the convergence of the invariant probability measures of
the rescaled processes.

1503.02904	q-bio	q-bio.QM physics.bio-ph physics.flu-dyn	Energy cost and optimisation in breath-hold diving	"  We present a new model for calculating locomotion costs in breath-hold
divers. Starting from basic mechanics principles, we calculate the work that
the diver must provide through propulsion to counterbalance the action of drag,
the buoyant force and weight during immersion. Compared to those in previous
studies, the model presented here accurately analyses breath-hold divers which
alternate active swimming with prolonged glides during the dive (as is the case
in mammals). The energy cost of the dive is strongly dependent on these
prolonged gliding phases. Here we investigate the length and impacts on energy
cost of these glides with respect to the diver characteristics, and compare
them with those observed in different breath-hold diving species. Taking into
account the basal metabolic rate and chemical energy to propulsion
transformation efficiency, we calculate optimal swim velocity and the
corresponding total energy cost (including metabolic rate) and compare them
with observations. Energy cost is minimised when the diver passes through
neutral buoyancy conditions during the dive. This generally implies the
presence of prolonged gliding phases in both ascent and descent, where the
buoyancy (varying with depth) is best used against the drag, reducing energy
cost. This is in agreement with past results (Miller et al., 2012; Sato et al.,
2013) where, when the buoyant force is considered constant during the dive, the
energy cost was minimised for neutral buoyancy. In particular, our model
confirms the good physical adaption of dolphins for diving, compared to other
breath-hold diving species which are mostly positively buoyant (penguins for
example). The presence of prolonged glides implies a non-trivial dependency of
optimal speed on maximal depth of the dive. This extends previous findings
(Sato et al., 2010; Watanabe et al., 2011) which found no dependency of optimal
speed on dive depth for particular conditions. The energy cost of the dive can
be further diminished by reducing the volume of gas-filled body parts in divers
close to neutral buoyancy. This provides a possible additional explanation for
the observed exhalation of air before diving in phocid seals to minimise dive
energy cost. Until now the only explanation for this phenomenon has been a
reduction in the risk of decompression sickness.

1503.02929	q-bio	physics.bio-ph cond-mat.soft q-bio.SC	Motor-free actin bundle contractility driven by molecular crowding	"  Modeling approaches of suspended, rod-like particles and recent experimental
data have shown that depletion forces display different signatures depending on
the orientation of these particles. It has been shown that axial attraction of
two rods yields contractile forces of 0.1pN that are independent of the
relative axial shift of the two rods. Here, we measured depletion-caused
interactions of actin bundles extending the phase space of single pairs of rods
to a multi-particle system. In contrast to a filament pair, we found forces up
to 3pN . Upon bundle relaxation forces decayed exponentially with a mean decay
time of 3.4s . These different dynamics are explained within the frame of a
mathematical model by taking pairwise interactions to a multi-filament scale.
The macromolecular content employed for our experiments is well below the
crowding of cells. Thus, we propose that arising forces can contribute to
biological force generation without the need to convert chemical energy into
mechanical work.

emerging dynamical features of brain activity with the underlying modular
structure of neural connections, hierarchically organized throughout several
scales. The spontaneous emergence of coherence and synchronization across such
scales is crucial to neural function, while its anomalies often relate to
pathological conditions. Here we provide a numerical study of synchronization
dynamics in the human connectome network. Our purpose is to provide a detailed
characterization of the recently uncovered broad dynamic regime, interposed
between order and disorder, which stems from the hierarchical modular
organization of the human connectome. In this regime -similar in essence to a
Griffiths phase- synchronization dynamics are trapped within metastable
attractors of local coherence. Here we explore the role of noise, as an
effective description of external perturbations, and discuss how its presence
accounts for the ability of the system to escape intermittently from such
attractors and explore complex dynamic repertoires of locally coherent states,
in analogy with experimentally recorded patterns of cerebral activity.

1503.03343	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"On Eigen's quasispecies model, two-valued fitness landscapes, and
  isometry groups acting on finite metric spaces"	"  A two-valued fitness landscape is introduced for the classical Eigen's
quasispecies model. This fitness landscape can be considered as a direct
generalization of the so-called single or sharply peaked landscape. A general,
non permutation invariant quasispecies model is studied, therefore the
dimension of the problem is $2^N\times 2^N$, where $N$ is the sequence length.
It is shown that if the fitness function is equal to $w+s$ on a $G$-orbit $A$
and is equal to $w$ elsewhere, then the mean population fitness can be found as
the largest root of an algebraic equation of degree at most $N+1$. Here $G$ is
an arbitrary isometry group acting on the metric space of sequences of zeroes
and ones of the length $N$ with the Hamming distance. An explicit form of this
exact algebraic equation is given in terms of the spherical growth function of
the $G$-orbit $A$. Sufficient conditions for the so-called error threshold for
sequences of orbits are given. Motivated by the analysis of the two-valued
fitness landscapes an abstract generalization of Eigen's model is introduced
such that the sequences are identified with the points of a finite metric space
$X$ together with a group of isometries acting transitively on $X$. In
particular, a simplicial analogue of the original quasispecies model is
discussed, which can be considered as a mathematical model of the switching of
the antigenic variants for some bacteria.

  Selection"	"  Evolution in its course found a variety of solutions to the same optimisation
problem. The advent of high-throughput genomic sequencing has made available
extensive data from which, in principle, one can infer the underlying structure
on which biological functions rely. In this paper, we present a new method
aimed at extracting sites encoding structural and func- tional properties from
a set of protein primary sequences, namely a Multiple Sequence Alignment. The
method, called Critical Variable Selection, is based on the idea that subsets
of relevant sites cor- respond to subsequences that occur with a particularly
broad frequency distribution in the dataset. By applying this algorithm to in
silico sequences, to the Response Regulator Receiver and to the Voltage Sensor
Domain of Ion Channels, we show that this procedure recovers not only
information encoded in single site statistics and pairwise correlations but it
also captures dependencies going beyond pairwise correlations. The method
proposed here is complementary to Statistical Coupling Analysis, in that the
most relevant sites predicted by the two methods markedly differ. We find
robust and consistent results for datasets as small as few hundred sequences,
that reveal a hidden hierarchy of sites that is consistent with present
knowledge on biologically relevant sites and evo- lutionary dynamics. This
suggests that Critical Variable Selection is able to identify in a Multiple
Sequence Alignment a core of sites encoding functional and structural
information.

1503.03928	q-bio	q-bio.SC	Spatial organization of bacterial transcription and translation	"  In bacteria such as $\textit{Escherichia coli}$, DNA is compacted into a
nucleoid near the cell center, while ribosomes$-$molecular complexes that
translate messenger RNAs (mRNAs) into proteins$-$are mainly localized at the
poles. We study the impact of this spatial organization using a minimal
reaction-diffusion model for the cellular transcriptional-translational
machinery. Our model predicts that $\sim 90\%$ of mRNAs are segregated to the
poles and reveals a ""circulation"" of ribosomes driven by the flux of mRNAs,
from synthesis in the nucleoid to degradation at the poles. To address the
existence of non-specific, transient interactions between ribosomes and mRNAs,
we developed a novel method to efficiently incorporate such transient
interactions into reaction-diffusion equations, which allowed us to quantify
the biological implications of such non-specific interactions, e.g. for
ribosome efficiency.

algorithm that is constrained to generate partitions of the input space into
high and low values. The motivation of splitting input variables into high and
low values is to favour the semantic interpretation of the final clustering.
The Expectation-Maximization binary Clustering is specially useful when a
bimodal conditional distribution of the variables is expected or at least when
a binary discretization of the input space is deemed meaningful. Furthermore,
the algorithm deals with the reliability of the input data such that the larger
their uncertainty the less their role in the final clustering. We show here its
suitability for behavioural annotation of movement trajectories. However, it
can be considered as a general purpose algorithm for the clustering or
segmentation of multivariate data or temporal series.

1503.04224	q-bio	q-bio.PE q-bio.GN	"Consistency of VDJ rearrangement and substitution parameters enables
  accurate B cell receptor sequence annotation"	"  VDJ rearrangement and somatic hypermutation work together to produce
antibody-coding B cell receptor (BCR) sequences for a remarkable diversity of
antigens. It is now possible to sequence these BCRs in high throughput;
analysis of these sequences is bringing new insight into how antibodies
develop, in particular for broadly-neutralizing antibodies against HIV and
influenza. A fundamental step in such sequence analysis is to annotate each
base as coming from a specific one of the V, D, or J genes, or from an
N-addition (a.k.a. non-templated insertion). Previous work has used simple
parametric distributions to model transitions from state to state in a hidden
Markov model (HMM) of VDJ recombination, and assumed that mutations occur via
the same process across sites. However, codon frame and other effects have been
observed to violate these parametric assumptions for such coding sequences,
suggesting that a non-parametric approach to modeling the recombination process
could be useful. In our paper, we find that indeed large modern data sets
suggest a model using parameter-rich per-allele categorical distributions for
HMM transition probabilities and per-allele-per-position mutation
probabilities, and that using such a model for inference leads to significantly
improved results. We present an accurate and efficient BCR sequence annotation
software package using a novel HMM ""factorization"" strategy. This package,
called partis (https://github.com/psathyrella/partis/), is built on a new
general-purpose HMM compiler that can perform efficient inference given a
simple text description of an HMM.

  selectivity in a neural system"	"  Orientation selectivity is a remarkable feature of the neurons located in the
primary visual cortex. Provided that the visual neurons acquire orientation
selectivity through activity-dependent Hebbian learning, the development
process could be understood as a kind of symmetry breaking phenomenon in the
view of physics. The key mechanisms of the development process are examined
here in a neural system. Found is that there are at least two different
mechanisms which lead to the development of orientation selectivity through
breaking the radial symmetry in receptive fields. The first, a simultaneous
symmetry breaking mechanism, bases on the competition between neighboring
neurons, and the second, a spontaneous one, bases on the nonlinearity in
interactions. It turns out that only the second mechanism leads to the
formation of a columnar pattern which characteristics accord with those
observed in an animal experiment.

1503.05074	q-bio	q-bio.GN q-bio.PE	Analysis of whole mitogenomes from ancient samples	"  Ancient mitochondrial DNA has been used in a wide variety of palaeontological
and archaeological studies, ranging from population dynamics of extinct species
to patterns of domestication. Most of these studies have traditionally been
based on the analysis of short fragments from the mitochondrial control region,
analysed using PCR coupled with Sanger sequencing. With the introduction of
high-throughput sequencing, as well as new enrichment technologies, the
recovery of full mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from ancient specimens has
become significantly less complicated. Here we present a protocol to build
ancient extracts into Illumina high-throughput sequencing libraries, and
subsequent Agilent array-based capture to enrich for the desired mitogenome.
Both are based on previously published protocols, with the introduction of
several improvements aimed to increase the recovery of short DNA fragments,
while keeping the cost and effort requirements low. This protocol was designed
for enrichment of mitochondrial DNA in ancient or degraded samples. However,
the protocols can be easily adapted for using for building libraries for
shotgun-sequencing of whole genomes, or enrichment of other genomic regions.

1503.05140	q-bio	q-bio.QM cs.AI cs.LG q-bio.GN	ProtVec: A Continuous Distributed Representation of Biological Sequences	"  We introduce a new representation and feature extraction method for
biological sequences. Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological
sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid
sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation
can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics.
In the present paper, we focus on protein-vectors that can be utilized in a
wide array of bioinformatics investigations such as family classification,
protein visualization, structure prediction, disordered protein identification,
and protein-protein interaction prediction. In this method, we adopt artificial
neural network approaches and represent a protein sequence with a single dense
n-dimensional vector. To evaluate this method, we apply it in classification of
324,018 protein sequences obtained from Swiss-Prot belonging to 7,027 protein
families, where an average family classification accuracy of 93%+-0.06% is
obtained, outperforming existing family classification methods. In addition, we
use ProtVec representation to predict disordered proteins from structured
proteins. Two databases of disordered sequences are used: the DisProt database
as well as a database featuring the disordered regions of nucleoporins rich
with phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG-Nups). Using support vector machine
classifiers, FG-Nup sequences are distinguished from structured protein
sequences found in Protein Data Bank (PDB) with a 99.8% accuracy, and
unstructured DisProt sequences are differentiated from structured DisProt
sequences with 100.0% accuracy. These results indicate that by only providing
sequence data for various proteins into this model, accurate information about
protein structure can be determined.

  Curvilinear effect"	"  In a world in which many pressing global issues require large scale
cooperation, understanding the group size effect on cooperative behavior is a
topic of central importance. Yet, the nature of this effect remains largely
unknown, with lab experiments insisting that it is either positive or negative
or null, and field experiments suggesting that it is instead curvilinear. Here
we shed light on this apparent contradiction by considering a novel class of
public goods games inspired to the realistic scenario in which the natural
output limits of the public good imply that the benefit of cooperation
increases fast for early contributions and then decelerates. We report on a
large lab experiment providing evidence that, in this case, group size has a
curvilinear effect on cooperation, according to which intermediate-size groups
cooperate more than smaller groups and more than larger groups. In doing so,
our findings help fill the gap between lab experiments and field experiments
and suggest concrete ways to promote large scale cooperation among people.

phase resetting curve, isochronous synchrony is an unstable attractor and
arbitrarily weak noise can destroy entrainment and generate intermittent phase
slips. Small inhomogeneity (mismatch in the intrinsic firing rate of the
neurons) can stabilize the phase locking and lead to more precise relative
spike timing of the two neurons. The results can explain how for a class of
neuronal models, including leaky integrate-fire model, inhomogeneity can
increase correlation of spike trains when the neurons are synaptically
connected.

  intra-tumor heterogeneity"	"  Most cancers in humans are large, measuring centimeters in diameter, composed
of many billions of cells. An equivalent mass of normal cells would be highly
heterogeneous as a result of the mutations that occur during each cell
division. What is remarkable about cancers is their homogeneity - virtually
every neoplastic cell within a large cancer contains the same core set of
genetic alterations, with heterogeneity confined to mutations that have emerged
after the last clonal expansions. How such clones expand within the
spatially-constrained three dimensional architecture of a tumor, and come to
dominate a large, pre-existing lesion, has never been explained. We here
describe a model for tumor evolution that shows how short-range migration and
cell turnover can account for rapid cell mixing inside the tumor. With it, we
show that even a small selective advantage of a single cell within a large
tumor allows the descendants of that cell to replace the precursor mass in a
clinically relevant time frame. We also demonstrate that the same mechanisms
can be responsible for the rapid onset of resistance to chemotherapy. Our model
not only provides novel insights into spatial and temporal aspects of tumor
growth but also suggests that targeting short range cellular migratory activity
could have dramatic effects on tumor growth rates.

1503.08324	q-bio	q-bio.QM	"Outcome prediction in mathematical models of immune response to
  infection"	"  Clinicians need to predict patient outcomes with high accuracy as early as
possible after disease inception. In this manuscript, we show that
patient-to-patient variability sets a fundamental limit on outcome prediction
accuracy for a general class of mathematical models for the immune response to
infection. However, accuracy can be increased at the expense of delayed
prognosis. We investigate several systems of ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) that model the host immune response to a pathogen load. Advantages of
systems of ODEs for investigating the immune response to infection include the
ability to collect data on large numbers of `virtual patients', each with a
given set of model parameters, and obtain many time points during the course of
the infection. We implement patient-to-patient variability $v$ in the ODE
models by randomly selecting the model parameters from Gaussian distributions
with variance $v$ that are centered on physiological values. We use logistic
regression with one-versus-all classification to predict the discrete
steady-state outcomes of the system. We find that the prediction algorithm
achieves near $100\%$ accuracy for $v=0$, and the accuracy decreases with
increasing $v$ for all ODE models studied. The fact that multiple steady-state
outcomes can be obtained for a given initial condition, i.e. the basins of
attraction overlap in the space of initial conditions, limits the prediction
accuracy for $v>0$. Increasing the elapsed time of the variables used to train
and test the classifier, increases the prediction accuracy, while adding
explicit external noise to the ODE models decreases the prediction accuracy.
Our results quantify the competition between early prognosis and high
prediction accuracy that is frequently encountered by clinicians.

challenge for methods like X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy has
evolved as an alternative technique to study structure and dynamics of membrane
proteins. The present study demonstrates the feasibility of membrane protein
topology determination using limited EPR distance and accessibility
measurements. The BCL::MP-Fold (BioChemical Library membrane protein fold)
algorithm assembles secondary structure elements (SSEs) in the membrane using a
Monte Carlo Metropolis (MCM) approach. Sampled models are evaluated using
knowledge-based potential functions and agreement with the EPR data and a
knowledge-based energy function. Twenty-nine membrane proteins of up to 696
residues are used to test the algorithm. The RMSD100 value of the most accurate
model is better than 8 {\AA} for twenty-seven, better than 6 {\AA} for
twenty-two and better than 4 {\AA} for fifteen out of twenty-nine proteins,
demonstrating the algorithms ability to sample the native topology. The average
enrichment could be improved from 1.3 to 2.5, showing the improved
discrimination power by using EPR data.

from the endoplasmic reticulum via inositol-4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP$_3$R)
channels (among other possibilities such as RyR and L-type calcium channels).
The resulting dynamics are highly diverse, lead to local calcium ""puffs"" as
well as global waves propagating through cells, as observed in {\it Xenopus}
oocytes, neurons, and other cell types. Local fluctuations in the number of
calcium ions play a crucial role in the onset of these features. Previous
modeling studies of calcium puff dynamics stemming from IP$_3$R channels have
predominantly focused on stochastic channel models coupled to deterministic
diffusion of ions, thereby neglecting local fluctuations of the ion number.
Tracking of individual ions is computationally difficult due to the scale
separation in the Ca$^{2+}$ concentration when channels are in the open or
closed states. In this paper, a spatial multiscale model for investigating of
the dynamics of puffs is presented. It couples Brownian motion (diffusion) of
ions with a stochastic channel gating model. The model is used to analyze
calcium puff statistics. Concentration time traces as well as channel state
information are studied. We identify the regime in which puffs can be found and
develop a mean-field theory to extract the boundary of this regime. Puffs are
only possible when the time scale of channel inhibition is sufficiently large.
Implications for the understanding of puff generation and termination are
discussed.

bioinformatics pipelines. As a consequence, the sensitivity and precision of
the mapping tool, applied with certain parameters to certain data, can
critically affect the accuracy of produced results (e.g., in variant calling
applications). Therefore, there has been an increasing demand of methods for
comparing mappers and for measuring effects of their parameters.
  Read simulators combined with alignment evaluation tools provide the most
straightforward way to evaluate and compare mappers. Simulation of reads is
accompanied by information about their positions in the source genome. This
information is then used to evaluate alignments produced by the mapper.
Finally, reports containing statistics of successful read alignments are
created.
  In default of standards for encoding read origins, every evaluation tool has
to be made explicitly compatible with the simulator used to generate reads. In
order to solve this obstacle, we have created a generic format RNF (Read Naming
Format) for assigning read names with encoded information about original
positions.
  Futhermore, we have developed an associated software package RNF containing
two principal components. MIShmash applies one of popular read simulating tools
(among DwgSim, Art, Mason, CuReSim etc.) and transforms the generated reads
into RNF format. LAVEnder evaluates then a given read mapper using simulated
reads in RNF format. A special attention is payed to mapping qualities that
serve for parametrization of ROC curves, and to evaluation of the effect of
read sample contamination.

functions. Many complex periodic elements in genomes are difficult to be
detected by commonly used digital signal processing (DSP). We present a novel
method to compute the periodic power spectrum of a DNA sequence based on the
nucleotide distributions on periodic positions of the sequence. The method
directly calculates full periodic spectrum of a DNA sequence rather than
frequency spectrum by Fourier transform. The magnitude of the periodic power
spectrum reflects the strength of the periodicity signals, thus, the algorithm
can capture all the latent periodicities in DNA sequences. We apply this method
on detection of latent periodicities in different genome elements, including
exons and microsatellite DNA sequences. The results show that the method
minimizes the impact of spectral leakage, captures a much broader latent
periodicities in genomes, and outperforms the conventional Fourier transform.

spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on a combination of Gaussian receptive
fields over the spatial domain and first-order integrators or equivalently
truncated exponential filters coupled in cascade over the temporal domain.
  Compared to previous spatio-temporal scale-space formulations in terms of
non-enhancement of local extrema or scale invariance, these receptive fields
are based on different scale-space axiomatics over time by ensuring
non-creation of new local extrema or zero-crossings with increasing temporal
scale. Specifically, extensions are presented about (i) parameterizing the
intermediate temporal scale levels, (ii) analysing the resulting temporal
dynamics, (iii) transferring the theory to a discrete implementation, (iv)
computing scale-normalized spatio-temporal derivative expressions for
spatio-temporal feature detection and (v) computational modelling of receptive
fields in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the primary visual cortex
(V1) in biological vision.
  We show that by distributing the intermediate temporal scale levels according
to a logarithmic distribution, we obtain much faster temporal response
properties (shorter temporal delays) compared to a uniform distribution.
Specifically, these kernels converge very rapidly to a limit kernel possessing
true self-similar scale-invariant properties over temporal scales, thereby
allowing for true scale invariance over variations in the temporal scale,
although the underlying temporal scale-space representation is based on a
discretized temporal scale parameter.
  We show how scale-normalized temporal derivatives can be defined for these
time-causal scale-space kernels and how the composed theory can be used for
computing basic types of scale-normalized spatio-temporal derivative
expressions in a computationally efficient manner.

$L_p$ varies from 30~nm to 55~nm, and is compared to previous experimental
results. For the Na$^+$ only case, $L_p$ is an increasing concave function of
$I^{-1}$, well fitted by Manning's electrostatic stretching approach, but not
by classical Odjik-Skolnick-Fixman theories with or without counter-ion
condensation. With added Mg$^{2+}$ ions, $L_p$ shows a marked decrease at low

$I^{-1}$, fitted by a proposed variational approach.

1504.02751	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Has wild poliovirus been eliminated from Nigeria?	"  Wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) has not been seen anywhere since the last case
of WPV3-associated paralysis in Nigeria in November 2012. At the time of
writing, the most recent case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Nigeria
occurred in July 2014, and WPV1 has not been seen in Africa since a case in
Somalia in August 2014. No cases associated with circulating vaccine-derived
type 2 poliovirus (cVDPV2) have been detected in Nigeria since November 2014.
Has WPV1 been eliminated from Africa? Has WPV3 been eradicated globally? Has
Nigeria interrupted cVDPV2 transmission? These questions are difficult because
polio surveillance is based on paralysis and paralysis only occurs in a small
fraction of infections.
  This report provides estimates for the probabilities of poliovirus
elimination in Nigeria given available data as of March 31, 2015. It is based
on a model of disease transmission that is built from historical polio
incidence rates and is designed to represent the uncertainties in transmission
dynamics and poliovirus detection that are fundamental to interpreting long
time periods without cases.
  The model estimates that, as of March 31, 2015, the probability of WPV1
elimination in Nigeria is 84%, and that if WPV1 has not been eliminated, a new

of WPV3 elimination (and thus global eradication) is >99%. However, it is
unlikely that the ongoing transmission of cVDPV2 has been interrupted; the
probability of cVDPV2 elimination rises to 83% if no new cases are detected by
April 2016.
  Added July 10, 2015: On June 26, a cVDPV2 case was confirmed by the Global
Polio Laboratory Network. The date of paralysis was May 16. The case provides
new information about cVDPV2 prevalence that is useful for assessing the
accuracy of previous predictions and informing an updated forecast for the time
to cVDPV2 elimination.

1504.03202	q-bio	q-bio.PE	On the roles of hunting and habitat size on the extinction of megafauna	"  We study a mechanistic mathematical model of extinction and coexistence in a
generic hunter-prey ecosystem. The model represents typical scenarios of human
invasion and environmental change, characteristic of the late Pleistocene,
concomitant with the extinction of fauna in many regions of the world. As a
first approach we focus on a small trophic web of three species, including two
herbivores in asymmetric competition, in order to characterize the generic
behaviors. Specifically, we use a stochastic dynamical system, allowing the
study of the role of fluctuations and spatial correlations. We show that the
presence of hunters drives the superior herbivore to extinction even in
habitats that would allow coexistence, and even when the pressure of hunting is
lower than on the inferior one. The role of system size and fluctuating
populations is addressed, showing an ecological meltdown in small systems in
the presence of humans. The time to extinction as a function of the system
size, as calculated with the model, shows a good agreement with paleontological
data. Other findings show the intricate play of the anthropic and environmental
factors that may have caused the extinction of megafauna.

is a fundamental research problem in biology and medicine. Electron
Cryomicroscopy (Cryo-EM) is a promising vision-based technique for structure
estimation which attempts to reconstruct 3D structures from 2D images. This
paper addresses the challenging problem of 3D reconstruction from 2D Cryo-EM
images. A new framework for estimation is introduced which relies on modern
stochastic optimization techniques to scale to large datasets. We also
introduce a novel technique which reduces the cost of evaluating the objective
function during optimization by over five orders or magnitude. The net result
is an approach capable of estimating 3D molecular structure from large scale
datasets in about a day on a single workstation.

and certain other properties of tissues analyzed as systems consisting of
interacting cells. Tissues are considered as structures made of regular
healthy, senescent, dead (apoptotic) cells, and studied dynamically, with the
ongoing processes including regular cell division to fill vacant sites left by
dead cells, healthy cells becoming senescent or dying, and other processes.
Statistical-mechanics description can provide patterns of time dependence and
snapshots of morphological system properties. An illustrative application of
the developed theoretical modeling approach is reported, confirming recent
experimental findings that inhibition of senescence can lead to extended
lifespan.

1504.03584	q-bio	cs.IT math.IT physics.data-an q-bio.NC	"Synergetic and redundant information flow detected by unnormalized
  Granger causality: application to resting state fMRI"	"  Objectives: We develop a framework for the analysis of synergy and redundancy
in the pattern of information flow between subsystems of a complex network.
Methods: The presence of redundancy and/or synergy in multivariate time series
data renders difficult to estimate the neat flow of information from each
driver variable to a given target. We show that adopting an unnormalized
definition of Granger causality one may put in evidence redundant multiplets of
variables influencing the target by maximizing the total Granger causality to a
given target, over all the possible partitions of the set of driving variables.
Consequently we introduce a pairwise index of synergy which is zero when two
independent sources additively influence the future state of the system,
differently from previous definitions of synergy. Results: We report the
application of the proposed approach to resting state fMRI data from the Human
Connectome Project, showing that redundant pairs of regions arise mainly due to
space contiguity and interhemispheric symmetry, whilst synergy occurs mainly
between non-homologous pairs of regions in opposite hemispheres. Conclusions:
Redundancy and synergy, in healthy resting brains, display characteristic
patterns, revealed by the proposed approach. Significance: The pairwise synergy
index, here introduced, maps the informational character of the system at hand
into a weighted complex network: the same approach can be applied to other
complex systems whose normal state corresponds to a balance between redundant
and synergetic circuits.

  conformers of 20 proteinogenic amino acids"	"  We present a structural data set of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids and
their amino-methylated and acetylated (capped) dipeptides. Different
protonation states of the backbone (uncharged and zwitterionic) were considered
for the amino acids as well as varied side chain protonation states.
Furthermore, we studied amino acids and dipeptides in complex with divalent
cations (Ca2+, Ba2+, Sr2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, and Hg2+). The database covers the
conformational hierarchies of 280 systems in a wide relative energy range of up
to 4 eV (390 kJ/mol), summing up to an overall of 45,892 stationary points on
the respective potential-energy surfaces. All systems were calculated on equal
first-principles footing, applying density-functional theory in the generalized
gradient approximation corrected for long-range van der Waals interactions. We
show good agreement to available experimental data for gas-phase ion
affinities. Our curated data can be utilized, for example, for a wide
comparison across chemical space of the building blocks of life, for the
parametrization of protein force fields, and for the calculation of reference
spectra for biophysical applications.

1504.03832	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Most undirected random graphs are amplifiers of selection for
  Birth-death dynamics, but suppressors of selection for death-Birth dynamics"	"  We analyze evolutionary dynamics on graphs, where the nodes represent
individuals of a population. The links of a node describe which other
individuals can be displaced by the offspring of the individual on that node.
Amplifiers of selection are graphs for which the fixation probability is
increased for advantageous mutants and decreased for disadvantageous mutants. A
few examples of such amplifiers have been developed, but so far it is unclear
how many such structures exist and how to construct them. Here, we show that
almost any undirected random graph is an amplifier of selection for Birth-death
updating, where an individual is selected to reproduce with probability
proportional to its fitness and one of its neighbors is replaced by that
offspring at random. If we instead focus on death-Birth updating, in which a
random individual is removed and its neighbors compete for the empty spot, then
the same ensemble of graphs consists of almost only suppressors of selection
for which the fixation probability is decreased for advantageous mutants and
increased for disadvantageous mutants. Thus, the impact of population structure
on evolutionary dynamics is a subtle issue that will depend on seemingly minor
details of the underlying evolutionary process.

1504.03940	q-bio	q-bio.BM	Model of protein fragments and statistical potentials	"  We discuss a model of protein conformations where the conformations are
combinations of short fragments from some small set. For these fragments we
consider a distribution of frequencies of occurrence of pairs (sequence of
amino acids, conformation), averaged over some balls in the spaces of sequences
and conformations. These frequencies can be estimated due to smallness of
epsilon-entropy of the set of conformations of protein fragments.
  We consider statistical potentials for protein fragments which describe the
mentioned frequencies of occurrence and discuss model of free energy of a
protein where the free energy is equal to a sum of statistical potentials of
the fragments.
  We also consider contribution of contacts of fragments to the energy of
protein conformation, and contribution from statistical potentials of some
hierarchical set of larger protein fragments. This set of fragments is
constructed using the distribution of frequencies of occurrence of short
fragments.
  We discuss applications of this model to problem of prediction of the native
conformation of a protein from its primary structure and to description of
dynamics of a protein. Modification of structural alignment taking into account
statistical potentials for protein fragments is considered and application to
threading procedure for proteins is discussed.

1504.04430	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio.SC	Critical Waves and the Length Problem of Biology	"  It is pointed out that the mystery of how biological systems measure their
lengths vanishes away if one premises that they have discovered a way to
generate linear waves analogous to compressional sound. These can be used to
detect length at either large or small scales using echo timing and fringe
counting. It is shown that suitable linear chemical potential waves can, in
fact, be manufactured by tuning to criticality conventional reaction-diffusion
with a small number substances. Min oscillations in E. coli are cited as
precedent resonant length measurement using chemical potential waves analogous
to laser detection. Mitotic structures in eucaryotes are identified as
candidates for such an effect at higher frequency. The engineering principle is
shown to be very general and functionally the same as that used by hearing
organs.
  PNAS Significance Statement: This paper invokes physical principles to
address the question of how living things might use reaction-diffusion to
measure out and regulate the many thousands of lengths required to make their
body parts and internal organs. It argues that two ideas have been missing. One
is that oscillation is necessary to achieve the necessary design stability and
plasticity. The other is that the system must be tuned to criticality to
stabilize the propagation velocity, thus enabling clocks to function as meter
sticks. The broader significance is twofold: First, a fundamental piece of the
machinery of life is probably invisible to present-day biochemical methods
because they are too slow. Second, the simplicity of growth and form identified
a century ago by D'Arcy Thompson is probably a symptom of biological
engineering strategies, not primitive law.

biological feedback loop, that is, a type-dependent spin system, this class of
stochastic models was introduced by Fern\'andez et. al (2009), and are useful
since take account to inherent variability of gene expression. We analyze a
non-symmetric feedback module being an extension for the repressilator, the
first synthetic biological oscillator, invented by Elowitz and Leibler (2000).
We consider a mean-field dynamics for a type-dependent Ising model, and then
study the empirical-magnetization vector representing concentration of
molecules. We apply a convergence result from stochastic jump processes to
deterministic trajectories and present a bifurcation analysis for the
associated dynamical system. We show that non-symmetric module under study can
exhibit very rich behaviours, including the empirical oscillations described by
repressilator.

1504.05143	q-bio	cs.NE q-bio.NC	Network Plasticity as Bayesian Inference	"  General results from statistical learning theory suggest to understand not
only brain computations, but also brain plasticity as probabilistic inference.
But a model for that has been missing. We propose that inherently stochastic
features of synaptic plasticity and spine motility enable cortical networks of
neurons to carry out probabilistic inference by sampling from a posterior
distribution of network configurations. This model provides a viable
alternative to existing models that propose convergence of parameters to
maximum likelihood values. It explains how priors on weight distributions and
connection probabilities can be merged optimally with learned experience, how
cortical networks can generalize learned information so well to novel
experiences, and how they can compensate continuously for unforeseen
disturbances of the network. The resulting new theory of network plasticity
explains from a functional perspective a number of experimental data on
stochastic aspects of synaptic plasticity that previously appeared to be quite
puzzling.

1504.05462	q-bio	physics.bio-ph physics.data-an q-bio.QM	Optimizing experimental parameters for tracking of diffusing particles	"  We describe how a single-particle tracking experiment should be designed in
order for its recorded trajectories to contain the most information about a
tracked particle's diffusion coefficient. The precision of estimators for the
diffusion coefficient is affected by motion blur, limited photon statistics,
and the length of recorded time-series. We demonstrate for a particle
undergoing free diffusion that precision is negligibly affected by motion blur
in typical experiments, while optimizing photon counts and the number of
recorded frames is the key to precision. Building on these results, we describe
for a wide range of experimental scenarios how to choose experimental
parameters in order to optimize the precision. Generally, one should choose
quantity over quality: experiments should be designed to maximize the number of
frames recorded in a time-series, even if this means lower information content
in individual frames.

classified as pusher- and puller-type, which characterize hydrodynamic
interactions with other cells or boundaries. Using experimentally measured beat
patterns, we compute that flagellated alga and sperm oscillate between pusher
and puller. Beyond a typical distance of 100 um from the swimmer, inertia
attenuates oscillatory micro-flows. We show that hydrodynamic interactions
between swimmers oscillate in time and are of similar magnitude as stochastic
swimming fluctuations.

  heterogeneous metapopulations"	"  We investigate the role of migration patterns on the spread of epidemics in
complex networks. We enhance the SIS-diffusion model on metapopulations to a
nonlinear diffusion. Specifically, individuals move randomly over the network
but at a rate depending on the population of the departure patch. In the
absence of epidemics, the migration-driven equilibrium is described by
quantifying the total number of individuals living in heavily/lightly populated
areas. Our analytical approach reveals that strengthening the migration from
populous areas contains the infection at the early stage of the epidemic.
Moreover, depending on the exponent of the nonlinear diffusion rate, epidemic
outbreaks do not always occur in the most populated areas as one might expect.

1504.06091	q-bio	q-bio.CB physics.bio-ph q-bio.QM	"A Stochastic Multiscale Model that Explains the Segregation of Axonal
  Microtubules and Neurofilaments in Neurological Diseases"	"  The organization of the axonal cytoskeleton is a key determinant of the
normal function of an axon, which is a long thin projection away from a neuron.
Under normal conditions two axonal cytoskeletal polymers microtubules and
neurofilaments align longitudinally in axons and are interspersed in axonal
cross-sections. However, in many neurotoxic and neurodegenerative disorders,
microtubules and neurofilaments segregate apart from each other, with
microtubules and membranous organelles clustered centrally and neurofilaments
displaced to the periphery. This striking segregation precedes abnormal and
excessive neurofilament accumulation in these diseases, which in turn leads to
focal axonal swellings. While neurofilament accumulation suggests the
impairment of neurofilament transport along axons, the underlying mechanism of
their segregation from microtubules remains poorly understood for over 30
years. To address this question, we developed a stochastic multiscale model for
the cross-sectional distribution of microtubules and neurofilaments in axons.
The model describes microtubules, neurofilaments and organelles as interacting
particles in a 2D cross-section, and incorporates the stochastic interactions
these particles through molecular motors. Simulations of the model demonstrate
that organelles can pull nearby microtubules together, and in the absence of
neurofilament transport, this mechanism gradually segregates microtubules from
neurofilaments on a time scale of hours, similar to that observed in toxic
neuropathies. This suggests that the microtubule-neurofilament segregation is
simply a consequence of the selective impairment of neurofilament transport.
The model generates the experimentally testable prediction that the rate and
extent of segregation will be dependent on the sizes of the moving organelles
as well as the density of their traffic.

With this extension of the Immersed Bounadry Method (IBM), we use the

the biofilm as a viscoelastic fluid possessing variable rheological properties
anchored to a set of moving locations (i.e., the bacteria locations). We
validate our modeling approach from Part I by comparing dynamic moduli and
compliance moduli computed from our model to data from mechanical
characterization experiments on Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms. The
experimental setup is described in Pavlovsky et al. (2013) in which biofilms
are grown and tested in a parallel plate rheometer. Matlab code used to produce
results in this paper will be available at

1504.07422	q-bio	q-bio.NC math.PR quant-ph	Is there contextuality in behavioral and social systems?	"  Most behavioral and social experiments aimed at revealing contextuality are
confined to cyclic systems with binary outcomes. In quantum physics, this broad
class of systems includes as special cases
Klyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky-type, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bell-type, and
Suppes-Zanotti-Leggett-Garg-type systems. The theory of contextuality known as
Contextuality-by-Default allows one to define and measure contextuality in all
such system, even if there are context-dependent errors in measurements, or if
something in the contexts directly interacts with the measurements. This makes
the theory especially suitable for behavioral and social systems, where direct
interactions of ""everything with everything"" are ubiquitous. For cyclic systems
with binary outcomes the theory provides necessary and sufficient conditions
for noncontextuality, and these conditions are known to be breached in certain
quantum systems. We review several behavioral and social data sets (from polls
of public opinion to visual illusions to conjoint choices to word combinations
to psychophysical matching), and none of these data provides any evidence for
contextuality. Our working hypothesis is that this may be a broadly applicable
rule: behavioral and social systems are noncontextual, i.e., all ""contextual
effects"" in them result from the ubiquitous dependence of response
distributions on the elements of contexts other than the ones to which the
response is presumably or normatively directed.

thoroughly many biological processes because they involve a local bending of
the double helix axis, either intrinsic to the sequence or induced by the
binding of proteins. Developing a method to measure DNA bend angles that does
not perturb the conformation of the DNA itself or the DNA-protein complex is a
challenging task. Here, we propose a joint theory-experiment high throughput
approach to rigorously measure such bend angles using the Tethered Particle
Motion (TPM) technique. By carefully modeling the TPM geometry, we propose a
simple formula based on a kinked Worm-Like Chain model to extract the bend
angle from TPM measurements. Using constructs made of 575 base-pair DNAs with
in-phase assemblies of 1 to 7 6A-tracts, we find that the sequence CA6CGG
induces a bend angle of 19 [4] {\deg}. Our method is successfully compared to
more theoretically complex or experimentally invasive ones such as cyclization,
NMR, FRET or AFM. We further apply our procedure to TPM measurements from the
literature and demonstrate that the angles of bends induced by proteins, such
as Integration Host Factor (IHF) can be reliably evaluated as well.

our data mining algorithm and interestingness measures to datasets from the
Gene Expression Database at the Mouse Genome Informatics as a preliminary proof
of concept to mine relationships between developmental stages in the mouse
anatomy ontology and Gene Ontology concepts (biological process, molecular
function and cellular component). In addition, we present a comparison of our

datasets provide a valuable resource for discovery of relationships across
ontologies. The use of efficient data mining methods and appropriate

the membrane potentials of an infinite set of interacting neurons. We prove the
existence and uniqueness of the process, using a perfect simulation procedure.
We show that this algorithm is successful, that is, we show that the number of
steps of the algorithm is almost surely finite. We also construct a perfect
simulation procedure for the coupling of a process with a finite number of
neurons and the process with a infinite number of neurons. As a consequence, we
obtain an upper bound for the error that we make when sampling from a finite

population dynamics which broadens the range of biological applications. Our
primary motivation is modelling of immunotherapy of malignant tumours. In this
context the different actors, T-cells, cytokines or cancer cells, are modelled
as single particles (individuals) in the stochastic system. The main expansions
of the model are distinguishing cancer cells by phenotype and genotype,
including environment-dependent phenotypic plasticity that does not affect the
genotype, taking into account the effects of therapy and introducing a
competition term which lowers the reproduction rate of an individual in
addition to the usual term that increases its death rate. We illustrate the new
setup by using it to model various phenomena arising in immunotherapy. Our aim
is twofold: on the one hand, we show that the interplay of genetic mutations
and phenotypic switches on different timescales as well as the occurrence of
metastability phenomena raise new mathematical challenges. On the other hand,
we argue why understanding purely stochastic events (which cannot be obtained
with deterministic models) may help to understand the resistance of tumours to
therapeutic approaches and may have non-trivial consequences on tumour
treatment protocols. This is supported through numerical simulations.

challenge for neuroscience. In particular, the self-organized behavioral
development provides more questions than answers. Are there special functional
units for curiosity, motivation, and creativity? This paper argues that these
features can be grounded in synaptic plasticity itself, without requiring any
higher level constructs. We propose differential extrinsic plasticity (DEP) as
a new synaptic rule for self-learning systems and apply it to a number of
complex robotic systems as a test case. Without specifying any purpose or goal,
seemingly purposeful and adaptive behavior is developed, displaying a certain
level of sensorimotor intelligence. These surprising results require no system
specific modifications of the DEP rule but arise rather from the underlying
mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking due to the tight
brain-body-environment coupling. The new synaptic rule is biologically
plausible and it would be an interesting target for a neurobiolocal
investigation. We also argue that this neuronal mechanism may have been a
catalyst in natural evolution.

  higher dimensions from lower dimensional data"	"  A common statistical situation concerns inferring an unknown distribution
Q(x) from a known distribution P(y), where X (dimension n), and Y (dimension m)
have a known functional relationship. Most commonly, n<m, and the task is
relatively straightforward. For example, if Y1 and Y2 are independent random
variables, each uniform on [0, 1], one can determine the distribution of X = Y1
+ Y2; here m=2 and n=1. However, biological and physical situations can arise
where n>m. In general, in the absence of additional information, there is no
unique solution to Q in those cases. Nevertheless, one may still want to draw
some inferences about Q. To this end, we propose a novel maximum entropy
(MaxEnt) approach that estimates Q(x) based only on the available data, namely,
P(y). The method has the additional advantage that one does not need to
explicitly calculate the Lagrange multipliers. In this paper we develop the
approach, for both discrete and continuous probability distributions, and
demonstrate its validity. We give an intuitive justification as well, and we
illustrate with examples.

organisms and their structural characterization is a hot subject of current
experimental and theoretical research. Computational modeling of the structure
of protein-peptide interactions is usually divided into two stages: prediction
of the binding site at a protein receptor surface, and then docking (and
modeling) the peptide structure into the known binding site. This paper
presents a comprehensive CABS-dock method for the simultaneous search of
binding sites and flexible protein-peptide docking, available as a users
friendly web server. We present example CABS-dock results obtained in the
default CABS-dock mode and using its advanced options that enable the user to
increase the range of flexibility for chosen receptor fragments or to exclude
user-selected binding modes from docking search. Furthermore, we demonstrate a
strategy to improve CABS-dock performance by assessing the quality of models
with classical molecular dynamics. Finally, we discuss the promising extensions
and applications of the CABS-dock method and provide a tutorial appendix for
the convenient analysis and visualization of CABS-dock results. The CABS-dock

structure and the behavior of processes spreading on networks. These include
bond percolation, site percolation, $k$-core percolation, bootstrap
percolation, the generalized epidemic process, and the Watts Threshold Model
(WTM). We show that --- except for bond percolation --- each of these processes
arises as a special case of the WTM and bond percolation arises from a small
modification. In fact ""heterogeneous $k$-core percolation"", a corresponding
""heterogeneous bootstrap percolation"" model, and the generalized epidemic
process are completely equivalent to one another and the WTM. We further show
that a natural generalization of the WTM in which individuals ""transmit"" or
""send a message"" to their neighbors with some probability less than $1$ can be
reformulated in terms of the WTM, and so this apparent generalization is in
fact not more general. Finally, we show that in bond percolation, finding the
set of nodes in the component containing a given node is equivalent to finding
the set of nodes activated if that node is initially activated and the node
thresholds are chosen from the appropriate distribution. A consequence of these
results is that mathematical techniques developed for the WTM apply to these
other models as well, and techniques that were developed for some particular
case may in fact apply much more generally.

increases in SS crowders up to $\phi\approx 0.1$, is considerably more compact
at low volume fractions ($\phi \leq 0.2$) in monodisperse SC particles than in
a medium containing SS particles. A 1:1 mixture of SS and SC crowders induces
greater chain compaction than the pure SS or SC crowders at the same $\phi$
with the effect being highly non-additive. We also discover a counter-intuitive
result that polydisperse crowding environment, mimicking the composition of a
cell lysate, swells the DNA-like polymer, which is in stark contrast to the
size reduction of flexible polymer in the same milieu. Trapping of the stiff
chain in a fluctuating tube-like environment created by large-sized crowders
explains the dramatic increase in size and persistence length of the stiff
chain. In the polydisperse medium, mimicking the cellular environment, the size
of the DNA (or related RNA) is determined by $L/l_p$. At low $L/l_p$ the size
of the polymer is unaffected whereas there is a dramatic swelling at
intermediate value of $L/l_p$. We use these results to provide insights into
recent experiments on crowding effects on RNA, and also make testable
predictions.

  deceleration of the relative fitness"	"  The Lenski experiment investigates the long-term evolution of bacterial
populations. Its design allows the direct comparison of the reproductive
fitness of an evolved strain with its founder ancestor. It was observed by
Wiser et al. (2013) that the relative fitness over time increases sublinearly,
a behaviour which is commonly attributed to effects like clonal interference or
epistasis. In this paper we present an individual-based probabilistic model
that captures essential features of the design of the Lenski experiment. We
assume that each beneficial mutation increases the individual reproduction rate
by a fixed amount, which corresponds to the absence of epistasis in the
continuous-time (intraday) part of the model, but leads to an epistatic effect
in the discrete-time (interday) part of the model. Using an approximation by
near-critical Galton-Watson processes, we prove that under some assumptions on
the model parameters which exclude clonal interference, the relative fitness
process converges, after suitable rescaling, in the large population limit to a
power law function.

1505.02017	q-bio	q-bio.GN	"Evaluation of tools for differential gene expression analysis by RNA-seq
  on a 48 biological replicate experiment"	"  An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of 2 conditions
was performed to determine the number of biological replicates ($n_r$)
required, and to identify the most effective statistical analysis tools for
identifying differential gene expression (DGE). When $n_r=3$, seven of the nine
tools evaluated give true positive rates (TPR) of only 20 to 40 percent. For
high fold-change genes ($|log_{2}(FC)|\gt2$) the TPR is $\gt85$ percent. Two
tools performed poorly; over- or under-predicting the number of differentially
expressed genes. Increasing replication gives a large increase in TPR when
considering all DE genes but only a small increase for high fold-change genes.
Achieving a TPR $\gt85$% across all fold-changes requires $n_r\gt20$. For
future RNA-seq experiments these results suggest $n_r\gt6$, rising to
$n_r\gt12$ when identifying DGE irrespective of fold-change is important. For
$6 \lt n_r \lt 12$, superior TPR makes edgeR the leading tool tested. For $n_r
\ge12$, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq outperforms the
other tools.

ecology discovered in the 20th century. It states that the variance of species
population density scales as a power-law function of the mean population
density. Taylor's power law was named after the British ecologist Lionel Roy
Taylor. During the past half-century, Taylor's power law was confirmed for
thousands of biological species and even for non-biological quantities.
Numerous theories and models have been proposed to explain the mechanisms of
Taylor's power law. However an understanding of the historical origin of this
ubiquitous scaling pattern is lacking. This work reviews two research aspects
that are fundamental to the discovery of Taylor's power law and provides an
outlook of its future studies.

intelligence based on a detailed study of the neocortex. The Heidelberg
Neuromorphic Computing Platform, developed as part of the Human Brain Project
(HBP), is a mixed-signal (analog and digital) large-scale platform for modeling
networks of spiking neurons. In this paper we present the first effort in
porting HTM networks to this platform. We describe a framework for simulating
key HTM operations using spiking network models. We then describe specific
spatial pooling and temporal memory implementations, as well as simulations
demonstrating that the fundamental properties are maintained. We discuss issues
in implementing the full set of plasticity rules using Spike-Timing Dependent
Plasticity (STDP), and rough place and route calculations. Although further
work is required, our initial studies indicate that it should be possible to
run large-scale HTM networks (including plasticity rules) efficiently on the
Heidelberg platform. More generally the exercise of porting high level HTM
algorithms to biophysical neuron models promises to be a fruitful area of
investigation for future studies.

1505.02198	q-bio	q-bio.MN q-bio.PE	Feedback Regulation and its Efficiency in Biochemical Networks	"  Intracellular biochemical networks fluctuate dynamically due to various
internal and external sources of fluctuation. Dissecting the fluctuation into
biologically relevant components is important for understanding how a cell
controls and harnesses noise and how information is transferred over apparently
noisy intracellular networks. While substantial theoretical and experimental
advancement on the decomposition of fluctuation was achieved for feedforward
networks without any loop, we still lack a theoretical basis that can
consistently extend such advancement to feedback networks. The main obstacle
that hampers is the circulative propagation of fluctuation by feedback loops.
In order to define the relevant quantity for the impact of feedback loops for
fluctuation, disentanglement of the causally interlocked influence between the
components is required. In addition, we also lack an approach that enables us
to infer non-perturbatively the influence of the feedback to fluctuation as the
dual reporter system does in the feedforward network. In this work, we resolve
these problems by extending the work on the fluctuation decomposition and the
dual reporter system. For a single-loop feedback network with two components,
we define feedback loop gain as the feedback efficiency that is consistent with
the fluctuation decomposition for feedforward networks. Then, we clarify the
relation of the feedback efficiency with the fluctuation propagation in an
open-looped FF network. Finally, by extending the dual reporter system, we
propose a conjugate feedback and feedforward system for estimating the feedback
efficiency only from the statistics of the system non-perturbatively.

1505.02201	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Fluctuation Relations of Fitness and Information in Population Dynamics	"  Phenotype-switching with and without sensing environment is a ubiquitous
strategy of organisms to survive in fluctuating environment. Fitness of a
population of organisms with phenotype-switching may be constrained and
restricted by hidden relations as the entropy production in a thermal system
with and without sensing and feedback is well-characterized via fluctuation
relations (FRs) . In this work, we derive such FRs of fitness together with an
underlying information-theoretic structure in selection. By using path-integral
formulation of a multi-phenotype population dynamics, we clarify that the
optimal switching strategy is characterized as a consistency condition for
time-forward and backward path probabilities. Within the formulation, the
selection is regarded as passive information compression, and the loss of
fitness from the optimal strategy is shown to satisfy various FRs that
constrain the average and fluctuation of the loss. These results are naturally
extended to the situation that organisms can use an environmental signal by
actively sensing the environment. FRs of fitness gain by sensing are derived in
which the multivariate mutual information among the phenotype, the environment
and the signal plays the role to quantify the relevant information in the
signal for fitness gain.

  information processing in biochemical networks"	"  A central goal of synthetic biology is to design sophisticated synthetic
cellular circuits that can perform complex computations and information
processing tasks in response to specific inputs. The tremendous advances in our
ability to understand and manipulate cellular information processing networks
raises several fundamental physics questions: How do the molecular components
of cellular circuits exploit energy consumption to improve information
processing? Can one utilize ideas from thermodynamics to improve the design of
synthetic cellular circuits and modules? Here, we summarize recent theoretical
work addressing these questions. Energy consumption in cellular circuits serves
five basic purposes: (1) increasing specificity, (2) manipulating dynamics, (3)
reducing variability, (4) amplifying signal, and (5) erasing memory. We
demonstrate these ideas using several simple examples and discuss the
implications of these theoretical ideas for the emerging field of synthetic
biology. We conclude by discussing how it may be possible to overcome these
limitations using ""post-translational"" synthetic biology that exploits
reversible protein modification.

1505.02492	q-bio	q-bio.PE math.DS	A fractional order recovery SIR model from a stochastic process	"  Over the past several decades there has been a proliferation of
epidemiological models with ordinary derivatives replaced by fractional
derivatives in an an-hoc manner. These models may be mathematically interesting
but their relevance is uncertain. Here we develop an SIR model for an epidemic,
including vital dynamics, from an underlying stochastic process. We show how
fractional differential operators arise naturally in these models whenever the
recovery time from the disease is power law distributed. This can provide a
model for a chronic disease process where individuals who are infected for a
long time are unlikely to recover. The fractional order recovery model is shown
to be consistent with the Kermack-McKendrick age-structured SIR model and it
reduces to the Hethcote-Tudor integral equation SIR model. The derivation from
a stochastic process is extended to discrete time, providing a stable numerical
method for solving the model equations. We have carried out simulations of the
fractional order recovery model showing convergence to equilibrium states. The
number of infecteds in the endemic equilibrium state increases as the
fractional order of the derivative tends to zero.

that continues to defy detailed understanding. Near the onset to turbulence in
pipes, transient turbulent regions decay either directly or, at higher Reynolds
numbers through splitting, with characteristic time-scales that exhibit a
super-exponential dependence on Reynolds number. Here we report numerical
simulations of transitional pipe flow, showing that a zonal flow emerges at
large scales, activated by anisotropic turbulent fluctuations; in turn, the
zonal flow suppresses the small-scale turbulence leading to stochastic
predator-prey dynamics. We show that this ""ecological"" model of transitional
turbulence reproduces the super-exponential lifetime statistics and
phenomenology of pipe flow experiments. Our work demonstrates that a fluid on
the edge of turbulence is mathematically analogous to an ecosystem on the edge
of extinction, and provides an unbroken link between the equations of fluid
dynamics and the directed percolation universality class.

  biological networks"	"  Biological information processing networks consist of many components, which
are coupled by an even larger number of complex multivariate interactions.
However, analyses of data sets from fields as diverse as neuroscience,
molecular biology, and behavior have reported that observed statistics of
states of some biological networks can be approximated well by maximum entropy
models with only pairwise interactions among the components. Based on
simulations of random Ising spin networks with $p$-spin ($p>2$) interactions,
here we argue that this reduction in complexity can be thought of as a natural
property of densely interacting networks in certain regimes, and not
necessarily as a special property of living systems. By connecting our analysis
to the theory of random constraint satisfaction problems, we suggest a reason
for why some biological systems may operate in this regime.

Master Equation (CME) depends on many parameters, rendering explicit simulation
an inefficient method for exploring the properties of such models. Capturing
their behaviour by low-dimensional models makes analysis of system behaviour
tractable. In this paper, we present low dimensional models for the
noise-induced excitable dynamics in Bacillus subtilis, whereby a key protein
ComK, which drives a complex chain of reactions leading to bacterial
competence, gets expressed rapidly in large quantities (competent state) before
subsiding to low levels of expression (vegetative state). These rapid reactions
suggest the application of an adiabatic approximation of the dynamics of the
regulatory model that, however, lead to competence durations that are incorrect
by a factor of 2. We apply a modified version of an iterative functional
procedure that faithfully approximates the time-course of the trajectories in
terms of a 2-dimensional model involving proteins ComK and ComS. Furthermore,
in order to describe the bimodal bivariate marginal probability distribution
obtained from the Gillespie simulations of the CME, we introduce a tunable
multiplicative noise term in a 2-dimensional Langevin model whose stationary
state is described by the time-independent solution of the corresponding
Fokker-Planck equation.

addressed under a dual perspective. By means of duality arguments an integer
linear system is defined whose solution space is the dual of the Gardner space
and whose solutions represent mutually unstable patterns. We propose and
discuss Monte Carlo methods in order to find and remove unstable patterns and

the emergence of phase dominated by unstable patterns can be triggered in a
non-linear discontinuous way.

provinces and glaciations, all of which have been considered as contributors to
mass extinctions. Understanding the overall relationship between the timings of
the largest extinctions and their potential proximal causes remains one of
science's great unsolved mysteries. Cycles of about 60 million years in both
fossil diversity and environmental data suggest external drivers such as the
passage of the Solar System through the galactic plane. While cyclic phenomena
are recognised statistically, a lack of coherent mechanisms and a failure to
link key events has hampered wider acceptance of multi-million year periodicity
and its relevance to earth science and evolution. The generation of a robust
predictive model of timings, with a clear plausible primary mechanism, would
signal a paradigm shift. Here, we present a model of the timings of globally
disruptive events and a possible explanation of their ultimate cause. The
proposed model is a symmetrical pattern of 63 million-year sequences around a
central value, interpreted as the occurrence of events along, and parallel to,
the galactic midplane. The symmetry is consistent with multiple dark matter
disks, aligned parallel to the midplane. One implication of the precise pattern
of timings and the underlying physical model is the ability to predict future
events, such as a major extinction in one to two million years.

phenotypic variability and feedbacks between population and single cells are

1505.03176	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Firing Rate Dynamics in Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks with Intrinsic
  and Network Heterogeneity"	"  Heterogeneity of neural attributes has recently gained a lot of attention and
is increasing recognized as a crucial feature in neural processing. Despite its
importance, this physiological feature has traditionally been neglected in
theoretical studies of cortical neural networks. Thus, there is still a lot
unknown about the consequences of cellular and circuit heterogeneity in spiking
neural networks. In particular, combining network or synaptic heterogeneity and
intrinsic heterogeneity has yet to be considered systematically despite the
fact that both are known to exist and likely have significant roles in neural
network dynamics. In a canonical recurrent spiking neural network model, we
study how these two forms of heterogeneity lead to different distributions of
excitatory firing rates. To analytically characterize how these types of
heterogeneities affect the network, we employ a dimension reduction method that
relies on a combination of Monte Carlo simulations and probability density
function equations. We find that the relationship between intrinsic and network
heterogeneity has a strong effect on the overall level of heterogeneity of the
firing rates. Specifically, this relationship can lead to amplification or
attenuation of firing rate heterogeneity, and these effects depend on whether
the recurrent network is firing asynchronously or rhythmically firing. These
observations are captured with the aforementioned reduction method, and
furthermore simpler analytic descriptions based on this dimension reduction
method are developed. The final analytic descriptions provide compact and
descriptive formulas for how the relationship between intrinsic and network
heterogeneity determines the firing rate heterogeneity dynamics in various
settings.

  increase with force"	"  Helicases, involved in a number of cellular functions, are motors that
translocate along singlestranded nucleic acid and couple the motion to
unwinding double-strands of a duplex nucleic acid. The junction between double
and single strands creates a barrier to the movement of the helicase, which can
be manipulated in vitro by applying mechanical forces directly on the nucleic
acid strands. Single molecule experiments have demonstrated that the unwinding
velocities of some helicases increase dramatically with increase in the
external force, while others show little response. In contrast, the unwinding
processivity always increases when the force increases. The differing responses
of the unwinding velocity and processivity to force has lacked explanation. By
generalizing a previous model of processive unwinding by helicases, we provide
a unified framework for understanding the dependence of velocity and
processivity on force and the nucleic acid sequence. We predict that the
sensitivity of unwinding processivity to external force is a universal feature
that should be observed in all helicases. Our prediction is illustrated using
T7 and NS3 helicases as case studies. Interestingly, the increase in unwinding
processivity with force depends on whether the helicase forces base pair
opening by direct interaction or if such a disruption occurs spontaneously due
to thermal uctuations. Based on the theoretical results, we propose that
proteins like single-strand binding proteins associated with helicases in the
replisome, may have co-evolved with helicases to increase the unwinding
processivity even if the velocity remains unaffected.

currently known bounds regarding this conjecture, in particular we show that
the maximum is at most $(0.69 +o(1))\binom{n}{4}$. We also give further

1505.04346	q-bio	q-bio.MN physics.bio-ph q-bio.CB	"Limits to the precision of gradient sensing with spatial communication
  and temporal integration"	"  Gradient sensing requires at least two measurements at different points in
space. These measurements must then be communicated to a common location to be
compared, which is unavoidably noisy. While much is known about the limits of
measurement precision by cells, the limits placed by the communication are not
understood. Motivated by recent experiments, we derive the fundamental limits
to the precision of gradient sensing in a multicellular system, accounting for
communication and temporal integration. The gradient is estimated by comparing
a ""local"" and a ""global"" molecular reporter of the external concentration,
where the global reporter is exchanged between neighboring cells. Using the
fluctuation-dissipation framework, we find, in contrast to the case when
communication is ignored, that precision saturates with the number of cells
independently of the measurement time duration, since communication establishes
a maximum lengthscale over which sensory information can be reliably conveyed.
Surprisingly, we also find that precision is improved if the local reporter is
exchanged between cells as well, albeit more slowly than the global reporter.
The reason is that while exchange of the local reporter weakens the comparison,
it decreases the measurement noise. We term such a model ""regional
excitation--global inhibition"" (REGI). Our results demonstrate that fundamental
sensing limits are necessarily sharpened when the need to communicate
information is taken into account.

1505.04368	q-bio	q-bio.NC cs.IT math.IT	Measuring integrated information from the decoding perspective	"  Accumulating evidence indicates that the capacity to integrate information in
the brain is a prerequisite for consciousness. Integrated Information Theory
(IIT) of consciousness provides a mathematical approach to quantifying the
information integrated in a system, called integrated information, $\Phi$.
Integrated information is defined theoretically as the amount of information a
system generates as a whole, above and beyond the sum of the amount of
information its parts independently generate. IIT predicts that the amount of
integrated information in the brain should reflect levels of consciousness.
Empirical evaluation of this theory requires computing integrated information
from neural data acquired from experiments, although difficulties with using
the original measure $\Phi$ precludes such computations. Although some
practical measures have been previously proposed, we found that these measures
fail to satisfy the theoretical requirements as a measure of integrated
information. Measures of integrated information should satisfy the lower and
upper bounds as follows: The lower bound of integrated information should be 0
when the system does not generate information (no information) or when the
system comprises independent parts (no integration). The upper bound of
integrated information is the amount of information generated by the whole
system and is realized when the amount of information generated independently
by its parts equals to 0. Here we derive the novel practical measure $\Phi^*$
by introducing a concept of mismatched decoding developed from information
theory. We show that $\Phi^*$ is properly bounded from below and above, as
required, as a measure of integrated information. We derive the analytical
expression $\Phi^*$ under the Gaussian assumption, which makes it readily
applicable to experimental data.

turnover times. However the latter are inferred from net fluxes, and we argue
that this approximation is not valid for enzymes working nearby thermodynamic

theorem. We find in many cases values one of order of magnitude lower, implying
a faster picture of intermediate metabolism.

and exploits interesting connections between evolutionary game theory and
random polynomial theory. The main novelties of the paper are some qualitative
and quantitative results on the expected density, $f_{n,d}$, and the expected
number, $E(n,d)$, of (stable) internal equilibria. Firstly, we show that in
multi-player two-strategy games, they behave asymptotically as $\sqrt{d-1}$ as
$d$ is sufficiently large. Secondly, we prove that they are monotone functions
of $d$. We also make a conjecture for games with more than two strategies.
Thirdly, we provide numerical simulations for our analytical results and to

  Dual-Objective Optimization Design"	"  Multiple-objective optimization is common in biological systems. In the
mammalian olfactory system, each sensory neuron stochastically expresses only
one out of up to thousands of olfactory receptor (OR) gene alleles; at organism
level the types of expressed ORs need to be maximized. Existing models focus
only on monoallele activation, and cannot explain recent observations in
mutants, especially the reduced global diversity of expressed ORs in G9a/GLP
knockouts. In this work we integrated existing information on OR expression,
and constructed a comprehensive model that has all its components based on
physical interactions. Analyzing the model reveals an evolutionarily optimized
three-layer regulation mechanism, which includes zonal segregation, epigenetic
barrier crossing coupled to a negative feedback loop that mechanistically
differs from previous theoretical proposals, and a previously unidentified
enhancer competition step. This model not only recapitulates monoallelic OR
expression, but also elucidates how the olfactory system maximizes and
maintains the diversity of OR expression, and has multiple predictions
validated by existing experimental results. Through making analogy to a
physical system with thermally activated barrier crossing and comparative
reverse engineering analyses, the study reveals that the olfactory receptor
selection system is optimally designed, and particularly underscores
cooperativity and synergy as a general design principle for multi-objective
optimization in biology.

used in studies of enzymatic catalysis. Until recently, it has been cost
prohibitive to determine the asymptotic limit of key energetic and structural
properties with respect to increasingly large QM regions. Leveraging recent
advances in electronic structure efficiency and accuracy, we investigate
catalytic properties in catechol O-methyltransferase, a representative example
of a methyltransferase critical to human health. Using QM regions ranging in
size from reactants-only (64 atoms) to nearly one-third of the entire protein
(940 atoms), we show that properties such as the activation energy approach
within chemical accuracy of the large-QM asymptotic limits rather slowly,
requiring approximately 500-600 atoms if the QM residues are chosen simply by
distance from the substrate. This slow approach to asymptotic limit is due to
charge transfer from protein residues to the reacting substrates. Our large
QM/MM calculations enable identification of charge separation for fragments in
the transition state as a key component of enzymatic methyl transfer rate
enhancement. We introduce charge shift analysis that reveals the minimum number
of protein residues (ca. 11-16 residues or 200-300 atoms for COMT) needed for
quantitative agreement with large-QM simulations. The identified residues are
not those that would be typically selected using criteria such as chemical
intuition or proximity. These results provide a recipe for a more careful

interpretable and comprehensive analyses that can capture complex phylogenetic

horizontal gene transfer constitute examples of pervasive biological phenomena
that cannot be captured by tree-like representations. Starting from hundreds of

represent potential histories that explicitly accommodate recombination and
mutation events across orthologous genomes. However, they are computationally
costly to reconstruct, usually being infeasible for more than few tens of
genomes. Recently, Topological Data Analysis (TDA) methods have been proposed
as robust and scalable methods that can capture the genetic scale and frequency
of recombination. We build upon previous TDA developments for detecting and
quantifying recombination, and present a novel framework that can be applied to
hundreds of genomes and can be interpreted in terms of minimal histories of
mutation and recombination events, quantifying the scales and identifying the
genomic locations of recombinations. We implement this framework in a software
package, called TARGet, and apply it to several examples, including small
migration between different populations, human recombination, and horizontal
evolution in finches inhabiting the Gal\'apagos Islands.

structure of this nanomachine, which drives locomotion in a wide range of
bacterial species, is more dynamic than previously believed. Specifically, the
number of active torque-generating units (stators) was shown to vary across
applied loads. This finding invalidates the experimental evidence reporting
that limiting (zero-torque) speed is independent of the number of active
stators. Here, we propose that, contrary to previous assumptions, the maximum
speed of the motor is not universal, but rather increases as additional
torque-generators are recruited. This result arises from our assumption that
stators disengage from the motor for a significant portion of their
mechanochemical cycles at low loads. We show that this assumption is consistent
with current experimental evidence and consolidate our predictions with
arguments that a processive motor must have a high duty ratio at high loads.

secondary structure comparison. However, the usual representation of tree
alignments as supertrees is ambiguous, i.e. two distinct supertrees may induce
identical sets of matches between identical pairs of trees. This ambiguity is
uninformative, and detrimental to any probabilistic analysis.In this work, we
consider tree alignments up to equivalence. Our first result is a precise
asymptotic enumeration of tree alignments, obtained from a context-free grammar
by mean of basic analytic combinatorics. Our second result focuses on
alignments between two given ordered trees $S$ and $T$. By refining our grammar
to align specific trees, we obtain a decomposition scheme for the space of
alignments, and use it to design an efficient dynamic programming algorithm for
sampling alignments under the Gibbs-Boltzmann probability distribution. This
generalizes existing tree alignment algorithms, and opens the door for a
probabilistic analysis of the space of suboptimal RNA secondary structures
alignments.

  Networks"	"  Maximum parsimony is one of the most frequently-discussed tree reconstruction
methods in phylogenetic estimation. However, in recent years it has become more
and more apparent that phylogenetic trees are often not sufficient to describe
evolution accurately. For instance, processes like hybridization or lateral
gene transfer that are commonplace in many groups of organisms and result in
mosaic patterns of relationships cannot be represented by a single phylogenetic
tree. This is why phylogenetic networks, which can display such events, are
becoming of more and more interest in phylogenetic research. It is therefore
necessary to extend concepts like maximum parsimony from phylogenetic trees to
networks. Several suggestions for possible extensions can be found in recent
literature, for instance the softwired and the hardwired parsimony concepts. In
this paper, we analyze the so-called big parsimony problem under these two
concepts, i.e. we investigate maximum parsimonious networks and analyze their
properties. In particular, we show that finding a softwired maximum parsimony
network is possible in polynomial time. We also show that the set of maximum
parsimony networks for the hardwired definition always contains at least one
phylogenetic tree. Lastly, we investigate some parallels of parsimony to
different likelihood concepts on phylogenetic networks.

  Response"	"  The 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa raised many questions about the
control of infectious disease in an increasingly connected global society.
Limited availability of contact information made contact tracing difficult or
impractical in combating the outbreak. We consider the development of
multi-scale public health strategies and simulate policies for community-level
response aimed at early screening of communities rather than individuals, as
well as travel restrictions to prevent community cross-contamination. Our
analysis shows the policies to be effective even at a relatively low level of
compliance. In our simulations, 40% of individuals conforming to these policies
is enough to stop the outbreak. Simulations with a 50% compliance rate are
consistent with the case counts in Liberia during the period of rapid decline
after mid September, 2014. We also find the travel restriction to be effective
at reducing the risks associated with compliance substantially below the 40%
level, shortening the outbreak and enabling efforts to be focused on affected
areas. Our results suggest that the multi-scale approach can be used to further
evolve public health strategy for defeating emerging epidemics.

1505.07133	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio.SC	"Elastohydrodynamics and kinetics of protein patterning in the
  immunological synapse"	"  The cellular basis for the adaptive immune response during antigen
recognition relies on a specialized protein interface known as the
immunological synapse (IS). Understanding the biophysical basis for protein
patterning by deciphering the quantitative rules for their formation and motion
is an important aspect of characterizing immune cell recognition and thence the
rules for immune system activation. We propose a minimal mathematical model for
the physical basis of membrane protein patterning in the IS, which encompass
membrane mechanics, protein binding kinetics and motion, and fluid flow in the
synaptic cleft. Our theory leads to simple predictions for the spatial and
temporal scales of protein cluster formation, growth and arrest as a function
of membrane stiffness, rigidity and kinetics of the adhesive proteins, and the
fluid in the synaptic cleft. Numerical simulations complement these scaling
laws by quantifying the nucleation, growth and stabilization of proteins
domains on the size of the cell. Direct comparison with experiment shows that
passive elastohydrodynamics and kinetics of protein binding in the synaptic
cleft can describe the short-time formation and organization of protein
clusters, without evoking any active processes in the cytoskeleton. Despite the
apparent complexity of the process, our analysis highlights the role of just
two dimensionless parameters that characterize the spatial and temporal
evolution of the protein pattern: a ratio of membrane elasticity to protein
elasticity, and the ratio of a hydrodynamic time scale for fluid flow relative
to the protein binding rate, and we present a simple phase diagram that
encompasses the variety of patterns that can arise.

1505.07335	q-bio	q-bio.MN cs.CE cs.SI	A Novel Algorithm for the Maximal Fit Problem in Boolean Networks	"  Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are increasingly used for explaining
biological processes with complex transcriptional regulation. A GRN links the
expression levels of a set of genes via regulatory controls that gene products
exert on one another. Boolean networks are a common modeling choice since they
balance between detail and ease of analysis. However, even for Boolean networks
the problem of fitting a given network model to an expression dataset is
NP-Complete. Previous methods have addressed this issue heuristically or by
focusing on acyclic networks and specific classes of regulation functions. In
this paper we introduce a novel algorithm for this problem that makes use of
sampling in order to handle large datasets. Our algorithm can handle time
series data for any network type and steady state data for acyclic networks.
Using in-silico time series data we demonstrate good performance on large
datasets with a significant level of noise.

  structures"	"  Self-assembly in the laboratory can now yield `information-rich'
nanostructures in which each component is of a distinct type and has a defined
spatial position. Ensuring the thermodynamic stability of such structures
requires inter-component interaction energies to increase logarithmically with
structure size, in order to counter the entropy gained upon mixing component
types in solution. However, self-assembly in the presence of strong
interactions results in general in kinetic trapping, so suggesting a limit to
the size of an (equilibrium) structure that can be self-assembled from
distinguishable components. Here we study numerically a two-dimensional
hierarchical assembly scheme already considered in experiment. We show that
this scheme is immune to the kinetic traps associated with strong `native'
interactions (interactions designed to stabilize the intended structure), and
so, in principle, offers a way to make large information-rich structures. In
this scheme the size of an assembled structure scales exponentially with the
stage of assembly, and assembly can continue as long as random motion is able
to bring structures into contact. The resulting superstructure could provide a
template for building in the third dimension. The chief drawback of this scheme
is that it is particularly susceptible to kinetic traps that result from
`non-native' interactions (interactions not required to stabilize the intended
structure); the scale on which such a scheme can be realized therefore depends
upon how effectively this latter kind of interaction can be suppressed.

1505.07526	q-bio	q-bio.SC cond-mat.stat-mech stat.AP	Energy dissipation in an adaptive molecular circuit	"  The ability to monitor nutrient and other environmental conditions with high
sensitivity is crucial for cell growth and survival. Sensory adaptation allows
a cell to recover its sensitivity after a transient response to a shift in the
strength of extracellular stimulus. The working principles of adaptation have
been established previously based on rate equations which do not consider
fluctuations in a thermal environment. Recently, G. Lan et al. (Nature Phys.,
8:422-8, 2012) performed a detailed analysis of a stochastic model for the E.
coli sensory network. They showed that accurate adaptation is possible only
when the system operates in a nonequilibrium steady-state (NESS). They further
proposed an energy-speed-accuracy (ESA) trade-off relation. We present here
analytic results on the NESS of the model through a mapping to a
one-dimensional birth-death process. An exact expression for the entropy
production rate is also derived. Based on these results, we are able to discuss
the ESA relation in a more general setting. Our study suggests that the
adaptation error can be reduced exponentially as the methylation range
increases. Finally, we show that a nonequilibrium phase transition exists in
the infinite methylation range limit, despite the fact that the model contains
only two discrete variables.

1505.07821	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Genetic correlations greatly increase mutational robustness and can both
  reduce and enhance evolvability"	"  Mutational neighbourhoods in genotype-phenotype (GP) maps are widely believed
to be more likely to share characteristics than expected from random chance.
Such genetic correlations should, as John Maynard Smith famously pointed out,
strongly influence evolutionary dynamics. We explore and quantify these
intuitions by comparing three GP maps - RNA SS, HP for tertiary, Polyominoes
for protein quaternary structure - to a simple random null model that maintains
the number of genotypes mapping to each phenotype, but assigns genotypes
randomly. The mutational neighbourhood of a genotype in these GP maps is much
more likely to contain (mutationally neutral) genotypes mapping to the same
phenotype than in the random null model. These neutral correlations can
increase the robustness to mutations by orders of magnitude over that of the
null model, raising robustness above the critical threshold for the formation
of large neutral networks that enhance the capacity for neutral exploration. We
also study {\em non-neutral correlations}: Compared to the null model, i) If a
particular (non-neutral) phenotype is found once in the 1-mutation
neighbourhood of a genotype, then the chance of finding that phenotype multiple
times in this neighbourhood is larger than expected; ii) If two genotypes are
connected by a single neutral mutation, then their respective non-neutral
1-mutation neighbourhoods are more likely to be similar; iii) If a genotype
maps to a folding or self-assembling phenotype, then its non-neutral neighbours
are less likely to be a potentially deleterious non-folding or non-assembling
phenotype. Non-neutral correlations of type i) and ii) reduce the rate at which
new phenotypes can be found by neutral exploration, and so may diminish
evolvability, while non-neutral correlations of type iii) may instead
facilitate evolutionary exploration and so increase evolvability.

1505.07866	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Learning universal computations with spikes	"  Providing the neurobiological basis of information processing in higher
animals, spiking neural networks must be able to learn a variety of complicated
computations, including the generation of appropriate, possibly delayed
reactions to inputs and the self-sustained generation of complex activity
patterns, e.g.~for locomotion. Many such computations require previous building
of intrinsic world models. Here we show how spiking neural networks may solve
these different tasks. Firstly, we derive constraints under which classes of
spiking neural networks lend themselves to substrates of powerful general
purpose computing. The networks contain dendritic or synaptic nonlinearities
and have a constrained connectivity. We then combine such networks with
learning rules for outputs or recurrent connections. We show that this allows
to learn even difficult benchmark tasks such as the self-sustained generation
of desired low-dimensional chaotic dynamics or memory-dependent computations.
Furthermore, we show how spiking networks can build models of external world
systems and use the acquired knowledge to control them.

  parallel experiments"	"  A fundamental aspect of biological information processing is the ubiquity of
sequence-function relationships -- functions that map the sequence of DNA, RNA,
or protein to a biochemically relevant activity. Most sequence-function
relationships in biology are quantitative, but only recently have experimental
techniques for effectively measuring these relationships been developed. The
advent of such ""massively parallel"" experiments presents an exciting
opportunity for the concepts and methods of statistical physics to inform the
study of biological systems. After reviewing these recent experimental
advances, we focus on the problem of how to infer parametric models of
sequence-function relationships from the data produced by these experiments.
Specifically, we retrace and extend recent theoretical work showing that
inference based on mutual information, not the standard likelihood-based
approach, is often necessary for accurately learning the parameters of these
models. Closely connected with this result is the emergence of ""diffeomorphic
modes"" -- directions in parameter space that are far less constrained by data
than likelihood-based inference would suggest. Analogous to Goldstone modes in
physics, diffeomorphic modes arise from an arbitrarily broken symmetry of the
inference problem. An analytically tractable model of a massively parallel
experiment is then described, providing an explicit demonstration of these
fundamental aspects of statistical inference. This paper concludes with an
outlook on the theoretical and computational challenges currently facing
studies of quantitative sequence-function relationships.

  systematic evaluation of the impact of the cross-linking spacer length"	"  Recent development of high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) instruments
enables chemical cross-linking (XL) to become a high-throughput method for
obtaining structural information about proteins. Restraints derived from XL-MS
experiments have been used successfully for structure refinement and
protein-protein docking. However, one formidable question is under which
circumstances XL-MS data might be sufficient to determine a protein's tertiary
structure de novo? Answering this question will not only include understanding
the impact of XL-MS data on sampling and scoring within a de novo protein
structure prediction algorithm, it must also determine an optimal cross-linker
type and length for protein structure determination. While a longer
cross-linker will yield more restraints, the value of each restraint for
protein structure prediction decreases as the restraint is consistent with a
larger conformational space.
  In this study, the number of cross-links and their discriminative power was
systematically analyzed in silico on a set of 2,055 non-redundant protein folds
considering Lys-Lys, Lys-Asp, Lys-Glu, Cys-Cys, and Arg-Arg reactive
cross-linkers between 1 {\AA} and 60 {\AA}. Depending on the protein size a
heuristic was developed that determines the optimal cross-linker length. Next,
simulated restraints of variable length were used to de novo predict the
tertiary structure of fifteen proteins using the BCL::Fold algorithm. The
results demonstrate that a distinct cross-linker length exists for which
information content for de novo protein structure prediction is maximized. The
sampling accuracy improves on average by 1.0 {\AA} and up to 2.2 {\AA} in the
most prominent example. XL-MS restraints enable consistently an improved
selection of native-like models with an average enrichment of 2.1.

1506.00681	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio.CB	Mechanism for collective cell alignment in Myxococcus xanthus bacteria	"  Myxococcus xanthus cells self-organize into aligned groups, clusters, at
various stages of their lifecycle. Formation of these clusters is crucial for
the complex dynamic multi-cellular behavior of these bacteria. However, the
mechanism underlying the cell alignment and clustering is not fully understood.
Motivated by studies of clustering in self-propelled rods, we hypothesized that
M. xanthus cells can align and form clusters through pure mechanical
interactions among cells and between cells and substrate. We test this
hypothesis using an agent-based simulation framework in which each agent is
based on the biophysical model of an individual M. xanthus cell. We show that
model agents, under realistic cell flexibility values, can align and form cell
clusters but only when periodic reversals of cell directions are suppressed.
However, by extending our model to introduce the observed ability of cells to
deposit and follow slime trails, we show that effective trail-following leads
to clusters in reversing cells. Furthermore, we conclude that mechanical cell
alignment combined with slime-trail-following is sufficient to explain the
distinct clustering behaviors observed for wild-type and non-reversing M.
xanthus mutants in recent experiments. Our results are robust to variation in
model parameters, match the experimentally observed trends and can be applied
to understand surface motility patterns of other bacterial species.

  organization"	"  Recent experiments showing scaling of the intrachromosomal contact
probability, $P(s)\sim s^{-1}$ with the genomic distance $s$, are interpreted
to mean a self-similar fractal-like chromosome organization. However, scaling
of $P(s)$ varies across organisms, requiring an explanation. We illustrate
dynamical arrest in a highly confined space as a discriminating marker for
genome organization, by modeling chromosome inside a nucleus as a homopolymer
confined to a sphere of varying sizes. Brownian dynamics simulations show that
the chain dynamics slows down as the polymer volume fraction ($\phi$) inside
the confinement approaches a critical value $\phi_c$. The universal value of
$\phi_c^{\infty}\approx 0.44$ for a sufficiently long polymer ($N\gg 1$) allows
us to discuss genome dynamics using $\phi$ as a single parameter. Our study
shows that the onset of glassy dynamics is the reason for the segregated
chromosome organization in human ($N\approx 3\times 10^9$,
$\phi\gtrsim\phi_c^{\infty}$), whereas chromosomes of budding yeast ($N\approx
10^8$, $\phi<\phi_c^{\infty}$) are equilibrated with no clear signature of such
organization.

  life in subsurface environments in the Universe"	"  Photosynthesis is a mechanism developed by terrestrial life to utilize the
energy from photons of solar origin for biological use. Subsurface regions are
isolated from the photosphere, and consequently are incapable of utilizing this
energy. This opens up the opportunity for life to evolve alternate mechanisms
for harvesting available energy. Bacterium Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator,
found 2.8 km deep in a South African mine, harvests energy from radiolysis,
induced by particles emitted from radioactive U, Th and K present in
surrounding rock. Another radiation source in the subsurface environments is
secondary particles generated by Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs). Using Monte Carlo
simulations, it is shown that it is a steady source of energy comparable to
that produced by radioactive substances, and the possibility of a slow
metabolizing life flourishing on it cannot be ruled out. Two mechanisms are
proposed through which GCR-induced secondary particles can be utilized for
biological use in subsurface environments: (1) GCRs injecting energy in the
environment through particle-induced radiolysis, and (2) organic synthesis from
GCR secondaries interacting with the medium. Laboratory experiments to test
these hypotheses are also proposed. Implications of these mechanisms on finding
life in the Solar System and elsewhere in the Universe are discussed.

vein, the value of Neutral Theory (NT) has been the subject of much debate over
the past 15 years. NT was proposed at the turn of the century by Stephen
Hubbell to explain pervasive patterns observed in the organization of
ecosystems. Its originally tepid reception among ecologists contrasted starkly
with the excitement it caused among physicists and mathematicians. Indeed, NT
spawned several theoretical studies that attempted to explain empirical data
and predicted trends of quantities that had not yet been studied. While there
are a few reviews of NT oriented towards ecologists, our goal here is to review
the quantitative results of NT and its extensions for physicists who are
interested in learning what NT is, what its successes are and what important
problems remain unresolved. Furthermore, we hope that this review could also be
of interest to theoretical ecologists because many potentially interesting
results are buried in the vast NT literature. We propose to make these more
accessible by extracting them and presenting them in a logical fashion. We
conclude the review by discussing how one might introduce realistic non-neutral

as likely an important factor shaping natural ecosystems. This work builds on
MacArthur's classic model of competitive coexistence to investigate such
community-level competition in a minimal theoretical setting. It is shown that
the ability of a species to survive a coalescence event is best predicted by a
community-level ""fitness"" of its native community rather than the intrinsic
performance of the species itself. The model presented here allows formalizing
a macroscopic perspective whereby a community harboring organisms at varying
abundances becomes equivalent to a single organism expressing genes at
different levels. While most natural communities do not satisfy the strict
criteria of multicellularity developed by multi-level selection theory, the
effective cohesion described here is a generic consequence of division of
labor, requires no cooperative interactions, and can be expected to be
widespread in microbial ecosystems.

  integrating direct coupling and insertions"	"  The multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of a protein family provides a wealth
of information in terms of the conservation pattern of amino acid residues not
only at each alignment site but also between distant sites. In order to
statistically model the MSA incorporating both short-range and long-range
correlations as well as insertions, I have derived a lattice gas model of the
MSA based on the principle of maximum entropy. The partition function, obtained
by the transfer matrix method with a mean-field approximation, accounts for all
possible alignments with all possible sequences. The model parameters for
short-range and long-range interactions were determined by a self-consistent
condition and by a Gaussian approximation, respectively. Using this model with
and without long-range interactions, I analyzed the globin and V-set domains by
increasing the ""temperature"" and by ""mutating"" a site. The correlations between
residue conservation and various measures of the system's stability indicate
that the long-range interactions make the conservation pattern more specific to
the structure, and increasingly stabilize better conserved residues.

mapping). Importantly though, the same neural system can be activated by
inherently different tasks. To date, there is no approach available that
systematically explores whether and how distinct tasks probe the same neural
system (many tasks-to-region mapping). In our work, presented here we propose
an alternative framework, the Automatic Neuroscientist, which turns the typical
fMRI approach on its head. We use real-time fMRI in combination with
state-of-the-art optimisation techniques to automatically design the optimal
experiment to evoke a desired target brain state. Here, we present two
proof-of-principle studies involving visual and auditory stimuli. The data
demonstrate this closed-loop approach to be very powerful, hugely speeding up
fMRI and providing an accurate estimation of the underlying relationship
between stimuli and neural responses across an extensive experimental parameter
space. Finally, we detail four scenarios where our approach can be applied,
suggesting how it provides a novel description of how cognition and the brain
interrelate.

Foerster equation have been extensively studied but they are structurally
unable to describe stochastic fluctuations or population-size-dependent birth
and death rates. Stochastic theories that treat semi-Markov age-dependent
processes using e.g., the Bellman-Harris equation, do not resolve a
population's age-structure and are unable to quantify population-size
dependencies. Conversely, current theories that include size-dependent
population dynamics (e.g., mathematical models that include carrying capacity
such as the Logistic equation) cannot be easily extended to take into account
age-dependent birth and death rates. In this paper, we present a systematic
derivation of a new fully stochastic kinetic theory for interacting
age-structured populations. By defining multiparticle probability density
functions, we derive a hierarchy of kinetic equations for the stochastic
evolution of an ageing population undergoing birth and death. We show that the
fully stochastic age-dependent birth-death process precludes factorization of
the corresponding probability densities, which then must be solved by using a
BBGKY-like hierarchy. However, explicit solutions are derived in two simple
limits and compared with their corresponding mean-field results. Our results
generalize both deterministic models and existing master equation approaches by
providing an intuitive and efficient way to simultaneously model age- and
population-dependent stochastic dynamics applicable to the study of demography,
stem cell dynamics, and disease evolution.

  their dynamic neural activation patterns measured with MEG"	"  Perceptual similarity is a cognitive judgment that represents the end-stage
of a complex cascade of hierarchical processing throughout visual cortex.
Previous studies have shown a correspondence between the similarity of
coarse-scale fMRI activation patterns and the perceived similarity of visual
stimuli, suggesting that visual objects that appear similar also share similar
underlying patterns of neural activation. Here we explore the temporal
relationship between the human brain's time-varying representation of visual
patterns and behavioral judgments of perceptual similarity. The visual stimuli
were abstract patterns constructed from identical perceptual units (oriented
Gabor patches) so that each pattern had a unique global form or perceptual
'Gestalt'. The visual stimuli were decodable from evoked neural activation
patterns measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG), however, stimuli differed
in the similarity of their neural representation as estimated by differences in
decodability. Early after stimulus onset (from 50ms), a model based on
retinotopic organization predicted the representational similarity of the
visual stimuli. Following the peak correlation between the retinotopic model
and neural data at 80ms, the neural representations quickly evolved so that
retinotopy no longer provided a sufficient account of the brain's time-varying
representation of the stimuli. Overall the strongest predictor of the brain's
representation was a model based on human judgments of perceptual similarity,
which reached the limits of the maximum correlation with the neural data
defined by the 'noise ceiling'. Our results show that large-scale brain
activation patterns contain a neural signature for the perceptual Gestalt of
composite visual features, and demonstrate a strong correspondence between
perception and complex patterns of brain activity.

emphasize a perspective based on dynamical phases that can explain
commonalities shared by these mechanisms. Dynamical phases are defined by
typical trajectories executed by non-equilibrium systems in the space of

consequences for function vs free energy cost trade-offs. Dynamical phases can

other applications, e.g. when a small number of 'experts' are diluted by a
large number of noisy, unreliable participants. We develop a new EM algorithm
that is driven by these experts. In a manner that differs from other
approaches, we start from a single mixture class. The algorithm then develops
the set of 'experts' in a stagewise fashion based on a mutual information
criterion. At each stage EM operates on this subset of the players, effectively
regularizing the E rather than the M step. Experiments show that stagewise EM
outperforms other initialization techniques for crowdsourcing and neurosciences
applications, and can guide a full EM to results comparable to those obtained

  Log-Linear Models"	"  We propose a novel molecular computing scheme for statistical inference. We
focus on the much-studied statistical inference problem of computing maximum
likelihood estimators for log-linear models. Our scheme takes log-linear models
to reaction systems, and the observed data to initial conditions, so that the
corresponding equilibrium of each reaction system encodes the corresponding
maximum likelihood estimator. The main idea is to exploit the coincidence
between thermodynamic entropy and statistical entropy. We map a Maximum Entropy
characterization of the maximum likelihood estimator onto a Maximum Entropy
characterization of the equilibrium concentrations for the reaction system.
This allows for an efficient encoding of the problem, and reveals that reaction
networks are superbly suited to statistical inference tasks. Such a scheme may
also provide a template to understanding how in vivo biochemical signaling
pathways integrate extensive information about their environment and history.

  precision responses"	"  Single cells often generate precise responses by involving dissipative
out-of-thermodynamic equilibrium processes in signaling networks. The available
free energy to fuel these processes could become limited depending on the
metabolic state of an individual cell. How does limiting dissipation affect the
kinetics of high precision responses in single cells? I address this question
in the context of a kinetic proofreading scheme used in a simple model of early
time T cell signaling. I show using exact analytical calculations and numerical
simulations that limiting dissipation qualitatively changes the kinetics in
single cells marked by emergence of slow kinetics, large cell-to-cell
variations of copy numbers, temporally correlated stochastic events (dynamic
facilitation), and, ergodicity breaking. Thus, constraints in energy
dissipation, in addition to negatively affecting ligand discrimination in T
cells, can create a fundamental difficulty in interpreting single cell kinetics
from cell population level results.

  Complex Behaviors of Walking Robots"	"  Walking animals, like stick insects, cockroaches or ants, demonstrate a
fascinating range of locomotive abilities and complex behaviors. The locomotive
behaviors can consist of a variety of walking patterns along with adaptation
that allow the animals to deal with changes in environmental conditions, like
uneven terrains, gaps, obstacles etc. Biological study has revealed that such
complex behaviors are a result of a combination of biome- chanics and neural
mechanism thus representing the true nature of embodied interactions. While the
biomechanics helps maintain flexibility and sustain a variety of movements, the
neural mechanisms generate movements while making appropriate predictions
crucial for achieving adaptation. Such predictions or planning ahead can be
achieved by way of in- ternal models that are grounded in the overall behavior
of the animal. Inspired by these findings, we present here, an artificial
bio-inspired walking system which effectively com- bines biomechanics (in terms
of the body and leg structures) with the underlying neural mechanisms. The
neural mechanisms consist of 1) central pattern generator based control for
generating basic rhythmic patterns and coordinated movements, 2) distributed
(at each leg) recurrent neural network based adaptive forward models with
efference copies as internal models for sensory predictions and instantaneous
state estimations, and 3) searching and elevation control for adapting the
movement of an individual leg to deal with different environmental conditions.
Using simulations we show that this bio-inspired approach with adaptive
internal models allows the walking robot to perform complex loco- motive
behaviors as observed in insects, including walking on undulated terrains,
crossing large gaps as well as climbing over high obstacles...

(HRIR) cues for a spatial auditory brain-computer interface (saBCI) speller
paradigm. We present a comparison with the conventional virtual sound
headphone-based spatial auditory modality. We propose and optimize the three

with encouragingly good and stable P300 responses in online BCI experiments.
Our case study indicated that users could perceive elevation in the saBCI

  Intracortical Implants"	"  Current microelectrodes designed to record chronic neural activity suffer
from recording instabilities due to the modulus mismatch between the electrode
materials and the brain. We sought to address this by microfabricating a novel
flexible neural probe. Our probe was fabricated from parylene-C with a WTi
metal, using contact photolithography and reactive ion etching, with three
design features to address this modulus mismatch: a sinusoidal shaft, a rounded
tip and a polyimide anchoring ball. The anchor restricts movement of the
electrode recording sites and the shaft accommodates the brain motion. We
successfully patterned thick metal and parylene-C layers, with a reliable
device release process leading to high functional yield. This novel reliably
microfabricated probe can record stable neural activity for up to two years
without delamination, surpassing the current state-of-the-art intracortical
probes. This challenges recent concerns that have been raised over the
long-term reliability of chronic implants when Parylene-C is used as an
insulator, for both research and human applications. The microfabrication and
design considerations provided in this manuscript may aid in the future
development of flexible devices for biomedical applications.

1506.05171	q-bio	q-bio.QM cs.SY	On the Origins and Control of Community Types in the Human Microbiome	"  Microbiome-based stratification of healthy individuals into compositional
categories, referred to as ""community types"", holds promise for drastically
improving personalized medicine. Despite this potential, the existence of
community types and the degree of their distinctness have been highly debated.
Here we adopted a dynamic systems approach and found that heterogeneity in the
interspecific interactions or the presence of strongly interacting species is
sufficient to explain community types, independent of the topology of the
underlying ecological network. By controlling the presence or absence of these
strongly interacting species we can steer the microbial ecosystem to any
desired community type. This open-loop control strategy still holds even when
the community types are not distinct but appear as dense regions within a
continuous gradient. This finding can be used to develop viable therapeutic
strategies for shifting the microbial composition to a healthy configuration

biomarkers based on the epigenetic pattern DNA methylation. Epigenetic
processes such as DNA methylation reflect environmental risk factors, and are
increasingly recognised for their fundamental role in diseases such as cancer.
DNA methylation is a gene-regulatory pattern, and hence provides a means by
which to assess genomic regulatory interactions. Network models are a natural
way to represent and analyse groups of such interactions. The utility of
network models also increases as the quantity of data and number of variables
increase, making them increasingly relevant to large-scale genomic studies. We
propose methodology to infer prognostic genomic networks from a DNA
methylation-based measure of genomic interaction and association. We then show
how to identify prognostic biomarkers from such networks, which we term
`network community oncomarkers'. We illustrate the power of our proposed
methodology in the context of a large publicly available breast cancer dataset.

1506.05828	q-bio	nlin.AO q-bio.NC	Mathematical frameworks for oscillatory network dynamics in neuroscience	"  The tools of weakly coupled phase oscillator theory have had a profound
impact on the neuroscience community, providing insight into a variety of
network behaviours ranging from central pattern generation to synchronisation,
as well as predicting novel network states such as chimeras. However, there are
many instances when this theory is expected to break down, say in the presence
of strong coupling, or must be carefully interpreted, as in the presence of
stochastic forcing. There are also surprises in the dynamical complexity of the
attractors that can robustly appear - for example, heteroclinic network
attractors. In this review we present a set of mathematical tools that are
suitable for addressing the dynamics of oscillatory neural networks, broadening
from a standard phase oscillator perspective to provide a practical framework
for further successful applications of mathematics to understanding network
dynamics in neuroscience.

1506.05905	q-bio	cs.CE q-bio.MN quant-ph	Quantum IsoRank: Efficient Alignment of Multiple PPI Networks	"  Comparative analyses of protein-protein interaction networks play important
roles in the understanding of biological processes. However, the growing
enormity of available data on the networks becomes a computational challenge
for the conventional alignment algorithms. Quantum algorithms generally provide
greater efficiency over their classical counterparts in solving various
problems.
  One of such algorithms is the quantum phase estimation algorithm which
generates the principal eigenvector of a stochastic matrix with probability
one.
  Using the quantum phase estimation algorithm, we introduce a quantum
computing approach for the alignment of protein-protein interaction networks by
following the classical algorithm IsoRank which uses the principal eigenvector
of the stochastic matrix representing the Kronecker product of the normalized
adjacency matrices of networks for the pairwise alignment. We also present a
greedy quantum measurement scheme to efficiently procure the alignment from the
output state of the phase estimation algorithm where the eigenvector is encoded
as the amplitudes of this state. The complexity of the quantum approach
outperforms the classical running time.

1506.06446	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Computational Performance and Statistical Accuracy of *BEAST and
  Comparisons with Other Methods"	"  Under the multispecies coalescent model of molecular evolution, gene trees
have independent evolutionary histories within a shared species tree. In
comparison, supermatrix concatenation methods assume that gene trees share a
single common genealogical history, thereby equating gene coalescence with
species divergence. The multispecies coalescent is supported by previous
studies which found that its predicted distributions fit empirical data, and
that concatenation is not a consistent estimator of the species tree. *BEAST, a
fully Bayesian implementation of the multispecies coalescent, is popular but
computationally intensive, so the increasing size of phylogenetic data sets is
both a computational challenge and an opportunity for better systematics. Using
simulation studies, we characterize the scaling behaviour of *BEAST, and enable
quantitative prediction of the impact increasing the number of loci has on both
computational performance and statistical accuracy. Follow up simulations over
a wide range of parameters show that the statistical performance of *BEAST
relative to concatenation improves both as branch length is reduced and as the
number of loci is increased. Finally, using simulations based on estimated
parameters from two phylogenomic data sets, we compare the performance of a
range of species tree and concatenation methods to show that using *BEAST with
tens of loci can be preferable to using concatenation with thousands of loci.
Our results provide insight into the practicalities of Bayesian species tree
estimation, the number of loci required to obtain a given level of accuracy and
the situations in which supermatrix or summary methods will be outperformed by
the fully Bayesian multispecies coalescent.

representation upon the past context. We study this measure both numerically
and theoretically using the mean-field theory for random neural networks,
showing the existence of an optimal level of synaptic weights heterogeneity. We
further investigate the influence of the network topology, in particular the
symmetry of reciprocal synaptic connections, on this measure of context
dependence, revealing the importance of considering the interplay between
non-linearities and connectivity structure.

1506.06662	q-bio	q-bio.BM q-bio.QM	"Fast assessment of structural models of ion channels based on their
  predicted current-voltage characteristics"	"  Computational prediction of protein structures is a difficult task, which
involves fast and accurate evaluation of candidate model structures. We propose
to enhance single model quality assessment with a functionality evaluation
phase for proteins whose quantitative functional characteristics are known. In
particular, this idea can be applied to evaluation of structural models of ion
channels, whose main function - conducting ions - can be quantitatively
measured with the patch-clamp technique providing the current-voltage
characteristics. The study was performed on a set of KcsA channel models
obtained from complete and incomplete contact maps. A fast continuous
electrodiffusion model was used for calculating the current-voltage
characteristics of structural models. We found that the computed charge
selectivity and total current were sensitive to structural and electrostatic
quality of models. In practical terms, we show that evaluating predicted
conductance values is an appropriate method to eliminate modes with an occluded
pore or with multiple erroneously created pores. Moreover, filtering models on
the basis of their predicted charge selectivity results in a substantial
enrichment of the candidate set in highly accurate models. In addition to being
a proof of the concept, our function-oriented single model quality assessment
tool can be directly applied for evaluation of structural models of
strongly-selective protein channels. Finally, our work raises an important
question whether a computational validation of functionality should not be
included in the evaluation process of structural models, whenever possible.

we generalize common features of the SIF effect and suggest possible future

1506.06925	q-bio	q-bio.MN physics.bio-ph	Intrinsic limits to gene regulation by global crosstalk	"  Gene regulation relies on the specificity of transcription factor (TF) - DNA
interactions. In equilibrium, limited specificity may lead to crosstalk: a
regulatory state in which a gene is either incorrectly activated due to
noncognate TF-DNA interactions or remains erroneously inactive. We present a
tractable biophysical model of global crosstalk, where many genes are
simultaneously regulated by many TFs. We show that in the simplest regulatory
scenario, a lower bound on crosstalk severity can be analytically derived
solely from the number of (co)regulated genes and a suitable parameter that
describes binding site similarity. Estimates show that crosstalk could present
a significant challenge for organisms with low-specificity TFs, such as
metazoans, unless they use appropriate regulation schemes. Strong cooperativity
substantially decreases crosstalk, while joint regulation by activators and
repressors, surprisingly, does not; moreover, certain microscopic details about
promoter architecture emerge as globally important determinants of crosstalk
strength. Our results suggest that crosstalk imposes a new type of global
constraint on the functioning and evolution of regulatory networks, which is
qualitatively distinct from the known constraints acting at the level of
individual gene regulatory elements.

1506.06971	q-bio	q-bio.PE nlin.AO nlin.CD	Bounds on transient instability for complex ecosystems	"  Stability is a desirable property of complex ecosystems. If a community of
interacting species is at a stable equilibrium point then it is able to
withstand small perturbations to component species' abundances without
suffering adverse effects. In ecology, the Jacobian matrix evaluated at an
equilibrium point is known as the community matrix, which describes the
population dynamics of interacting species. A system's asymptotic short- and
long-term behaviour can be determined from eigenvalues derived from the
community matrix. Here we use results from the theory of pseudospectra to
describe intermediate, transient dynamics. We first recover the established
result that the transition from stable to unstable dynamics includes a region
of `transient instability', where the effect of a small perturbation to
species' abundances---to the population vector---is amplified before ultimately
decaying. Then we show that the shift from stability to transient instability
can be affected by uncertainty in, or small changes to, entries in the
community matrix, and determine lower and upper bounds to the maximum amplitude
of perturbations to the population vector. Of five different types of community
matrix, we find that amplification is least severe when predator-prey
interactions dominate. This analysis is relevant to other systems whose
dynamics can be expressed in terms of the Jacobian matrix. Our results will
lead to improved understanding of how multiple perturbations to a complex
system may irrecoverably break stability.

evolutionary models. However, simulation is difficult because there is no known
closed-form formula for its transition function. In this article we demonstrate
that it is in fact possible to simulate exactly from a broad class of
Wright-Fisher diffusion processes and their bridges. For those diffusions
corresponding to reversible, neutral evolution, our key idea is to exploit an
eigenfunction expansion of the transition function; this approach even applies
to its infinite-dimensional analogue, the Fleming-Viot process. We then develop
an exact rejection algorithm for processes with more general drift functions,
including those modelling natural selection, using ideas from retrospective
simulation. Our approach also yields methods for exact simulation of the moment
dual of the Wright-Fisher diffusion, the ancestral process of an infinite-leaf
Kingman coalescent tree. We believe our new perspective on diffusion simulation
holds promise for other models admitting a transition eigenfunction expansion.

durotaxis as modes of motility. It is able to theoretically explain all
relevant experimental observations, in particular, the high efficiency of

"
1506.07472	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Asymmetric evolutionary games	"  Evolutionary game theory is a powerful framework for studying evolution in
populations of interacting individuals. A common assumption in evolutionary
game theory is that interactions are symmetric, which means that the players
are distinguished by only their strategies. In nature, however, the microscopic
interactions between players are nearly always asymmetric due to environmental
effects, differing baseline characteristics, and other possible sources of
heterogeneity. To model these phenomena, we introduce into evolutionary game
theory two broad classes of asymmetric interactions: ecological and genotypic.
Ecological asymmetry results from variation in the environments of the players,
while genotypic asymmetry is a consequence of the players having differing
baseline genotypes. We develop a theory of these forms of asymmetry for games
in structured populations and use the classical social dilemmas, the Prisoner's
Dilemma and the Snowdrift Game, for illustrations. Interestingly, asymmetric
games reveal essential differences between models of genetic evolution based on
reproduction and models of cultural evolution based on imitation that are not
apparent in symmetric games.

cancer mutations. In short, their formulation asks to split each row of a
binary matrix so that the resulting matrix corresponds to a perfect phylogeny

NP-hardness proof of it. However, we show that the problem is indeed NP-hard,
by providing a different proof. We also prove NP-completeness of a variant of
this problem proposed in the same paper. On the positive side, we propose an
efficient (though not necessarily optimal) heuristic algorithm based on
coloring co-comparability graphs, and a polynomial time algorithm for solving
the problem optimally on matrix instances in which no column is contained in
both columns of a pair of conflicting columns. Implementations of these

1506.07951	q-bio	q-bio.BM cond-mat.soft physics.bio-ph	The role of correlation and solvation in ion interactions with B-DNA	"  The ionic atmospheres around nucleic acids play important roles in biological
function. Large-scale explicit solvent simulations coupled to experimental
assays such as anomalous small-angle X-ray scattering (ASAXS) can provide
important insights into the structure and energetics of such atmospheres but
are time- and resource-intensive. In this paper, we use classical density
functional theory (cDFT) to explore the balance between ion-DNA, ion-water, and
ion-ion interactions in ionic atmospheres of RbCl, SrCl$_2$, and CoHexCl$_3$
(cobalt hexammine chloride) around a B-form DNA molecule. The accuracy of the
cDFT calculations was assessed by comparison between simulated and experimental
ASAXS curves, demonstrating that an accurate model should take into account
ion-ion correlation and ion hydration forces, DNA topology, and the discrete
distribution of charges on DNA strands. As expected, these calculations
revealed significant differences between monovalent, divalent, and trivalent
cation distributions around DNA. About half of the DNA-bound Rb$^+$ ions
penetrate into the minor groove of the DNA and half adsorb on the DNA strands.
The fraction of cations in the minor groove decreases for the larger Sr$^{2+}$
ions and becomes zero for CoHex$^{3+}$ ions, which all adsorb on the DNA
strands. The distribution of CoHex$^{3+}$ ions is mainly determined by Coulomb
and steric interactions, while ion-correlation forces play a central role in
the monovalent Rb$^+$ distribution and a combination of ion-correlation and
hydration forces affect the Sr$^{2+}$ distribution around DNA.

1506.07976	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Multi Loci Phylogenetic Analysis with Gene Tree Clustering	"  Summary: Both theory and empirical evidence indicate that phylogenies (trees)
of different genes (loci) do not display precisely matched topologies. This
phylogenetic incongruence is attributed to the reticulated evolutionary history
of most species due to meiotic sexual recombination in eukaryotes, or
horizontal transfers of genetic materials in prokaryotes. Nonetheless, most
genes do display topologically related phylogenies; this implies they form
cohesive subsets (clusters). In this work, we compare popular clustering
methods, and show how the performance of the normalized cut framework is
efficient and statistically accurate when obtaining clusters on the set of gene
trees based on the geodesic distance between them over the
Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann (BHV) tree space. We proceed to present a computational
study on the performance of different clustering methods with and without
preprocessing under different distance metrics and using a series of dimension
reduction techniques. Results: First, we show using simulated data that indeed
the Ncut framework accurately clusters the set of gene trees given a species
tree under the coalescent process. We then depict the success of our framework
by comparing its performance to other clustering techniques, including k-means
and hierarchical clustering. The main computational results can be summarized
to the stellar performance of the Ncut framework even without dimension
reduction, the similar performance portrayed by k-means and Ncut under most
dimension reduction schemes, the utter failure of hierarchical clustering to
accurately capture clusters, as well as the significantly better performance of
the NJp method, as compared to MLE.

  Aggregates"	"  Bacterial biofilms are usually assumed to originate from individual cells
deposited on a surface. However, many biofilm-forming bacteria tend to
aggregate in the planktonic phase so that it is possible that many natural and
infectious biofilms originate wholly or partially from pre-formed cell
aggregates. Here, we use agent-based computer simulations to investigate the
role of pre-formed aggregates in biofilm development. Focusing on the initial
shape the aggregate forms on the surface, we find that the degree of spreading
of an aggregate on a surface can play an important role in determining its
eventual fate during biofilm development. Specifically, initially spread
aggregates perform better when competition with surrounding unaggregated
bacterial cells is low, while initially rounded aggregates perform better when
competition with surrounding unaggregated cells is high. These contrasting
outcomes are governed by a trade-off between aggregate surface area and height.
Our results provide new insight into biofilm formation and development, and
reveal new factors that may be at play in the social evolution of biofilm
communities.

1506.08218	q-bio	math.PR q-bio.NC	Stochastic Unrelatedness, Couplings, and Contextuality	"  R. Duncan Luce once mentioned in a conversation that he did not consider
Kolmogorov's probability theory well-constructed because it treats stochastic
independence as a ""numerical accident,"" while it should be treated as a
fundamental relation, more basic than the assignment of numerical
probabilities. I argue here that stochastic independence is indeed a ""numerical
accident,"" a special form of stochastic dependence between random variables
(most broadly defined). The idea that it is fundamental may owe its
attractiveness to the confusion of stochastic independence with stochastic
unrelatedness, the situation when two or more random variables have no joint
distribution, ""have nothing to do with each other."" Kolmogorov's probability
theory cannot be consistently constructed without allowing for stochastic
unrelatedness, in fact making it a default situation: any two random variables
recorded under mutually incompatible conditions are stochastically unrelated.
However, stochastically unrelated random variables can always be
probabilistically coupled, i.e., imposed a joint distribution upon, and this
generally can be done in an infinity of ways, independent coupling being merely
one of them. The notions of stochastic unrelatedness and all possible couplings
play a central role in the foundation of probability theory and, especially, in
the theory of probabilistic contextuality.

  Dynamics of Crossing a Doorway to the Untrodden"	"  Insects exhibit remarkable cognitive skills in the field and several
cognitive abilities have been demonstrated in Drosophila in the laboratory. By
devising an ethologically relevant experimental setup that also allows
comparison of behavior across remote taxonomic groups we sought to reduce the
gap between the field and the laboratory, and reveal as yet undiscovered
ethological phenomena within a wider phylogenetic perspective. We tracked
individual flies that eclosed in a small (45mm) arena containing a piece of
fruit, connected to a larger (130mm) arena by a wide (5mm) doorway. Using this
setup we show that the widely open doorway initially functions as a barrier:
the likelihood of entering the large arena increases gradually, requiring
repeated approaches to the doorway, and even after entering the flies
immediately return. Gradually the flies acquire the option to avoid returning,
spending more relative time and performing relatively longer excursions in the
large arena. The entire process may take up three successive days. This
behavior constitutes coping with space neophobia, the avoidance of untrodden
space. It appears to be the same as the neophobic doorway-crossing reported in
mouse models of anxiety. In both mice and flies the moment-to-moment
developmental dynamics of transition between trodden and untrodden terrain
appear to be the same, and in mice it is taken to imply memory and, therefore,
cognition. Recent claims have been made for a deep homology between the
arthropod central complex and the vertebrate basal ganglia, two structures
involved in navigation. The shared dynamics of space occupancy in flies and
mice might indicate the existence of cognitive exploration also in the flies or
else a convergent structure exhibiting the same developmental dynamics.

with excitatory and inhibitory populations, in terms of local and global
bifurcations of the neural activity. Our approach is analytically tractable in
many respects, and sheds new light on the finite-size effects of the system. In
particular, we focus on the formation of multiple branching solutions of the
neural equations through spontaneous symmetry-breaking, since this phenomenon
increases considerably the complexity of the dynamical behavior of the network.
For these reasons, branching points may reveal important mechanisms through
which neurons interact and process information, which are not accounted for by
the mean-field approximation.

1507.00366	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Linking age, survival and transit time distributions	"  Although the concepts of age, survival and transit time have been widely used
in many fields, including population dynamics, chemical engineering, and
hydrology, a comprehensive mathematical framework is still missing. Here we
discuss several relationships among these quantities by starting from the
evolution equation for the joint distribution of age and survival, from which
the equations for age and survival time readily follow. It also becomes
apparent how the statistical dependence between age and survival is directly
related to either the age-dependence of the loss function or the survival-time
dependence of the input function. The solution of the joint distribution
equation also allows us to obtain the relationships between the age at exit (or
death) and the survival time at input (or birth), as well as to stress the
symmetries of the various distributions under time reversal. The transit time
is then obtained as a sum of the age and survival time, and its properties are
discussed along with the general relationships between their mean values. The
special case of steady state case is analyzed in detail. Some examples,
inspired by hydrologic applications, are presented to illustrate the theory
with the specific results.

1507.00368	q-bio	q-bio.NC q-bio.QM	Dynamic similarity promotes interpersonal coordination in joint-action	"  Human movement has been studied for decades and dynamic laws of motion that
are common to all humans have been derived. Yet, every individual moves
differently from everyone else (faster/slower, harder/smoother etc). We propose
here an index of such variability, namely an individual motor signature (IMS)
able to capture the subtle differences in the way each of us moves. We show
that the IMS of a person is time-invariant and that it significantly differs
from those of other individuals. This allows us to quantify the dynamic
similarity, a measure of rapport between dynamics of different individuals'
movements, and demonstrate that it facilitates coordination during interaction.
We use our measure to confirm a key prediction of the theory of similarity that
coordination between two individuals performing a joint-action task is higher
if their motions share similar dynamic features. Furthermore, we use a virtual
avatar driven by an interactive cognitive architecture based on feedback
control theory to explore the effects of different kinematic features of the
avatar motion on the coordination with human players.

1507.00466	q-bio	q-bio.QM physics.bio-ph physics.optics	The Theory of Diffraction Tomography	"  Tomography is the three-dimensional reconstruction of an object from images
taken at different angles. The term classical tomography is used, when the
imaging beam travels in straight lines through the object. This assumption is
valid for light with short wavelengths, for example in x-ray tomography. For
classical tomography, a commonly used reconstruction method is the filtered
back-projection algorithm which yields fast and stable object reconstructions.
In the context of single-cell imaging, the back-projection algorithm has been
used to investigate the cell structure or to quantify the refractive index
distribution within single cells using light from the visible spectrum.
Nevertheless, these approaches, commonly summarized as optical projection
tomography, do not take into account diffraction. Diffraction tomography with
the Rytov approximation resolves this issue. The explicit incorporation of the
wave nature of light results in an enhanced reconstruction of the object's
refractive index distribution. Here, we present a full literature review of
diffraction tomography. We derive the theory starting from the wave equation
and discuss its validity with the focus on applications for refractive index
tomography. Furthermore, we derive the back-propagation algorithm, the
diffraction-tomographic pendant to the back-projection algorithm, and describe
its implementation in three dimensions. Finally, we showcase the application of
the back-propagation algorithm to computer-generated scattering data. This
review unifies the different notations in literature and gives a detailed
description of the back-propagation algorithm, serving as a reliable basis for
future work in the field of diffraction tomography.

1507.00511	q-bio	physics.bio-ph cond-mat.soft q-bio.CB	Determining physical properties of the cell cortex	"  Actin and myosin assemble into a thin layer of a highly dynamic network
underneath the membrane of eukaryotic cells. This network generates the forces
that drive cell and tissue-scale morphogenetic processes. The effective
material properties of this active network determine large-scale deformations
and other morphogenetic events. For example,the characteristic time of stress
relaxation (the Maxwell time)in the actomyosin sets the time scale of
large-scale deformation of the cortex. Similarly, the characteristic length of
stress propagation (the hydrodynamic length) sets the length scale of slow
deformations, and a large hydrodynamic length is a prerequisite for long-ranged
cortical flows. Here we introduce a method to determine physical parameters of
the actomyosin cortical layer (in vivo). For this we investigate the relaxation
dynamics of the cortex in response to laser ablation in the one-cell-stage {\it
C. elegans} embryo and in the gastrulating zebrafish embryo. These responses
can be interpreted using a coarse grained physical description of the cortex in
terms of a two dimensional thin film of an active viscoelastic gel. To
determine the Maxwell time, the hydrodynamic length and the ratio of active
stress and per-area friction, we evaluated the response to laser ablation in
two different ways: by quantifying flow and density fields as a function of
space and time, and by determining the time evolution of the shape of the
ablated region. Importantly, both methods provide best fit physical parameters
that are in close agreement with each other and that are similar to previous
estimates in the two systems. We provide an accurate and robust means for
measuring physical parameters of the actomyosin cortical layer.It can be useful
for investigations of actomyosin mechanics at the cellular-scale, but also for
providing insights in the active mechanics processes that govern tissue-scale
morphogenesis.

  repertoires"	"  The adaptive immune system relies on the diversity of receptors expressed on
the surface of B and T-cells to protect the organism from a vast amount of
pathogenic threats. The proliferation and degradation dynamics of different
cell types (B cells, T cells, naive, memory) is governed by a variety of
antigenic and environmental signals, yet the observed clone sizes follow a
universal power law distribution. Guided by this reproducibility we propose
effective models of somatic evolution where cell fate depends on an effective
fitness. This fitness is determined by growth factors acting either on clones
of cells with the same receptor responding to specific antigens, or directly on
single cells with no regards for clones. We identify fluctuations in the
fitness acting specifically on clones as the essential ingredient leading to
the observed distributions. Combining our models with experiments we
characterize the scale of fluctuations in antigenic environments and we provide
tools to identify the relevant growth signals in different tissues and
organisms. Our results generalize to any evolving population in a fluctuating
environment.

1507.00947	q-bio	q-bio.QM	Cancer risk is not (just) bad luck	"  Tomasetti and Vogelstein recently proposed that the majority of variation in
cancer risk among tissues is due to ""bad luck,"" that is, random mutations
arising during DNA replication in normal noncancerous stem cells. They
generalize this finding to cancer overall, claiming that ""the stochastic
effects of DNA replication appear to be the major contributor to cancer in
humans."" We show that this conclusion results from a logical fallacy based on
ignoring the influence of population heterogeneity in correlations exhibited at
the level of the whole population. Because environmental and genetic factors
cannot explain the huge differences in cancer rates between different organs,
it is wrong to conclude that these factors play a minor role in cancer rates.
In contrast, we show that one can indeed measure huge differences in cancer
rates between different organs and, at the same time, observe a strong effect
of environmental and genetic factors in cancer rates.

  spot"	"  Filling-in at the blind-spot is a perceptual phenomenon in which the visual
system fills the informational void, which arises due to the absence of retinal
input corresponding to the optic disc, with surrounding visual attributes.
Though there are enough evidence to conclude that some kind of neural
computation is involved in filling-in at the blind spot especially in the early
visual cortex, the knowledge of the actual computational mechanism is far from
complete. We have investigated the bar experiments and the associated
filling-in phenomenon in the light of the hierarchical predictive coding
framework, where the blind-spot was represented by the absence of early
feed-forward connection. We recorded the responses of predictive estimator
neurons at the blind-spot region in the V1 area of our three level (LGN-V1-V2)
model network. These responses are in agreement with the results of earlier
physiological studies and using the generative model we also showed that these
response profiles indeed represent the filling-in completion. These demonstrate
that predictive coding framework could account for the filling-in phenomena
observed in several psychophysical and physiological experiments involving bar
stimuli. These results suggest that the filling-in could naturally arise from
the computational principle of hierarchical predictive coding (HPC) of natural
images.

  in complex media"	"  High-throughput experimental techniques and bioinformatics tools make it
possible to obtain reconstructions of the metabolism of microbial species.
Combined with mathematical frameworks such as flux balance analysis, which
assumes that nutrients are used so as to maximize growth, these reconstructions
enable us to predict microbial growth.
  Although such predictions are generally accurate, these approaches do not
give insights on how different nutrients are used to produce growth, and thus
are difficult to generalize to new media or to different organisms.
  Here, we propose a systems-level phenomenological model of metabolism
inspired by the virial expansion. Our model predicts biomass production given
the nutrient uptakes and a reduced set of parameters, which can be easily
determined experimentally. To validate our model, we test it against in silico
simulations and experimental measurements of growth, and find good agreement.
From a biological point of view, our model uncovers the impact that individual
nutrients and the synergistic interaction between nutrient pairs have on
growth, and suggests that we can understand the growth maximization principle
as the optimization of nutrient synergies.

Proteins) method that uses millisecond imaging with convolution analysis,
automated image segmentation and super-resolution localization microscopy to
generate robust estimates for protein concentration in different compartments
of single living cells, validated using realistic simulations of complex
multiple compartment cell types. We demonstrates its utility experimentally on
model Escherichia coli bacteria and Saccharomyces cerevisiae budding yeast
cells, and use it to address the biological question of how signals are
transduced in cells. Cells in all domains of life dynamically sense their
environment through signal transduction mechanisms, many involving gene
regulation. The glucose sensing mechanism of S. cerevisiae is a model system
for studying gene regulatory signal transduction. It uses the multi-copy
expression inhibitor of the GAL gene family, Mig1, to repress unwanted genes in
the presence of elevated extracellular glucose concentrations. We fluorescently
labelled Mig1 molecules with green fluorescent protein (GFP) via chromosomal
integration at physiological expression levels in living S. cerevisiae cells,
in addition to the RNA polymerase protein Nrd1 with the fluorescent protein
reporter mCherry. Using CoPro we make quantitative estimates of Mig1 and Nrd1
protein concentrations in the cytoplasm and nucleus compartments on a
cell-by-cell basis under physiological conditions. These estimates indicate a
4-fold shift towards higher values in concentration of diffusive Mig1 in the
nucleus if the external glucose concentration is raised, whereas equivalent
levels in the cytoplasm shift to smaller values with a relative change an order
of magnitude smaller. This compares with Nrd1 which is not involved directly in
glucose sensing, which is almost exclusively localized in the nucleus under

1507.02562	q-bio	q-bio.MN	"Extending the dynamic range of transcription factor action by
  translational regulation"	"  A crucial step in the regulation of gene expression is binding of
transcription factor (TF) proteins to regulatory sites along the DNA. But
transcription factors act at nanomolar concentrations, and noise due to random
arrival of these molecules at their binding sites can severely limit the
precision of regulation. Recent work on the optimization of information flow
through regulatory networks indicates that the lower end of the dynamic range
of concentrations is simply inaccessible, overwhelmed by the impact of this
noise. Motivated by the behavior of homeodomain proteins, such as the maternal
morphogen Bicoid in the fruit fly embryo, we suggest a scheme in which
transcription factors also act as indirect translational regulators, binding to
the mRNA of other transcription factors. Intuitively, each mRNA molecule acts
as an independent sensor of the TF concentration, and averaging over these
multiple sensors reduces the noise. We analyze information flow through this
new scheme and identify conditions under which it outperforms direct
transcriptional regulation. Our results suggest that the dual role of
homeodomain proteins is not just a historical accident, but a solution to a
crucial physics problem in the regulation of gene expression.

1507.02940	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Optimal Vaccination Strategies and Rational Behaviour in Seasonal
  Epidemics"	"  We consider a SIR model with temporary immunity and time dependent
transmission rate. We assume time dependent vaccination which confers the same
immunity as natural infection. We study two types of vaccination strategies: i)
optimal vaccination, in the sense that it minimizes the effort of vaccination
in the set of vaccination strategies for which, for any sufficiently small
perturbation of the disease free state, the number of infectious individuals is
monotonically decreasing; ii) Nash-equilibria strategies where all individuals
simultaneously minimize the joint risk of vaccination versus the risk of the
disease. The former case corresponds to an optimal solution for mandatory
vaccinations, while the second correspond to the equilibrium to be expected if
vaccination is fully voluntary. We are able to show the existence of both an
optimal and Nash strategies in a general setting. In general, these strategies
will not be functions but Radon measures. For specific forms of the
transmission rate, we provide explicit formulas for the optimal and the Nash
vaccination strategies.

  Large number of units"	"  We study the activation process in large assemblies of type II excitable
units whose dynamics is influenced by two independent noise terms. The
mean-field approach is applied to explicitly demonstrate that the assembly of
excitable units can itself exhibit macroscopic excitable behavior. In order to
facilitate the comparison between the excitable dynamics of a single unit and
an assembly, we introduce three distinct formulations of the assembly
activation event. Each formulation treats different aspects of the relevant
phenomena, including the threshold-like behavior and the role of coherence of
individual spikes. Statistical properties of the assembly activation process,
such as the mean time-to-first pulse and the associated coefficient of
variation, are found to be qualitatively analogous for all three formulations,
as well as to resemble the results for a single unit. These analogies are shown
to derive from the fact that global variables undergo a stochastic bifurcation
from the stochastically stable fixed point to continuous oscillations. Local
activation processes are analyzed in the light of the competition between the
noise-led and the relaxation-driven dynamics. We also briefly report on a
system-size anti-resonant effect displayed by the mean time-to-first pulse.

process of a single and two interacting excitable units, which are
mathematically described by the Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations. We determine the
most probable activation paths around which the corresponding stochastic
trajectories are clustered. The key point lies in introducing appropriate
boundary conditions that are relevant for a class II excitable unit, which can
be immediately generalized also to scenarios involving two coupled units. We
analyze the effects of the two noise sources on the statistical features of the
activation process, in particular demonstrating how these are modified due to
the linear/nonlinear form of interactions. Universal properties of the
activation process are qualitatively discussed in the light of a stochastic
bifurcation that underlies the transition from a stochastically stable fixed
point to continuous oscillations.

introduced with the Michaelis-Menten dynamics and the intercellular exchange of
substance. The influence of TNTs are considered as a functional perturbation of
the main communication and treated as the matrix nearness problems. We analyze
communication integrity in terms of the \emph{pseudospectra} of the exchange,
to find the \emph{distance to instability}. The threshold of TNTs influence is

1507.03511	q-bio	q-bio.PE cond-mat.stat-mech	Greedy adaptive walks on a correlated fitness landscape	"  We study adaptation of a haploid asexual population on a fitness landscape
defined over binary genotype sequences of length $L$. We consider greedy
adaptive walks in which the population moves to the fittest among all single
mutant neighbors of the current genotype until a local fitness maximum is
reached. The landscape is of the rough mount Fuji type, which means that the
fitness value assigned to a sequence is the sum of a random and a deterministic
component. The random components are independent and identically distributed
random variables, and the deterministic component varies linearly with the
distance to a reference sequence. The deterministic fitness gradient $c$ is a
parameter that interpolates between the limits of an uncorrelated random
landscape ($c = 0$) and an effectively additive landscape ($c \to \infty$).
When the random fitness component is chosen from the Gumbel distribution,
explicit expressions for the distribution of the number of steps taken by the
greedy walk are obtained, and it is shown that the walk length varies
non-monotonically with the strength of the fitness gradient when the starting
point is sufficiently close to the reference sequence. Asymptotic results for
general distributions of the random fitness component are obtained using
extreme value theory, and it is found that the walk length attains a
non-trivial limit for $L \to \infty$, different from its values for $c=0$ and
$c = \infty$, if $c$ is scaled with $L$ in an appropriate combination.

1507.03647	q-bio	q-bio.PE	The shape of the one-dimensional phylogenetic likelihood function	"  By fixing all parameters in a phylogenetic likelihood model except for one
branch length, one obtains a one-dimensional likelihood function. In this work,
we introduce a mathematical framework to characterize the shapes of such
one-dimensional phylogenetic likelihood functions. This framework is based on
analyses of algebraic structures on the space of all frequency patterns with
respect to a polynomial representation of the likelihood functions. Using this
framework, we provide conditions under which the one-dimensional phylogenetic
likelihood functions are guaranteed to have at most one stationary point, and
this point is the maximum likelihood branch length. These conditions are
satisfied by common simple models including all binary models, the Jukes-Cantor
model and the Felsenstein 1981 model.
  We then prove that for the simplest model that does not satisfy our
conditions, namely, the Kimura 2-parameter model, the one-dimensional
likelihood functions may have multiple stationary points. As a proof of
concept, we construct a non-degenerate example in which the phylogenetic
likelihood function has two local maxima and a local minimum. To construct such
examples, we derive a general method of constructing a tree and sequence data
with a specified frequency pattern at the root. We then extend the result to
prove that the space of all rescaled and translated one-dimensional
phylogenetic likelihood functions under the Kimura 2-parameter model is dense
in the space of all non-negative continuous functions on $[0, \infty)$ with
finite limits. These results indicate that one-dimensional likelihood functions
under advanced evolutionary models can be more complex than it is typically
assumed by phylogenetic inference algorithms; however, these complexities can
be effectively captured by the Kimura 2-parameter model.

environment. These are two different phenomena, and here we investigate the
mechanosensitivity of the IInd kind: how the cell can measure an elastic
modulus at a single point of adhesion -- and how the cell can receive and
interpret the chemical signal released from the sensor. Our model uses the
example of large latent complex of TGFb as a sensor. Stochastic theory gives
the rate of breaking of latent complex, which initiates the signaling feedback
loop after the active TGFb release and leads to a change of cell phenotype
driven by the smooth muscle actin. We investigate the dynamic and steady-state
behaviours of the model, comparing them with experiments. In particular, we
analyse the timescale of approach to the steady state, the stability of the
non-linear dynamical system, and how the steady-state concentrations of the key
markers vary depending on the elasticity of the substrate. We discover a
crossover region for values of substrate elasticity closely corresponding to
that of the fibroblast to myofibroblast transition. We suggest that the cell
could actively vary the parameters of its dynamic feedback loop to `choose' the
position of the transition region and the range of substrate elasticity that it
can detect. In this way, the theory offers the unifying mechanism for a variety
of phenomena, such as the myofibroblast conversion in fibrosis of wounds and
lungs and smooth muscle cell dysfunction in cardiac disease.

representing six evolutionary groups has been derived and analyzed
computationally. A multiple-alignment of the 32 complete genome sequences was
filtered to remove mobile elements and identify the most reliable ~90% of the
aligned length of each of the resulting 496 basic-genome pairs. Patterns of
single-bp mutations (SNPs) in aligned pairs distinguish clonally inherited
regions from regions where either genome has acquired DNA fragments from
diverged genomes by homologous recombination since their last common ancestor.
Such recombinant transfer is pervasive across the basic genome, mostly between
genomes in the same evolutionary group, and generates many unique mosaic
patterns. The six least-diverged genome-pairs have one or two recombinant
transfers of length ~40-115 kbp (and few if any other transfers), each
containing one or more gene clusters known to confer strong selective advantage
in some environments. Moderately diverged genome-pairs (0.4-1% SNPs ) show
mosaic patterns of interspersed clonal and recombinant regions of varying
lengths throughout the basic genome, whereas more highly diverged pairs within
an evolutionary group or pairs between evolutionary groups having >1.3% SNPs
have few clonal matches longer than a few kbp. Many recombinant transfers
appear to incorporate fragments of the entering DNA produced by restriction
systems of the recipient cell. A simple computational model can closely fit the
data. Most recombinant transfers seem likely to be due to generalized
transduction by co-evolving populations of phages, which could efficiently
distribute variability throughout bacterial genomes.

  Algorithms Linking Phylogenies to Transmission Trees"	"  Recent work has attempted to use whole-genome sequence data from pathogens to
reconstruct the transmission trees linking infectors and infectees in
outbreaks. However, transmission trees from one outbreak do not generalize to
future outbreaks. Reconstruction of transmission trees is most useful to public
health if it leads to generalizable scientific insights about disease
transmission. In a survival analysis framework, estimation of transmission
parameters is based on sums or averages over the possible transmission trees. A
phylogeny can increase the precision of these estimates by providing partial
information about who infected whom. The leaves of the phylogeny represent
sampled pathogens, which have known hosts. The interior nodes represent common
ancestors of sampled pathogens, which have unknown hosts. Starting from
assumptions about disease biology and epidemiologic study design, we prove that
there is a one-to-one correspondence between the possible assignments of
interior node hosts and the transmission trees simultaneously consistent with
the phylogeny and the epidemiologic data on person, place, and time. We develop
algorithms to enumerate these transmission trees and show these can be used to
calculate likelihoods that incorporate both epidemiologic data and a phylogeny.
A simulation study confirms that this leads to more efficient estimates of
hazard ratios for infectiousness and baseline hazards of infectious contact,
and we use these methods to analyze data from a foot-and-mouth disease virus
outbreak in the United Kingdom in 2001. These results demonstrate the
importance of data on individuals who escape infection, which is often
overlooked. The combination of survival analysis and algorithms linking
phylogenies to transmission trees is a rigorous but flexible statistical
foundation for molecular infectious disease epidemiology.

  Data-Driven algorithm allows sampling from the posterior distribution"	"  Maximum entropy models provide the least constrained probability
distributions that reproduce statistical properties of experimental datasets.
In this work we characterize the learning dynamics that maximizes the
log-likelihood in the case of large but finite datasets. We first show how the
steepest descent dynamics is not optimal as it is slowed down by the
inhomogeneous curvature of the model parameters space. We then provide a way
for rectifying this space which relies only on dataset properties and does not
require large computational efforts. We conclude by solving the long-time limit
of the parameters dynamics including the randomness generated by the systematic
use of Gibbs sampling. In this stochastic framework, rather than converging to
a fixed point, the dynamics reaches a stationary distribution, which for the
rectified dynamics reproduces the posterior distribution of the parameters.
  We sum up all these insights in a ""rectified"" Data-Driven algorithm that is
fast and by sampling from the parameters posterior avoids both under- and
over-fitting along all the directions of the parameters space. Through the
learning of pairwise Ising models from the recording of a large population of
retina neurons, we show how our algorithm outperforms the steepest descent
method.

a combination of social interactions and environmental cues. We focus on
nonlocal continuum equations, which are often used to model aggregations, and
yet which pose significant analytical and computational challenges. Beginning
with a particular nonlocal aggregation model [Topaz et al., Bull. Math. Bio.,

degenerate Cahn-Hilliard equation. Energy minimizers of this reduced, local
model retain many salient features of those of the nonlocal model, especially
for large populations and away from an aggregation's boundaries. Using the
Cahn-Hilliard model as a testbed, we investigate the degree to which an
external potential modeling food sources can be used to suppress peak
population density, which is essential for controlling locust outbreaks. A
random distribution of food sources tends to increase peak density above its
intrinsic value, while a periodic pattern of food sources can decrease it.

leaf venation phenotypic space. We apply our metric to a database of 186 leaves
and leaflets representing 137 species, predominantly from the Burseraceae
family, revealing diverse topological network traits even within this single
family. We show that topological information significantly improves
identification of leaves from fragments by calculating a ""leaf venation
fingerprint"" from topology and geometry. Further, we present a phenomenological
model suggesting that the topological traits can be explained by noise effects
unique to specimen during development of each leaf which leave their imprint on
the final network. This work opens the path to new quantitative identification
techniques for leaves which go beyond simple geometric traits such as vein
density and is directly applicable to other planar or sub-planar networks such
as blood vessels in the brain.

1507.05050	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Six General Ecosystem Properties are more Intense in Biogeochemical
  Cycling Networks than Food Webs"	"  Network analysis has revealed whole-network properties hypothesized to be
general characteristics of ecosystems including pathway proliferation, and
network non-locality, homogenization, amplification, mutualism, and synergism.
Collectively these properties characterize the impact of indirect interactions
among ecosystem elements. While ecosystem networks generally trace a
thermodynamically conserved unit through the system, there appear to be several
model classes. For example, trophic (TRO) networks are built upon a food web,
usually follow energy or carbon, and are the most abundant in the literature.
Biogeochemical cycling (BGC) networks trace nutrients like nitrogen or
phosphorus and tend to have more recycling than TRO. We tested (1) the
hypothesized generality of the properties in BGC networks and (2) that they
tend to be more strongly expressed in BGC networks than in the TRO networks due
to increased recycling. We compared the properties in 22 BGC and 57 TRO
ecosystem networks from the literature using enaR. The results generally
support the hypotheses. First, five of the properties occurred in all 22 BGC
models, while network mutualism occurred in 86% of the models. Further, these
results were generally robust to a $\pm$50% uncertainty in the model
parameters. Second, the mean network statistics for the six properties were
statistically significantly greater in the BGC models than the TRO models.
These results (1) confirm the general presence of these properties in ecosystem
networks, (2) highlight the significance of model types in determining property
intensities, (3) reinforce the importance of recycling, and (4) provide a set
of indicator benchmarks for future systems comparisons. Further, this work
highlights how indirect effects distributed by network connectivity can
transform whole-ecosystem functioning, and adds to the growing domain of
network ecology.

1507.05249	q-bio	q-bio.NC cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech nlin.CG physics.bio-ph	Diversity improves performance in excitable networks	"  As few real systems comprise indistinguishable units, diversity is a hallmark
of nature. Diversity among interacting units shapes properties of collective
behavior such as synchronization and information transmission. However, the
benefits of diversity on information processing at the edge of a phase
transition, ordinarily assumed to emerge from identical elements, remain
largely unexplored. Analyzing a general model of excitable systems with
heterogeneous excitability, we find that diversity can greatly enhance optimal
performance (by two orders of magnitude) when distinguishing incoming inputs.
Heterogeneous systems possess a subset of specialized elements whose capability
greatly exceeds that of the nonspecialized elements. Nonetheless, the behavior
of the whole network can outperform all subgroups. We also find that diversity
can yield multiple percolation, with performance optimized at tricriticality.
Our results are robust in specific and more realistic neuronal systems
comprising a combination of excitatory and inhibitory units, and indicate that
diversity-induced amplification can be harnessed by neuronal systems for
evaluating stimulus intensities.

1507.05337	q-bio	q-bio.PE cond-mat.stat-mech physics.bio-ph	The geometry of coexistence in large ecosystems	"  The role of species interactions in controlling the interplay between the
stability of an ecosystem and its biodiversity is still not well understood.
The ability of ecological communities to recover after a small perturbation of
the species abundances (local asymptotic stability) has been well studied,
whereas the likelihood of a community to persist when the interactions are
altered (structural stability) has received much less attention. Our goal is to
understand the effects of diversity, interaction strenghts and ecological
network structure on the volume of parameter space leading to feasible
equilibria, i.e., ones in which all populations have positive abundances. We
develop a geometrical framework to study the range of conditions necessary for
feasible coexistence in both mutualistic and consumer-resource systems. Using
analytical and numerical methods, we show that feasibility is determined by
just a handful of quantities describing the interactions, yielding a nontrivial
complexity-feasibility relationship. Analyzing more than 100 empirical
networks, we show that the range of coexistence conditions in mutualistic
systems can be analytically predicted by means of a null model of random
interactions, whereas food webs are characterized by smaller coexistence
domains than those expected by chance. Finally, we characterize the geometric
shape of the feasibility domain, thereby identifying the direction of
perturbations that are more likely to cause extinctions. Interestingly, the
structure of mutualistic interactions leads to very heterogeneous responses to
perturbations, making those systems more fragile than expected by chance.

  elucidated by molecular dynamics simulations"	"  Eukaryotes tune the transcriptional activity of their genome by altering the
nucleosome core particle through multiple chemical processes. In particular,
replacement of the canonical H2A histone with the variants macroH2A and H2A.Z
has been shown to affect DNA accessibility and nucleosome stability; however,
the processes by which this occurs remain poorly understood. Here, we elucidate
the molecular mechanisms of these variants with an extensive molecular dynamics
study of the canonical nucleosome along with three variant-containing
structures: H2A.Z, macroH2A, and an H2A mutant with macroH2A-like L1 loops.
Simulation results show that variant L1 loops play a pivotal role in
stabilizing DNA binding to the octamer through direct interactions, core
structural rearrangements, and altered allosteric networks in the nucleosome.
All variants influence dynamics; however, macroH2A-like systems have the
largest effect on energetics. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis
of allosteric networks in the nucleosome and demonstrate that variants take
advantage of stronger interactions between L1 loops to propagate dynamics
throughout the complex. Furthermore, we show that post-translational
modifications are enriched at key locations in these networks. Taken together,
these results provide new insights into the relationship between the structure,
dynamics, and function of the nucleosome core particle and chromatin fibers,
and how they are influenced by chromatin remodelling factors.

  responses"	"  In this study we present a kernel based convolution model to characterize
neural responses to natural sounds by decoding their time-varying acoustic
features. The model allows to decode natural sounds from high-dimensional
neural recordings, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG), that track timing and
location of human cortical signalling noninvasively across multiple channels.
We used the MEG responses recorded from subjects listening to acoustically
different environmental sounds. By decoding the stimulus frequencies from the
responses, our model was able to accurately distinguish between two different
sounds that it had never encountered before with 70% accuracy. Convolution
models typically decode frequencies that appear at a certain time point in the
sound signal by using neural responses from that time point until a certain
fixed duration of the response. Using our model, we evaluated several fixed
durations (time-lags) of the neural responses and observed auditory MEG
responses to be most sensitive to spectral content of the sounds at time-lags
of 250 ms to 500 ms. The proposed model should be useful for determining what
aspects of natural sounds are represented by high-dimensional neural responses
and may reveal novel properties of neural signals.

1507.05873	q-bio	cond-mat.soft physics.bio-ph q-bio.SC q-bio.TO	Fiber networks amplify active stress	"  Large-scale force generation is essential for biological functions such as
cell motility, embryonic development, and muscle contraction. In these
processes, forces generated at the molecular level by motor proteins are
transmitted by disordered fiber networks, resulting in large-scale active
stresses. While these fiber networks are well characterized macroscopically,
this stress generation by microscopic active units is not well understood. Here
we theoretically study force transmission in these networks, and find that
local active forces are rectified towards isotropic contraction and strongly
amplified as fibers collectively buckle in the vicinity of the active units.
This stress amplification is reinforced by the networks' disordered nature, but
saturates for high densities of active units. Our predictions are
quantitatively consistent with experiments on reconstituted tissues and
actomyosin networks, and shed light on the role of the network microstructure
in shaping active stresses in cells and tissue.

fundamentally important since it marks the beginning of all major biological
processes. We present a theoretical investigation that probes the role of DNA
sequence symmetry, heterogeneity and chemical composition in the protein search
dynamics. Using a discrete-state stochastic approach with a first-passage
events analysis, which takes into account the most relevant physical-chemical
processes, a full analytical description of the search dynamics is obtained. It
is found that, contrary to existing views, the protein search is generally
faster on DNA with more heterogeneous sequences. In addition, the search
dynamics might be affected by the chemical composition near the target site.
The physical origins of these phenomena are discussed. Our results suggest that
biological processes might be effectively regulated by modifying chemical
composition, symmetry and heterogeneity of a genome.

1507.06160	q-bio	q-bio.MN nlin.AO physics.chem-ph	Sustainability of Transient Kinetic Regimes and Origins of Death	"  It is generally recognized that a distinguishing feature of life is its
peculiar capability to avoid equilibration. The origin of this capability and
its evolution along the timeline of abiogenesis is not yet understood. We
propose to study an analog of this phenomenon that could emerge in
non-biological systems. To this end, we introduce the concept of sustainability
of transient kinetic regimes. This concept is illustrated via investigation of
cooperative effects in an extended system of compartmentalized chemical
oscillators under batch and semi-batch conditions. The computational study of a
model system shows robust enhancement of lifetimes of the decaying oscillations
which translates into the evolution of the survival function of the transient
non-equilibrium regime. This model does not rely on any form of replication.
Rather, it explores the role of a structured effective environment as a
contributor to the system-bath interactions that define non-equilibrium
regimes. We implicate the noise produced by the effective environment of a
compartmentalized oscillator as the cause of the lifetime extension.

1507.06481	q-bio	q-bio.CB	"Coherent motion of monolayer sheets under confinement and its
  pathological implications"	"  Coherent angular rotation of epithelial cells is thought to contribute to
many vital physiological processes including tissue morphogenesis and glandular
formation. However, factors regulating this motion, and the implications of
this motion if perturbed remain incompletely understood. In the current study,
we address these questions using a cell-center based model in which cells are
polarized, motile, and interact with the neighboring cells via harmonic forces.
We demonstrate that, a simple evolution rule in which the polarization of any
cell tends to orient with its velocity vector can induce coherent motion in
geometrically confined environments. In addition to recapitulating coherent
rotational motion observed in experiments, our results also show the presence
of radial movements and tissue behavior that can vary between solid-like and
fluid-like. We show that the pattern of coherent motion is dictated by the
combination of different physical parameters including number density, cell
motility, system size, bulk cell stiffness and stiffness of cell-cell
adhesions. We further observe that, perturbations in the form of cell division
can induce a reversal in the direction of motion when cell division occurs
synchronously. Moreover, when the confinement is removed, we see that the
existing coherent motion leads to cell scattering, with bulk cell stiffness and
stiffness of cell-cell contacts dictating the invasion pattern. In summary, our
study provides an in-depth understanding of the origin of coherent rotation in
confined tissues, and extracts useful insights into the influence of various
physical parameters on the pattern of such movements

heterogeneity of the frequency or amount of interactions among individuals, on
the evolution of cooperation. Based on an analysis of the evolutionary
prisoner's dilemma game on a weighted one-dimensional lattice network with
""intra-individual heterogeneity"", we confirm that moderate level of link-weight
heterogeneity can facilitate cooperation. Furthermore, we identify two key
mechanisms by which link-weight heterogeneity promotes the evolution of
cooperation: mechanisms for spread and maintenance of cooperation. We also

over time-varying networks. A common approach to model time-varying networks is
via Markovian random graph processes. This modeling approach presents the
following limitation: Markovian random graphs can only replicate switching
patterns with exponential inter-switching times, while in real applications
these times are usually far from exponential. In this paper, we introduce a
flexible and tractable extended family of processes able to replicate, with
arbitrary accuracy, any distribution of inter-switching times. We then study
the stability of spreading processes in this extended family. We first show
that a direct analysis based on It\^o's formula provides stability conditions
in terms of the eigenvalues of a matrix whose size grows exponentially with the
number of edges. To overcome this limitation, we derive alternative stability
conditions involving the eigenvalues of a matrix whose size grows linearly with
the number of nodes. Based on our results, we also show that heuristics based
on aggregated static networks approximate the epidemic threshold more
accurately as the number of nodes grows, or the temporal volatility of the
random graph process is reduced. Finally, we illustrate our findings via
numerical simulations.

1507.07021	q-bio	q-bio.BM	"Energy Minimization of Discrete Protein Titration State Models Using
  Graph Theory"	"  There are several applications in computational biophysics which require the
optimization of discrete interacting states; e.g., amino acid titration states,
ligand oxidation states, or discrete rotamer angles. Such optimization can be
very time-consuming as it scales exponentially in the number of sites to be
optimized. In this paper, we describe a new polynomial-time algorithm for
optimization of discrete states in macromolecular systems. This algorithm was
adapted from image processing and uses techniques from discrete mathematics and
graph theory to restate the optimization problem in terms of ""maximum
flow-minimum cut"" graph analysis. The interaction energy graph, a graph in
which vertices (amino acids) and edges (interactions) are weighted with their
respective energies, is transformed into a flow network in which the value of
the minimum cut in the network equals the minimum free energy of the protein,
and the cut itself encodes the state that achieves the minimum free energy.
Because of its deterministic nature and polynomial-time performance, this
algorithm has the potential to allow for the ionization state of larger
proteins to be discovered.

Through a simulation study I find that the AICc is robust if one corrects for

biodiversity quantification, identification of interesting clades and deciding
on the importance of phylogenetic correlations.

whose space arrangement (3D structure) is known, are investigated by using
regular arrays of the amino acids. These structures, specifically cubes, have
topological features similar to those shown by the chosen proteins. The
theoretical results show a good agreement between the predicted current-voltage
characteristics obtained from a cubic array and those obtained from a detailed
3D structure. The agreement is confirmed by available experiments on
bacteriorhodopsin. Furthermore, all the analyzed proteins are found to share
the same critical behaviour of the voltage-dependent conductance and of its
variance. In particular, the cubic arrangement evidences a short plateau of the
excess conductance and its variance at high voltages. The results of the
present investigation show the possibility to predict the I-V characteristics
of multiple-protein sample even in the absence of a detailed knowledge of their
3D structure.

1507.07992	q-bio	physics.comp-ph physics.chem-ph q-bio.PE	"Hybrid approaches for multiple-species stochastic reaction-diffusion
  models"	"  Reaction-diffusion models are used to describe systems in fields as diverse
as physics, chemistry, ecology and biology. The fundamental quantities in such
models are individual entities such as atoms and molecules, bacteria, cells or
animals, which move and/or react in a stochastic manner. If the number of
entities is large, accounting for each individual is inefficient, and often
partial differential equation (PDE) models are used in which the stochastic
behaviour of individuals is replaced by a description of the averaged, or mean
behaviour of the system. In some situations the number of individuals is large
in certain regions and small in others. In such cases, a stochastic model may
be inefficient in one region, and a PDE model inaccurate in another. To
overcome this problem, we develop a scheme which couples a stochastic
reaction-diffusion system in one part of the domain with its mean field
analogue, i.e. a discretised PDE model, in the other part of the domain. The
interface in between the two domains occupies exactly one lattice site and is
chosen such that the mean field description is still accurate there. This way
errors due to the flux between the domains are small. Our scheme can account
for multiple dynamic interfaces separating multiple stochastic and
deterministic domains, and the coupling between the domains conserves the total
number of particles. The method preserves stochastic features such as
extinction not observable in the mean field description, and is significantly
faster to simulate on a computer than the pure stochastic model.

biological networks are still unclear. We here analyze the dynamics of genetic
regulatory networks responsible for the regulation of cell cycle and cell
differentiation in three organisms or cell types each, and show that they obey
a version of Hebb's rule which we term as coherence. More precisely, we find
that simultaneously expressed genes with a common target are less likely to
conflict at the attractors of the regulatory dynamics. We then investigate the
dependence of coherence on structural parameters, such as the mean number of
inputs per node and the activatory/repressory interaction ratio, as well as on
dynamically determined quantities, such as the basin size and the number of
expressed genes.

leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons with short-term synaptic plasticity in the
presence of depressive and facilitating mechanisms. The dynamics is analyzed by
a Heterogeneous Mean-Field approximation, that allows to keep track of the
effects of structural disorder in the network. We describe the complex behavior
of different classes of excitatory and inhibitory components, that give rise to
a rich dynamical phase-diagram as a function of the fraction of inhibitory
neurons. By the same mean field approach, we study and solve a global inverse
problem: reconstructing the degree probability distributions of the inhibitory

knowledge of the average synaptic activity field. This approach unveils new
perspectives in the numerical study of neural network dynamics and in the
possibility of using these models as testbed for the analysis of experimental

1507.08245	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Epistasis and the structure of fitness landscapes: are experimental
  fitness landscapes compatible with Fisher's Geometric model?"	"  The fitness landscape defines the relationship between genotypes and fitness
in a given environment, and underlies fundamental quantities such as the
distribution of selection coefficient, or the magnitude and type of epistasis.
A better understanding of variation of landscape structure across species and
environments is thus necessary to understand and predict how populations will
adapt. An increasing number of experiments investigates the properties of
fitness landscapes by identifying mutations, constructing genotypes with
combinations of these mutations, and measuring the fitness of these genotypes.
Yet these empirical landscapes represent a very small sample of the vast space
of all possible genotypes, and this sample is often biased by the protocol used
to identify mutations. Here we develop a rigorous statistical framework based
on Approximate Bayesian Computation to address these concerns, and use this
flexible framework to fit a broad class of phenotypic fitness models (including
Fisher's model) to 26 empirical landscapes representing 9 diverse biological
systems. In spite of uncertainty due to the small size of most published
empirical landscapes, the inferred landscapes have similar structure in similar
biological systems. Surprisingly, goodness of fit tests reveal that this class
of phenotypic models, which has been successful so far in interpreting
experimental data, is a plausible model in only 3 out of 9 biological systems.
More precisely, although Fisher's model was able to explain several statistical
properties of the landscapes - including mean and standard deviation of
selection and epistasis coefficients -, it was often unable to explain the full
structure of fitness landscapes.

largest ever recorded, representing a fundamental shift in Ebola epidemiology
with unprecedented spatiotemporal complexity. We developed spatial transmission
models using a gravity-model framework to explain spatiotemporal dynamics of
EVD in West Africa at both the national and district-level scales, and to
compare effectiveness of local interventions (e.g. local quarantine) and
long-range interventions (e.g. border-closures). Incorporating spatial
interactions, the gravity model successfully captures the multiple waves of
epidemic growth observed in Guinea. Model simulations indicate that
local-transmission reductions were most effective in Liberia, while long-range
transmission was dominant in Sierra Leone. The model indicates the presence of
spatial herd protection, wherein intervention in one region has a protective
effect on surrounding regions. The district-level intervention analysis
indicates the presence of intervention-amplifying regions, which provide
above-expected levels of reduction in cases and deaths beyond their borders.
The gravity-modeling approach accurately captured the spatial spread patterns
of EVD at both country and district levels, and helps to identify the most
effective locales for intervention. This model structure and intervention
analysis provides information that can be used by public health policymakers to
assist planning and response efforts for future epidemics.

1507.08484	q-bio	q-bio.QM stat.AP	Measuring temporal turnover in ecological communities	"  Range migrations in response to climate change, invasive species and the
emergence of novel ecosystems highlight the importance of temporal turnover in
community composition as a fundamental part of global change in the
Anthropocene. Temporal turnover is usually quantified using a variety of
metrics initially developed to capture spatial change. However, temporal
turnover is the consequence of unidirectional community dynamics resulting from
processes such as population growth, colonisation and local extinction. Here,
we develop a framework based on community dynamics, and propose a new temporal
turnover measure. A simulation study and an analysis of an estuarine fish
community both clearly demonstrate that our proposed turnover measure offers
additional insights relative to spatial-context-based metrics. Our approach
reveals whether community turnover is due to shifts in community composition or
in community abundance, and identifies the species and/or environmental factors
that are responsible for any change.

1507.08505	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Measures of multisensory integration based on dependent probability
  summation: from spike counts to reaction times"	"  A single neuron is categorized as""multisensory"" if there is a statistically
significant difference between the response evoked by an audio-visual stimulus
combination and that evoked by the most effective of its components
individually. Crossmodal enhancement is commonly expressed as a proportion of
the strongest unisensory response. However, being responsive to multiple
sensory modalities does not guarantee that a neuron has actually engaged in
integrating its multiple sensory inputs, rather than simply responding to the
most salient stimulus. Here, we propose an alternative index measuring by how
much the crossmodal response surpasses the level obtainable by optimally
combining the unisensory responses. Optimality is defined by probability
summation combining the unisensory responses under maximal negative stochastic
dependence. The new index is analogous to measuring crossmodal enhancement by
the amount of violation of the ""race model inequality"", which is widely used in
reaction time studies of multisensory integration. Neurons previously labeled
as ""multisensory"" may lose that property since the new index tends to be
smaller than the traditional one. This is exemplified with a data set collected
from single SC neurons. The new easy-to-compute index does not require any
specific distributional assumption. It is sensitive to the variability in the
data, in contrast to the traditional index which, by definition, only depends
on the means of the uni- and crossmodal response distributions.

why such diversity is sustained despite the efficiency of simple replication
systems, using a cell model with catalytic reaction dynamics that grew by
uptake of environmental resources. Limited resources led to increased diversity
of components within the system, and the number of coexisting species increased
with a negative power of the resource abundances. The diversity was explained
from the optimum growth speed of the cell, determined by a tradeoff between the
utility of diverse resources and the concentration onto fewer components to
increase the reaction rate.

participants from each group to check if there is bimodality in the population
and we again found statistically significant difference (w/g < b/b , p-value =
0.0132). Six participants, half from the w/g camp, were administered dilation
drops that increased the pupil size by 3-4mm to check if increase in retinal
illuminance will trigger a change in color in the w/g group, but the

and fluctuations of such kinetics remain similar over a broad range of time
scales. Former studies on humans regularly deprived of sleep or suffering from
sleep disorders predicted change in the invariant scale parameters with respect
to those representative for healthy subjects. In this study we investigate the
signal patterns from actigraphy recordings by means of characteristic measures
of fractional point processes. We analyse spontaneous locomotor activity of
healthy individuals recorded during a week of regular sleep and a week of
chronic partial sleep deprivation. Behavioural symptoms of lack of sleep can be
evaluated by analysing statistics of duration times during active and resting
states, and alteration of behavioural organization can be assessed by analysis
of power laws detected in the event count distribution, distribution of waiting
times between consecutive movements and detrended fluctuation analysis of
recorded time series. We claim that among different measures characterizing
complexity of the actigraphy recordings and their variations implied by chronic
sleep distress, the exponents characterizing slopes of survival functions in
resting states are the most effective biomarkers distinguishing between healthy
and sleep-deprived groups.

comprehensive study of the simplest possible system that includes dispersal and
local interactions, namely a 2-patch 2-species system. We evaluate the impact
of dispersal on stability and on the occurrence of bifurcations, including
pattern forming bifurcations that lead to spatial heterogeneity, in 19
different classes of models with the help of the generalized modelling
approach. We find that dispersal often destabilizes equilibria, but it can
stabilize them if it increases population losses. If dispersal is nonrandom,
i.e. if emigration or immigration rates depend on population densities, the
correlation of stability with migration rates is positive in part of the
models. We also find that many systems show all four types of bifurcations and
that antisynchronous oscillations occur mostly with nonrandom dispersal.

about the world. Combinatorial codes, comprised of binary patterns of neural
activity, encode information via the collective behavior of populations of
neurons. A code is called convex if its codewords correspond to regions defined
by an arrangement of convex open sets in Euclidean space. Convex codes have
been observed experimentally in many brain areas, including sensory cortices
and the hippocampus, where neurons exhibit convex receptive fields. What makes
a neural code convex? That is, how can we tell from the intrinsic structure of
a code if there exists a corresponding arrangement of convex open sets? In this
work, we provide a complete characterization of local obstructions to
convexity. This motivates us to define max intersection-complete codes, a
family guaranteed to have no local obstructions. We then show how our
characterization enables one to use free resolutions of Stanley-Reisner ideals
in order to detect violations of convexity. Taken together, these results
provide a significant advance in understanding the intrinsic combinatorial
properties of convex codes.

1508.00165	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Dynamics of multi-stable states during ongoing and evoked cortical
  activity"	"  Single trial analyses of ensemble activity in alert animals demonstrate that
cortical circuits dynamics evolve through temporal sequences of metastable
states. Metastability has been studied for its potential role in sensory
coding, memory and decision-making. Yet, very little is known about the network
mechanisms responsible for its genesis. It is often assumed that the onset of
state sequences is triggered by an external stimulus. Here we show that state
sequences can be observed also in the absence of overt sensory stimulation.
Analysis of multielectrode recordings from the gustatory cortex of alert rats
revealed ongoing sequences of states, where single neurons spontaneously attain
several firing rates across different states. This single neuron
multi-stability represents a challenge to existing spiking network models,
where typically each neuron is at most bi-stable. We present a recurrent
spiking network model that accounts for both the spontaneous generation of
state sequences and the multi-stability in single neuron firing rates. Each
state results from the activation of neural clusters with potentiated
intra-cluster connections, with the firing rate in each cluster depending on
the number of active clusters. Simulations show that the models ensemble
activity hops among the different states, reproducing the ongoing dynamics
observed in the data. When probed with external stimuli, the model predicts the
quenching of single neuron multi-stability into bi-stability and the reduction
of trial-by-trial variability. Both predictions were confirmed in the data.
Altogether, these results provide a theoretical framework that captures both
ongoing and evoked network dynamics in a single mechanistic model.

1508.00293	q-bio	math.PR q-bio.PE	Limiting the spread of disease through altered migration patterns	"  We consider a model for an epidemic in a population that occupies
geographically distinct locations. The disease is spread within subpopulations
by contacts between infective and susceptible individuals, and is spread
between subpopulations by the migration of infected individuals. We show how
susceptible individuals can act collectively to limit the spread of disease
during the initial phase of an epidemic, by specifying the distribution that
minimises the growth rate of the epidemic when the infectives are migrating so
as to maximise the growth rate. We also give an explicit strategy that
minimises the basic reproduction number, which is also shown be optimal in
terms of the probability of extinction and total size of the epidemic.

  recurrent neural networks"	"  Understanding the theoretical foundations of how memories are encoded and
retrieved in neural populations is a central challenge in neuroscience. A
popular theoretical scenario for modeling memory function is the attractor
neural network scenario, whose prototype is the Hopfield model. The model has a
poor storage capacity, compared with the capacity achieved with perceptron
learning algorithms. Here, by transforming the perceptron learning rule, we
present an online learning rule for a recurrent neural network that achieves
near-maximal storage capacity without an explicit supervisory error signal,
relying only upon locally accessible information. The fully-connected network
consists of excitatory binary neurons with plastic recurrent connections and
non-plastic inhibitory feedback stabilizing the network dynamics; the memory
patterns are presented online as strong afferent currents, producing a bimodal
distribution for the neuron synaptic inputs. Synapses corresponding to active
inputs are modified as a function of the value of the local fields with respect
to three thresholds. Above the highest threshold, and below the lowest
threshold, no plasticity occurs. In between these two thresholds,
potentiation/depression occurs when the local field is above/below an
intermediate threshold. We simulated and analyzed a network of binary neurons
implementing this rule and measured its storage capacity for different sizes of
the basins of attraction. The storage capacity obtained through numerical
simulations is shown to be close to the value predicted by analytical
calculations. We also measured the dependence of capacity on the strength of
external inputs. Finally, we quantified the statistics of the resulting
synaptic connectivity matrix, and found that both the fraction of zero weight
synapses and the degree of symmetry of the weight matrix increase with the
number of stored patterns.

for tumour growth including nutrient diffusion, chemotaxis, active transport,
adhesion, apoptosis and proliferation. The model generalises earlier models and
in particular includes active transport mechanisms which ensure thermodynamic
consistency. We perform a formally matched asymptotic expansion and develop
several sharp interface models. Some of them are classical and some are new
which for example include a jump in the nutrient density at the interface. A
linear stability analysis for a growing nucleus is performed and in particular
the role of the new active transport term is analysed. Numerical computations
are performed to study the influence of the active transport term for specific
growth scenarios.

  physiological parameters"	"  In order to describe the velocity and the anaerobic energy of two runners
competing against each other for middle-distance races, we present a
mathematical model relying on an optimal control problem for a system of
ordinary differential equations. The model is based on energy conservation and
on Newton's second law: resistive forces, propulsive forces and variations in
the maximal oxygen uptake are taken into account. The interaction between the
runners provides a minimum for staying one meter behind one's competitor. We
perform numerical simulations and show how a runner can win a race against
someone stronger by taking advantage of staying behind, or how he can improve
his personal record by running behind someone else. Our simulations show when
it is the best time to overtake, depending on the difference between the
athletes. Finally, we compare our numerical results with real data from the
men's 1500 -- m finals of different competitions.

gene regulatory networks. We investigate the propagation of bursting noise
between different levels of mathematical modelling, and demonstrate that
conventional approaches based on diffusion approximations can fail to capture
bursting noise. An alternative coarse-grained model, the so-called piecewise
deterministic Markov process (PDMP), is seen to outperform the diffusion
approximation in biologically relevant parameter regimes. We provide a
systematic embedding of the PDMP model into the landscape of existing
approaches, and we present analytical methods to calculate its stationary

  transitions in cardiac models"	"  Disruptions in the normal rhythmic functioning of the heart, termed as
arrhythmia, often result from qualitative changes in the excitation dynamics of
the organ. The transitions between different types of arrhythmia are
accompanied by alterations in the spatiotemporal pattern of electrical activity
that can be measured by observing the time-intervals between successive
excitations of different regions of the cardiac tissue. Using biophysically
detailed models of cardiac activity we show that the distribution of these
time-intervals exhibit a systematic change in their skewness during such
dynamical transitions. Further, the leading digits of the normalized intervals
appear to fit Benford's law better at these transition points. This raises the
possibility of using these observations to design a clinical indicator for
identifying changes in the nature of arrhythmia. More importantly, our results
reveal an intriguing relation between the changing skewness of a distribution
and its agreement with Benford's law, both of which have been independently
proposed earlier as indicators of regime shift in dynamical systems.

However, its evolution is constrained by interactions between mutations in its
fitness landscape. Here we show that an Ising model describing these
interactions, inferred from sequence data obtained prior to the use of
antiretroviral drugs, can be used to identify clinically significant sites of
resistance mutations. Successful predictions of the resistance sites indicate
progress in the development of successful models of real viral evolution at the
single residue level, and suggest that our approach may be applied to help
design new therapies that are less prone to failure even where resistance data
is not yet available.

  dynamics"	"  A theoretical model for stratified epithelium is presented. The viscoelastic
properties of the tissue is assumed to be dependent on the spatial distribution
of proliferative and differentiated cells. Based on this assumption, a
hydrodynamic description for tissue dynamics at long-wavelength, long-time
limit is developed, and the analysis reveals important insight for the dynamics
of an epithelium close to its steady state. When the proliferative cells occupy
a thin region close to the basal membrane, the relaxation rate towards the
steady state is enhanced by cell division and cell apoptosis. On the other
hand, when the region where proliferative cells reside becomes sufficiently
thick, a flow induced by cell apoptosis close to the apical surface could
enhance small perturbations. This destabilizing mechanism is general for
continuous self-renewal multi-layered tissues, it could be related to the
origin of certain tissue morphology and developing pattern.

1508.01916	q-bio	q-bio.QM	"CCA Fuzzy Land Cover: a new method for classifying vegetation types and
  coverages and its implications for deforestation analysis"	"  Land cover has been evaluated and classified on the basis of general features
using reflectance or digital levels of photographic or satellite data. One of
the most common methodologies based on CORINE land cover (Coordination of
Information on the Environment) data, which classifies natural cover according
to a small number of categories. This method produces generalizations about the
inventoried areas, resulting in the loss of important floristic and structural
information about vegetation types present (such as palm groves, tall dense
mangroves, and dense forests). This classification forfeits relevant
information on sites with high heterogeneity and diversity. Especially in the
tropics, simplification of coverage types reaches its maximum level with the
use of deforestation analysis, particularly when it is reduced to the two
classes of forests and nonforests. As this paper demonstrates, these results
have considerable consequences for political efforts to conserve the
biodiversity of megadiverse countries. We designed a new methodological
approach that incorporates biological distinctiveness combined with
phytosociological classification of vegetation and its relation to physical
features. This approach is based on parameters obtained through canonical
correspondence analysis on a fuzzy logic model, which are used to construct
multiple coverage maps. This tool is useful for monitoring and analyzing
vegetation dynamics, since it maintains the typological integrity of a
cartographic series. The methodology creates cartographic series congruent in
time and scale, can be applied to multiple and varied satellite inputs, and
always evaluates the same model parameters. We tested this new method in the
southwestern Colombian Caribbean region and compared our results with those
from what we believe are outdated tools used in other analyses of deforestation
around the world.

collective cellular dynamics via a number of signaling pathways. Here, we
investigate the mechanical response of a model biopolymer network due to the
active contraction of embedded cells. Specifically, a graph (bond-node) model
derived from confocal microscopy data is used to represent the network
microstructure, and cell contraction is modeled by applying correlated
displacements at specific nodes, representing the focal adhesion sites. A
force-based stochastic relaxation method is employed to obtain force-balanced
network under cell contraction. We find that the majority of the forces are
carried by a small number of heterogeneous force chains emitted from the
contracting cells. The force chains consist of fiber segments that either
possess a high degree of alignment before cell contraction or are aligned due
to the reorientation induced by cell contraction. Large fluctuations of the
forces along different force chains are observed. Importantly, the decay of the
forces along the force chains is significantly slower than the decay of
radially averaged forces in the system. These results suggest that the fibrous
nature of biopolymer network structure can support long-range force
transmission and thus, long-range mechanical signaling between cells.

  divalent counterion size"	"  The problem of DNA$-$DNA interaction mediated by divalent counterions is
studied using a generalized Grand-canonical Monte-Carlo simulation for a system
of two salts. The effect of the divalent counterion size on the condensation
behavior of the DNA bundle is investigated. Experimentally, it is known that
multivalent counterions have strong effect on the DNA condensation phenomenon.
While tri- and tetra-valent counterions are shown to easily condense free DNA
molecules in solution into toroidal bundles, the situation with divalent
counterions are not as clear cut. Some divalent counterions like Mg$^{+2}$ are
not able to condense free DNA molecules in solution, while some like Mn$^{+2}$
can condense them into disorder bundles. In restricted environment such as in
two dimensional system or inside viral capsid, Mg$^{+2}$ can have strong effect
and able to condense them, but the condensation varies qualitatively with
different system, different coions. It has been suggested that divalent
counterions can induce attraction between DNA molecules but the strength of the
attraction is not strong enough to condense free DNA in solution. However, if
the configuration entropy of DNA is restricted, these attractions are enough to
cause appreciable effects. The variations among different divalent salts might
be due to the hydration effect of the divalent counterions. In this paper, we
try to understand this variation using a very simple parameter, the size of the
divalent counterions. We investigate how divalent counterions with different
sizes can leads to varying qualitative behavior of DNA condensation in
restricted environments. Additionally a Grand canonical Monte-Carlo method for
simulation of systems with two different salts is presented in detail.

1508.02309	q-bio	q-bio.SC	"Estimation of the Diffusion Constant from Intermittent Trajectories with
  Variable Position Uncertainties"	"  The movement of a particle described by Brownian motion is quantified by a
single parameter, $D$, the diffusion constant. The estimation of $D$ from a
discrete sequence of noisy observations is a fundamental problem in biological
single particle tracking experiments since it can report on the environment
and/or the state of the particle itself via hydrodynamic radius. Here we
present a method to estimate $D$ that takes into account several effects that
occur in practice, that are important for correct estimation of $D$, and that
have hitherto not been combined together for estimation of $D$. These effects
are motion blur from finite integration time of the camera, intermittent
trajectories, and time-dependent localization uncertainty. Our estimation
procedure, a maximum likelihood estimation, follows directly from the
likelihood expression for a discretely observed Brownian trajectory that
explicitly includes these effects. The manuscript begins with the formulation
of the likelihood expression and then presents three methods to find the exact
solution. Each method has its own advantages in either computational
robustness, theoretical insight, or the estimation of hidden variables. We then
compare our estimator to previously published estimators using a squared log
loss function to demonstrate the benefit of including these effects.

1508.02598	q-bio	q-bio.PE cs.DS math.CO	"A note on convex characters, Fibonacci numbers and exponential-time
  algorithms"	"  Phylogenetic trees are used to model evolution: leaves are labelled to
represent contemporary species (""taxa"") and interior vertices represent extinct
ancestors. Informally, convex characters are measurements on the contemporary
species in which the subset of species (both contemporary and extinct) that
share a given state, form a connected subtree. Given an unrooted, binary
phylogenetic tree T on a set of n >= 2 taxa, a closed (but fairly opaque)
expression for the number of convex characters on T has been known since 1992,
and this is independent of the exact topology of T. In this note we prove that
this number is actually equal to the (2n-1)th Fibonacci number. Next, we define
g_k(T) to be the number of convex characters on T in which each state appears
on at least k taxa. We show that, somewhat curiously, g_2(T) is also
independent of the topology of T, and is equal to to the (n-1)th Fibonacci
number. As we demonstrate, this topological neutrality subsequently breaks down
for k >= 3. However, we show that for each fixed k >= 1, g_k(T) can be computed
in O(n) time and the set of characters thus counted can be efficiently listed
and sampled. We use these insights to give a simple but effective exact
algorithm for the NP-hard maximum parsimony distance problem that runs in time
$\Theta( \phi^{n} \cdot n^2 )$, where $\phi \approx 1.618...$ is the golden
ratio, and an exact algorithm which computes the tree bisection and
reconnection distance (equivalently, a maximum agreement forest) in time
$\Theta( \phi^{2n}\cdot \text{poly}(n))$, where $\phi^2 \approx 2.619$.

cell fate decision. However, the contribution of the mRNA-miRNA mutual
regulation to bistability is not fully understood. Here, we built a set of
mathematical models of mRNA-miRNA interactions and systematically analyzed the
sensitivity of response curves under various conditions. First, we found that
mRNA-miRNA reciprocal regulation could manifest ultrasensitivity to subserve
the generation of bistability when equipped with a positive feedback loop.
Second, the region of bistability is expanded by a stronger competing mRNA
(ceRNA). Interesting, bistability can be emerged without feedback loop if
multiple miRNA binding sites exist on a target mRNA. Thus, we demonstrated the
importance of simple mRNA-miRNA reciprocal regulation in cell fate decision.

1508.02786	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio.SC	Effects of 3D Geometries on Cellular Gradient Sensing and Polarization	"  During cell migration, cells become polarized, change their shape, and move
in response to various internal and external cues. Cell polarization is defined
through the spatio-temporal organization of molecules such as PI3K or small
GTPases, and is determined by intracellular signaling networks. It results in
directional forces through actin polymerization and myosin contractions. Many
existing mathematical models of cell polarization are formulated in terms of
reaction-diffusion systems of interacting molecules, and are often defined in
one or two spatial dimensions. In this paper, we introduce a 3D
reaction-diffusion model of interacting molecules in a single cell, and find
that cell geometry has an important role affecting the capability of a cell to
polarize, or change polarization when an external signal changes direction. Our
results suggest a geometrical argument why more roundish cells can repolarize
more effectively than cells which are elongated along the direction of the
original stimulus, and thus enable roundish cells to turn faster, as has been
observed in experiments. On the other hand, elongated cells preferentially
polarize along their main axis even when a gradient stimulus appears from
another direction. Furthermore, our 3D model can accurately capture the effect
of binding and unbinding of important regulators of cell polarization to and
from the cell membrane. This spatial separation of membrane and cytosol, not
possible to capture in 1D or 2D models, leads to marked differences of our
model from comparable lower-dimensional models.

  regulatory systems under quasi-steady state conditions"	"  We analyse the effect of intrinsic fluctuations on the properties of bistable
stochastic systems with time scale separation operating under1 quasi-steady
state conditions. We first formulate a stochastic generalisation of the
quasi-steady state approximation based on the semi-classical approximation of
the partial differential equation for the generating function associated with
the Chemical Master Equation. Such approximation proceeds by optimising an
action functional whose associated set of Euler-Lagrange (Hamilton) equations
provide the most likely fluctuation path. We show that, under appropriate
conditions granting time scale separation, the Hamiltonian can be re-scaled so
that the set of Hamilton equations splits up into slow and fast variables,
whereby the quasi-steady state approximation can be applied. We analyse two
particular examples of systems whose mean-field limit has been shown to exhibit
bi-stability: an enzyme-catalysed system of two mutually-inhibitory proteins
and a gene regulatory circuit with self-activation. Our theory establishes that
the number of molecules of the conserved species are order parameters whose
variation regulates bistable behaviour in the associated systems beyond the
predictions of the mean-field theory. This prediction is fully confirmed by
direct numerical simulations using the stochastic simulation algorithm. This
result allows us to propose strategies whereby, by varying the number of
molecules of the three conserved chemical species, cell properties associated
to bistable behaviour (phenotype, cell-cycle status, etc.) can be controlled.

novel expansion of the master equation for the joint process. The resulting
coarse-grained model reduces the dimensionality of the system, describing only
the protein population while fully accounting for the effects of discrete and
fluctuating mRNA population. Closed form expressions for the stationary
distribution of the protein population and mean first-passage times of the
coarse-grained model are derived and large-scale Monte Carlo simulations show
that the analysis accurately describes the individual-based process accounting
for mRNA population, in contrast to the failure of commonly proposed
diffusion-type models.

  diffusion models"	"  Research in psychology and neuroscience has successfully modeled decision
making as a process of noisy evidence accumulation to a decision bound. While
there are several variants and implementations of this idea, the majority of
these models make use of a noisy accumulation between two absorbing boundaries.
A common assumption of these models is that decision parameters, e.g., the rate
of accumulation (drift rate), remain fixed over the course of a decision,
allowing the derivation of analytic formulas for the probabilities of hitting
the upper or lower decision threshold, and the mean decision time. There is
reason to believe, however, that many types of behavior would be better
described by a model in which the parameters were allowed to vary over the
course of the decision process.
  In this paper, we use martingale theory to derive formulas for the mean
decision time, hitting probabilities, and first passage time (FPT) densities of
a Wiener process with time-varying drift between two time-varying absorbing
boundaries. This model was first studied by Ratcliff (1980) in the two-stage
form, and here we consider the same model for an arbitrary number of stages
(i.e. intervals of time during which parameters are constant). Our calculations
enable direct computation of mean decision times and hitting probabilities for
the associated multistage process. We also provide a review of how martingale
theory may be used to analyze similar models employing Wiener processes by
re-deriving some classical results. In concert with a variety of numerical
tools already available, the current derivations should encourage mathematical
analysis of more complex models of decision making with time-varying evidence.

QFA screens can be used to compare the health of cell populations with and

  tropical forests (aboveground biomass)"	"  A nondestructive method for estimating the amount of carbon stored by
individuals, communities, vegetation types, and coverages, as well as their
volume and aboveground biomass, is presented. This methodology is based on
information on carbon stocks obtained through three-dimensional analysis of
tree architecture and artificial neural networks. This technique accurately
incorporates the diversity of plant forms measured in plots, transects, and
relev\'es. Stored carbon in any vegetation type is usually calculated as half
the biomass of sampled individuals, estimated with allometric formulas. The
most complete of these formulas incorporate diameter, height, and specific
gravity of wood but do not consider the variation in carbon stored in different
organs or different species, nor do they include information on the wide array
of architectures present in different plant communities. To develop these
allometric models, many individuals of different species must be sacrificed to
identify and validate samples and to minimize error. It is common to find
cutting-edge studies that encourage logging to improve estimates of carbon. In
our approach we replace this destructive methodology with a new technique for
quantifying global aboveground carbon. We demonstrate that carbon content in
forest aboveground biomass in the pantropics could rise to 723.97 Pg C. This
study shows that a reevaluation of climatic and ecological models is needed to
move toward a better understanding of the adverse effects of climate change,
deforestation, and degradation of tropical vegetation.

1508.03682	q-bio	physics.med-ph math.OC q-bio.TO	Asymmetries arising from the space-filling nature of vascular networks	"  Cardiovascular networks span the body by branching across many generations of
vessels. The resulting structure delivers blood over long distances to supply
all cells with oxygen via the relatively short-range process of diffusion at
the capillary level. The structural features of the network that accomplish
this density and ubiquity of capillaries are often called space-filling. There
are multiple strategies to fill a space, but some strategies do not lead to
biologically adaptive structures by requiring too much construction material or
space, delivering resources too slowly, or using too much power to move blood
through the system. We empirically measure the structure of real networks (18
humans and 1 mouse) and compare these observations with predictions of model
networks that are space-filling and constrained by a few guiding biological
principles. We devise a numerical method that enables the investigation of
space-filling strategies and determination of which biological principles
influence network structure. Optimization for only a single principle creates
unrealistic networks that represent an extreme limit of the possible structures
that could be observed in nature. We first study these extreme limits for two
competing principles, minimal total material and minimal path lengths. We
combine these two principles and enforce various thresholds for balance in the
network hierarchy, which provides a novel approach that highlights the
trade-offs faced by biological networks and yields predictions that better
match our empirical data.

The diameter and size of the immediate neighbourhood of a tree has been

two, three or (more generally) $k$ from a given tree. In this paper we provide
a number of exact and asymptotic results concerning these quantities, and

Regraft -- as well as for the Robinson-Foulds metric on trees.

1508.03788	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"A symmetry-based method to infer structural brain networks from
  tractography data"	"  Recent progress in diffusion MRI and tractography algorithms as well as the
launch of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) have provided brain research with
an abundance of structural connectivity data. In this work, we describe and
evaluate a method that can infer the structural brain network that
interconnects a given set of Regions of Interest (ROIs) from tractography data.
The proposed method, referred to as Minimum Asymmetry Network Inference
Algorithm (MANIA), differs from prior work because it does not determine the
connectivity between two ROIs based on an arbitrary connectivity threshold.
Instead, we exploit a basic limitation of the tractography process: the
observed streamlines from a source to a target do not provide any information
about the polarity of the underlying white matter, and so if there are some
fibers connecting two voxels (or two ROIs) X and Y tractography should be able
in principle to follow this connection in both directions, from X to Y and from
Y to X. We leverage this limitation to formulate the network inference process
as an optimization problem that minimizes the (appropriately normalized)
asymmetry of the observed network. We evaluate the proposed method on a noise
model that randomly corrupts the observed connectivity of synthetic networks.
As a case-study, we apply MANIA on diffusion MRI data from 28 healthy subjects
to infer the structural network between 18 corticolimbic ROIs that are
associated with various neuropsychiatric conditions including depression,
anxiety and addiction.

nodes consists of all secondary structures of a, and whose edge set E consists
of all edges connecting two secondary structures whose base pair distance is 1.
Define the network connectivity, or expected network degree, as the average
number of edges incident to vertices of G. Using algebraic combinatorial
methods, we prove that the asymptotic connectivity of length n homopolymer
sequences is 0:473418 ? n. This raises the question of what other network
properties are characteristic of the network of RNA secondary structures.

  Recognition"	"  Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have attracted much attention
recently, and have shown to be able to recognize thousands of object categories
in natural image databases. Their architecture is somewhat similar to that of
the human visual system: both use restricted receptive fields, and a hierarchy
of layers which progressively extract more and more abstracted features. Yet it
is unknown whether DCNNs match human performance at the task of view-invariant
object recognition, whether they make similar errors and use similar
representations for this task, and whether the answers depend on the magnitude
of the viewpoint variations. To investigate these issues, we benchmarked eight
state-of-the-art DCNNs, the HMAX model, and a baseline shallow model and
compared their results to those of humans with backward masking. Unlike in all
previous DCNN studies, we carefully controlled the magnitude of the viewpoint
variations to demonstrate that shallow nets can outperform deep nets and humans
when variations are weak. When facing larger variations, however, more layers
were needed to match human performance and error distributions, and to have
representations that are consistent with human behavior. A very deep net with
18 layers even outperformed humans at the highest variation level, using the
most human-like representations.

stretching and unzipping forces. Two classes of models are considered. In one
case the origin of elasticity is entropic due to the polymeric correlations,
and in the other the double-stranded DNA is taken to have an intrinsic rigidity
for bending. In both cases single strands are completely flexible. The change
in the elastic constant for the flexible case due to thermally generated
bubbles is obtained exactly. For the case of intrinsic rigidity, the elastic
constant is found to be proportional to the square root of the bubble number
fluctuation.

  models can have estimation problems"	"  State-space models (SSMs) are increasingly used in ecology to model
time-series such as animal movement paths and population dynamics. This type of
hierarchical model is often structured to account for two levels of
variability: biological stochasticity and measurement error. SSMs are flexible.
They can model linear and nonlinear processes using a variety of statistical
distributions. Recent ecological SSMs are often complex, with a large number of
parameters to estimate. Through a simulation study, we show that even simple
linear Gaussian SSMs can suffer from parameter- and state-estimation problems.
We demonstrate that these problems occur primarily when measurement error is
larger than biological stochasticity, the condition that often drives
ecologists to use SSMs. Using an animal movement example, we show how these
estimation problems can affect ecological inference. Biased parameter estimates
of a SSM describing the movement of polar bears (\textit{Ursus maritimus})
result in overestimating their energy expenditure. We suggest potential
solutions, but show that it often remains difficult to estimate parameters.
While SSMs are powerful tools, they can give misleading results and we urge
ecologists to assess whether the parameters can be estimated accurately before
drawing ecological conclusions from their results.

convection-diffusion equation which includes the contribution of an entropic

disease, rumor, and information spread over underlying social and information

scale-free networks; this suggests that disease can spread on such networks,
regardless of how low the contact rate may be. In this paper, I consider six

analyzed by degree-based mean-field theory. I show that the presence or absence

  shallow gradients during morphogenesis"	"  Collective cell responses to exogenous cues depend on cell-cell interactions.
In principle, these can result in enhanced sensitivity to weak and noisy
stimuli. However, this has not yet been shown experimentally, and, little is
known about how multicellular signal processing modulates single cell
sensitivity to extracellular signaling inputs, including those guiding complex
changes in the tissue form and function. Here we explored if cell-cell
communication can enhance the ability of cell ensembles to sense and respond to
weak gradients of chemotactic cues. Using a combination of experiments with
mammary epithelial cells and mathematical modeling, we find that multicellular
sensing enables detection of and response to shallow Epidermal Growth Factor
(EGF) gradients that are undetectable by single cells. However, the advantage
of this type of gradient sensing is limited by the noisiness of the signaling
relay, necessary to integrate spatially distributed ligand concentration
information. We calculate the fundamental sensory limits imposed by this
communication noise and combine them with the experimental data to estimate the
effective size of multicellular sensory groups involved in gradient sensing.
Functional experiments strongly implicated intercellular communication through
gap junctions and calcium release from intracellular stores as mediators of
collective gradient sensing. The resulting integrative analysis provides a
framework for understanding the advantages and limitations of sensory
information processing by relays of chemically coupled cells.

reviewed several behavioral data sets imitating the formal design of the
quantum-mechanical contextuality experiments. The conclusion was that none of
these data sets exhibited contextuality if understood in the generalized sense
proposed in Dzhafarov, Kujala, and Larsson (Found. Phys. 7, 762-782, 2015),
while the traditional definition of contextuality does not apply to these data
because they violate the condition of consistent connectedness (also known as
marginal selectivity, no-signaling condition, no-disturbance principle, etc.).
In this paper we clarify the relationship between (in)consistent connectedness
and (non)contextuality, as well as between the traditional and extended
definitions of (non)contextuality, using as an example the
Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequalities originally designed for detecting
contextuality in entangled particles.

that unwinds and translocates along nucleic acids with an ATP-dependent
mechanism and has a key role in the replication of the viral RNA. An
inchworm-like mechanism for translocation has been proposed based on crystal
structures and single molecule experiments. We here perform atomistic molecular
dynamics in explicit solvent on the microsecond time scale of the available
experimental structures. We also construct and simulate putative intermediates
for the translocation process, and we perform non-equilibrium targeted
simulations to estimate their relative stability. For each of the simulated
structures we carefully characterize the available conformational space, the
ligand binding pocket, and the RNA binding cleft. The analysis of the hydrogen
bond network and of the non-equilibrium trajectories indicates an ATP-dependent
stabilization of one of the protein conformers. Additionally, enthalpy
calculations suggest that entropic effects might be crucial for the
stabilization of the experimentally observed structures.

1508.05317	q-bio	q-bio.MN	"Identification of control targets in Boolean molecular network models
  via computational algebra"	"  Motivation: Many problems in biomedicine and other areas of the life sciences
can be characterized as control problems, with the goal of finding strategies
to change a disease or otherwise undesirable state of a biological system into
another, more desirable, state through an intervention, such as a drug or other
therapeutic treatment. The identification of such strategies is typically based
on a mathematical model of the process to be altered through targeted control
inputs. This paper focuses on processes at the molecular level that determine
the state of an individual cell, involving signaling or gene regulation. The
mathematical model type considered is that of Boolean networks. The potential
control targets can be represented by a set of nodes and edges that can be
manipulated to produce a desired effect on the system. Experimentally, node
manipulation requires technology to completely repress or fully activate a
particular gene product while edge manipulations only require a drug that
inactivates the interaction between two gene products. Results: This paper
presents a method for the identification of potential intervention targets in
Boolean molecular network models using algebraic techniques. The approach
exploits an algebraic representation of Boolean networks to encode the control
candidates in the network wiring diagram as the solutions of a system of
polynomials equations, and then uses computational algebra techniques to find
such controllers. The control methods in this paper are validated through the
identification of combinatorial interventions in the signaling pathways of
previously reported control targets in two well studied systems, a p53-mdm2
network and a blood T cell lymphocyte granular leukemia survival signaling
network.

neuroimaging on the individual subject level. For optimal individual subject
characterization, specific acquisition and analysis features need to be
identified that maximize inter-individual variability while concomitantly
minimizing intra-subject variability. Here we develop a non-parametric
statistical metric that quantifies the degree to which a parameter set allows
this individual subject differentiation. We apply this metric to analyzing
publicly available test-retest resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data sets. We find
that for the question of maximizing individual differentiation, there is a
relative tradeoff between increasing sampling through increased sampling
frequency or increased acquisition time; that for the sizes of the interrogated
data sets, only 4-5 min of acquisition time is necessary to perfectly
differentiate each subject; and that brain regions that most contribute to
individuals unique characterization lie in association cortices thought to
contribute to higher cognitive function. These findings may guide optimal
rs-fMRI experiment design and may aid elucidation of the neural bases for
subject-to-subject differences.

the risks posed by epidemic spreading and informed strategies to contain
disease spread. However, a challenge that has been overlooked is that, as a
disease becomes more prevalent, it can limit the availability of the capital
needed to effectively treat those who have fallen ill. Here we use a simple
mathematical model to gain insight into the dynamics of an epidemic when the
recovery of sick individuals depends on the availability of healing resources
that are generated by the healthy population. We find that epidemics spiral out
of control into ""explosive"" spread if the cost of recovery is above a critical
cost. This can occur even when the disease would die out without the resource
constraint. The onset of explosive epidemics is very sudden, exhibiting a
discontinuous transition under very general assumptions. We find analytical
expressions for the critical cost and the size of the explosive jump in
infection levels in terms of the parameters that characterize the spreading
process. Our model and results apply beyond epidemics to contagion dynamics
that self-induce constraints on recovery, thereby amplifying the spreading
process.

known experimentally to play an important role in protein-ligand
discrimination, yet reliable computation of entropy remains a difficult
problem. Here we describe the first two accurate and efficient algorithms to
compute the conformational entropy for RNA secondary structures, with respect
to the Turner energy model, where free energy parameters are determined from UV
aborption experiments. An algorithm to compute the derivational entropy for RNA
secondary structures had previously been introduced, using stochastic context
free grammars (SCFGs). However, the numerical value of derivational entropy
depends heavily on the chosen context free grammar and on the training set used
to estimate rule probabilities. Using data from the Rfam database, we determine
that both of our thermodynamic methods, which agree in numerical value, are
substantially faster than the SCFG method. Thermodynamic structural entropy is
much smaller than derivational entropy, and the correlation between
length-normalized thermodynamic entropy and derivational entropy is moderately
weak to poor. In applications, we plot the structural entropy as a function of
temperature for known thermoswitches, determine that the correlation between
hammerhead ribozyme cleavage activity and total free energy is improved by
including an additional free energy term arising from conformational entropy,
and plot the structural entropy of windows of the HIV-1 genome. Our software
RNAentropy can compute structural entropy for any user-specified temperature,
and supports both the Turner'99 and Turner'04 energy parameters. It follows
that RNAentropy is state-of-the-art software to compute RNA secondary structure
conformational entropy. The software is available at

  crop-raiding baboons in a managed landscape"	"  The establishment of protected areas or parks has become an important tool
for wildlife conservation. However, frequent occurrences of human-wildlife
conflict at the edges of these parks can undermine their conservation goals.
Many African protected areas have experienced concurrent declines of apex
predators alongside increases in both baboon abundance and the density of
humans living near the park boundary. Baboons then take excursions outside of
the park to raid crops for food, conflicting with the human population. We
model the interactions of mesopredators (baboons), apex predators and shared
prey in the park to analyze how four components affect the proportion of time
that mesopredators choose to crop-raid: 1) the presence of apex predators; 2)
nutritional quality of the crops; 3) mesopredator ""shyness"" about leaving the
park; and 4) human hunting of mesopredators. We predict that the presence of
apex predators in the park is the most effective method for controlling
mesopredator abundance, and hence significantly reduces their impact on crops.
Human hunting of mesopredators is less effective as it only occurs during
crop-raiding excursions. Furthermore, making crops less attractive, for
instance by planting crops further from the park boundary or farming less
nutritional crops, can reduce the amount of time mesopredators crop-raid.

internal representation of the world. During active navigation, these cells
spike only in discrete locations, together encoding a map of the environment.
Electrophysiological recordings have shown that the animal can revisit this map
mentally, during both sleep and awake states, reactivating the place cells that
fired during its exploration in the same sequence they were originally
activated. Although consistency of place cell activity during active navigation
is arguably enforced by sensory and proprioceptive inputs, it remains unclear
how a consistent representation of space can be maintained during spontaneous
replay. We propose a model that can account for this phenomenon and suggests
that a spatially consistent replay requires a number of constraints on the
hippocampal network that affect its synaptic architecture and the statistics of
synaptic connection strengths.

2007 and H3N2 in 2011, and especially 2013-4, when the effectiveness of the
H3N2 vaccine decreased nearly to zero. The amino acid differences of
neuraminidase from prior less virulent strains appear to be small (<1%) when
tabulated through sequence alignments and counting site identities and
similarities. Here we show how analyzing fractal hydropathic forces responsible
for neuraminidase globular compaction and modularity quantifies the mutational
origins of increased virulence. It also predicts vaccine escape and specifies
optimized targets for the 2015 H3N2 vaccine different from the WHO target.
Unlike some earlier methods based on measuring hemagglutinin antigenic drift

finite numbers of proteins. While some circuits act to reduce this noise,
others appear to exploit it. A striking example is the competence circuit in
Bacillus subtilis, which exhibits much larger noise in the duration of its
competence events than a synthetically constructed analog that performs the
same function. Here, using stochastic modeling and fluorescence microscopy, we
show that this larger noise allows cells to exit terminal phenotypic states,
which expands the range of stress levels to which cells are responsive and
leads to phenotypic heterogeneity at the population level. This is an important
example of how noise confers a functional benefit in a genetic decision-making
circuit.

plastic feed-forward networks of nonlinear rate neurons with a correlation
sensitive learning rule inspired by and being qualitatively similar to STDP.
After obtaining equations that describe the change of the spatial shape of the
signal from layer to layer, we derive a criterion for the non-linearity
necessary to obtain stable dynamics for arbitrary input. We classify the
possible scenarios of signal evolution and find that close to the transition to
the unstable regime meta-stable solutions appear. The form of these dissipative
solitons is determined analytically and the evolution and interaction of
several such coexistent objects is investigated.

their environment---a cognitive map. However, both the nature of this cognitive
map and its underpinning in neural structures and activity remains vague. A key
difficulty is that these maps are collective, emergent phenomena that cannot be
reduced to a simple combination of inputs provided by individual neurons. In
this paper we suggest computational frameworks for integrating the spiking
signals of individual cells into a spatial map, which we call schemas. We
provide examples of four schemas defined by different types of topological
relations that may be neurophysiologically encoded in the brain and demonstrate
that each schema provides its own large-scale characteristics of the
environment---the schema integrals. Moreover, we find that, in all cases, these
integrals are learned at a rate which is faster than the rate of complete
training of neural networks. Thus, the proposed schema framework differentiates
between the cognitive aspect of spatial learning and the physiological aspect
at the neural network level.

applications such as the selection of plants and animals of commercial
interest; and it is expected to play an increasing role in medical diagnostics.
Statistical models used for this task are usually tested using
cross-validation, which implicitly assumes that new individuals (whose
phenotypes we would like to predict) originate from the same population the
genomic prediction model is trained on. In this paper we propose an approach
based on clustering and resampling to investigate the effect of increasing
genetic distance between training and target populations when predicting
quantitative traits. This is important for plant and animal genetics, where
genomic selection programs rely on the precision of predictions in future
rounds of breeding. Therefore, estimating how quickly predictive accuracy
decays is important in deciding which training population to use and how often
the model has to be recalibrated. We find that the correlation between true and
predicted values decays approximately linearly with respect to either $\F$ or
mean kinship between the training and the target populations. We illustrate
this relationship using simulations and a collection of data sets from mice,
wheat and human genetics.

plasma membrane and material from the outside. In cells with turgor, pressure
opposes membrane defor- mations, and increases the amount of force that has to
be generated by the endocytic machinery. To determine this force, and calculate
the shape of the membrane, we used physical theory to model an elastic surface
under pressure. Accurate fits of experimental profiles are obtained assuming
that the coated membrane is highly rigid and preferentially curved at the
endocytic site. The forces required from the actin machinery peaks at the onset
of deformation, indicating that once invagination has been initiated,
endocytosis is unlikely to stall before completion. Coat proteins do not lower
the initiation force but may affect the process by the curvature they induce.
In the presence of isotropic curvature inducers, pulling the tip of the
invagination can trigger the formation of a neck at the base of the
invagination. Hence direct neck constriction by actin may not be required,
while its pulling role is essential. Finally, the theory shows that anisotropic
curvature effectors stabilize membrane invaginations, and the loss of
crescent-shaped BAR domain proteins such as Rvs167 could therefore trigger
membrane scission.

substrate, we investigate how the properties of the cell membrane affect the
shape and motility of the cell. Since the membrane influences the cell dynamics
on multiple levels and provides a nontrivial feedback, we consider the
following fundamental interactions: (i) the reduction of the actin
polymerization rate by membrane tension; (ii) area conservation of the cell's
two-dimensional cross-section vs. conservation of its circumference (i.e.
membrane inextensibility); and (iii) the contribution from the membrane's
bending energy to the shape and integrity of the cell. As in experiments, we
investigate two pertinent observables -- the cell's velocity and its aspect
ratio. We find that the most important effect is the feedback of membrane
tension on the actin polymerization. Bending rigidity has only minor effects,
visible mostly in dynamic reshaping events, as exemplified by collisions of the
cell with an obstacle.

  control and elimination in a spatial model of malaria transmission"	"  Mass campaigns with antimalarial drugs are potentially a powerful tool for
local elimination of malaria, yet current diagnostic technologies are
insufficiently sensitive to identify all individuals who harbor infections. At
the same time, overtreatment of uninfected individuals increases the risk of
accelerating emergence of drug resistance and losing community acceptance.
Local heterogeneity in transmission intensity may allow campaign strategies
that respond to index cases to successfully target subpatent infections while
simultaneously limiting overtreatment. While selective targeting of hotspots of
transmission has been proposed as a strategy for malaria control, such
targeting has not been tested in the context of malaria elimination. Using
household locations, demographics, and prevalence data from a survey of four
health facility catchment areas in southern Zambia and an agent-based model of
malaria transmission and immunity acquisition, a transmission intensity was fit
to each household based on neighborhood age-dependent malaria prevalence. A set
of individual infection trajectories was constructed for every household in
each catchment area, accounting for heterogeneous exposure and immunity.
Various campaign strategies (mass drug administration, mass screen and treat,
focal mass drug administration, snowball reactive case detection, pooled
sampling, and a hypothetical serological diagnostic) were simulated and
evaluated for performance at finding infections, minimizing overtreatment,
reducing clinical case counts, and interrupting transmission. For malaria
control, presumptive treatment leads to substantial overtreatment without
additional morbidity reduction under all but the highest transmission
conditions. Selective targeting of hotspots with drug campaigns is an
ineffective tool for elimination due to limited sensitivity of available field
diagnostics.

MSN in freshly isolated, primary murine immune cells. We show that the
functionalized silica nanoparticles are rapidly and efficiently taken up into
the endosomal compartment by specialized antigen-presenting cells such as
dendritic cells. The silica nanoparticles showed a favorable toxicity profile
and did not affect the viability of primary immune cells from the spleen in
relevant concentrations. Cargo-free MSN induced only very low immune responses
in primary cells as determined by surface expression of activation markers and
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-6, -12 and -1\beta.
In contrast, when surface-functionalized MSN with a pH-responsive polymer
capping were loaded with an immune-activating drug, the synthetic Toll-like
receptor 7 agonist R848, a strong immune response was provoked. We thus
demonstrate that MSN represent an efficient drug delivery vehicle to primary
immune cells that is both non-toxic and non-inflammagenic, which is a
prerequisite for the use of these particles in biomedical applications.

  fluctuations"	"  Cellular processes do not follow deterministic rules; even in identical
environments genetically identical cells can make random choices leading to
different phenotypes. This randomness originates from fluctuations present in
the biomolecular interaction networks. Most previous work has been focused on
the intrinsic noise (IN) of these networks. Yet, especially for
high-copy-number biomolecules, extrinsic or environmental noise (EN) has been
experimentally shown to dominate the variation. Here, we develop an analytical
formalism that allows for calculation of the effect of EN on gene-expression
motifs. We introduce a method for modeling bounded EN as an auxiliary species
in the master equation. The method is fully generic and is not limited to
systems with small EN magnitudes. We focus our study on motifs that can be
viewed as the building blocks of genetic switches: a nonregulated gene, a
self-inhibiting gene, and a self-promoting gene. The role of the EN properties
(magnitude, correlation time, and distribution) on the statistics of interest
are systematically investigated, and the effect of fluctuations in different
reaction rates is compared. Due to its analytical nature, our formalism can be
used to quantify the effect of EN on the dynamics of biochemical networks and
can also be used to improve the interpretation of data from single-cell
gene-expression experiments.

or faster-than-Brownian dynamics. Here we show that L\'evy laws, as well as
Gaussians, can also be the limit distributions of processes with long range
memory that exhibit very slow diffusion, logarithmic in time. These processes
are path-dependent and anomalous motion emerges from frequent relocations to
already visited sites. We show how the Central Limit Theorem is modified in
this context, keeping the usual distinction between analytic and non-analytic
characteristic functions. A fluctuation-dissipation relation is also derived.
Our results may have important applications in the study of animal and human
displacements.

  stochastic model based on visual perception"	"  Collective motion is one of the most ubiquitous behaviours displayed by
social organisms and has led to the development of numerous models. Recent
advances in the understanding of sensory system and information processing by
animals impel to revise classical assumptions made in decisional algorithms. In
this context, we present a new model describing the three dimensional visual
sensory system of fish that adjust their trajectory according to their
perception field. Furthermore, we introduce a new stochastic process based on a
probability distribution function to move in targeted directions rather than on
a summation of influential vectors as it is classically assumed by most models.
We show that this model can spontaneously transits from consensus to choice. In
parallel, we present experimental results of zebrafish (alone or in group of
10) swimming in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. We use these
experimental data to set the parameter values of our model and show that this
perception-based approach can simulate the collective motion of species showing
cohesive behaviour in heterogeneous environments. Finally, we discuss the
advances of this multilayer model and its possible outcomes in biological,
physical and robotic sciences.

biomarkers to assist in the detection and diagnosis of cancers in a cost
effective manner at an early stage, when curative interventions are still
possible. Serum autoantibodies are attractive biomarkers for early cancer
detection, but their development has been hindered by the punctuated genetic
nature of the ten million known cancer mutations. A recent study of 50,000
patients (Pedersen et al., 2013) showed p53 15mer epitopes are much more
sensitive colon cancer biomarkers than p53, which in turn is a more sensitive
cancer biomarker than any other protein. The function of p53 as a nearly
universal tumor suppressor is well established, because of its strong
immunogenicity in terms of not only antibody recruitment, but also stimulation
of autoantibodies. Here we examine bioinformatic fractal scaling analysis for
identifying sensitive epitopes from the p53 amino acid sequence, and show how
it could be used for early cancer detection (ECD). We trim 15mers to 7mers, and
identify specific 7mers from other species that could be more sensitive to
aggressive human cancers, such as liver cancer.

1509.01638	q-bio	q-bio.PE math.OC physics.soc-ph	Multi-year optimization of malaria intervention: a mathematical model	"  Malaria is a mosquito-borne, lethal disease that affects millions and kills
hundreds of thousands of people each year. In this paper, we develop a model
for allocating malaria interventions across geographic regions and time,
subject to budget constraints, with the aim of minimizing the number of
person-days of malaria infection. The model considers a range of several
conditions: climatic characteristics, treatment efficacy, distribution costs,
and treatment coverage. We couple an expanded susceptible-infected-recovered
(SIR) compartment model for the disease dynamics with an integer linear
programming (ILP) model for selecting the disease interventions. Our model
produces an intervention plan for all regions, identifying which combination of
interventions, with which level of coverage, to use in each region and year in
a five-year planning horizon. Simulations using the model yield high-level,
qualitative insights on optimal intervention policies: The optimal policy is
different when considering a five-year time horizon than when considering only
a single year, due to the effects that interventions have on the disease
transmission dynamics. The vaccine intervention is rarely selected, except if
its assumed cost is significantly lower than that predicted in the literature.
Increasing the available budget causes the number of person-days of malaria
infection to decrease linearly up to a point, after which the benefit of
increased budget starts to taper. The optimal policy is highly dependent on
assumptions about mosquito density, selecting different interventions for wet
climates with high density than for dry climates with low density, and the
interventions are found to be less effective at controlling malaria in the wet
climates when attainable intervention coverage is 60% or lower. However, when
intervention coverage of 80% is attainable, then malaria prevalence drops
quickly.

1509.01913	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Fractal Fluctuations in Human Walking: Comparison between Auditory and
  Visually Guided Stepping"	"  In human locomotion, sensorimotor synchronization of gait consists of the
coordination of stepping with rhythmic auditory cues (auditory cueing, AC). AC
changes the long-range correlations among consecutive strides (fractal
dynamics) into anti-correlations. Visual cueing (VC) is the alignment of step
lengths with marks on the floor. The effects of VC on the fluctuation structure
of walking have not been investigated. Therefore, the objective was to compare
the effects of AC and VC on the fluctuation pattern of basic spatiotemporal
gait parameters. Thirty-six healthy individuals walked 3 x 500 strides on an
instrumented treadmill with augmented reality capabilities. The conditions were
no cueing (NC), AC, and VC. AC included an isochronous metronome. In VC,
projected stepping stones were synchronized with the treadmill speed. Detrended
fluctuation analysis assessed the correlation structure. The coefficient of
variation (CV) was also assessed. The results showed that AC and VC similarly
induced a strong anti-correlated pattern in the gait parameters. The CVs were
similar between the NC and AC conditions but substantially higher in the VC
condition. AC and VC probably mobilize similar motor control pathways and can
be used alternatively in gait rehabilitation. However, the increased gait
variability induced by VC should be considered.

  Chicks (G. gallus), using Autonomous Robots"	"  Inter-individual variability has various impacts in animal social behaviour.
This implies that not only collective behaviours have to be studied but also
the behavioural variability of each member composing the groups. To understand
those effects on group behaviour, we develop a quantitative methodology based
on automated ethograms and autonomous robots to study the inter-individual
variability among social animals. We choose chicks of \textit{Gallus gallus
domesticus} as a classic social animal model system for their suitability in
laboratory and controlled experimentation. Moreover, even domesticated chicken
present social structures implying forms or leadership and filial imprinting.
We develop an imprinting methodology on autonomous robots to study individual
and social behaviour of free moving animals. This allows to quantify the
behaviours of large number of animals. We develop an automated experimental
methodology that allows to make relatively fast controlled experiments and
efficient data analysis. Our analysis are based on high-throughput data
allowing a fine quantification of individual behavioural traits. We quantify
the efficiency of various state-of-the-art algorithms to automate data analysis
and produce automated ethograms. We show that the use of robots allows to
provide controlled and quantified stimuli to the animals in absence of human
intervention. We quantify the individual behaviour of 205 chicks obtained from
hatching after synchronized fecundation. Our results show a high variability of
individual behaviours and of imprinting quality and success. Three classes of
chicks are observed with various level of imprinting. Our study shows that the
concomitant use of autonomous robots and automated ethograms allows detailed
and quantitative analysis of behavioural patterns of animals in controlled
laboratory experiments.

states and spatial patterning in an $SIS$ model, in which the individuals' are
attached to the vertices of a graph and their mobility is mimicked by varying
the neighbourhood size $q$. The versions with fixed $q$ and those taken at
random at each step and for each individual are studied. Numerical data on the
local behaviour of the model are mapped onto the solution of its zero
dimensional version, corresponding to the limit $q\to +\infty$ and equivalent
to the logistic growth model. This allows for deducing an explicit form of the
dependence of the fraction of infected individuals on the curing rate $\gamma$.
A detailed analysis of the appearance of spatial patterns of infected
individuals in the stationary state is performed.

1509.02045	q-bio	q-bio.MN	A Stochastic Analysis of Autoregulation of Gene Expression	"  This paper analyzes, in the context of a prokaryotic cell, the stochastic
variability of the number of proteins when there is a control of gene
expression by an autoregulation scheme. The goal of this work is to estimate
the efficiency of the regulation to limit the fluctuations of the number of
copies of a given protein. The autoregulation considered in this paper relies
mainly on a negative feedback: the proteins are repressors of their own gene
expression. The efficiency of a production process without feedback control is
compared to a production process with an autoregulation of the gene expression
assuming that both of them produce the same average number of proteins. The
main characteristic used for the comparison is the standard deviation of the
number of proteins at equilibrium. With a Markovian representation and a simple
model of repression, we prove that, under a scaling regime, the repression
mechanism follows a Hill repression scheme with an hyperbolic control. An
explicit asymptotic expression of the variance of the number of proteins under
this regulation mechanism is obtained. Simulations are used to study other
aspects of autoregulation such as the rate of convergence to equilibrium of the
production process and the case where the control of the production process of
proteins is achieved via the inhibition of mRNAs.

quantitatively relating the diversity of a population to its capacity to
respond to selection is challenging. Here, we examine this problem at a
molecular level in the context of populations of partially randomized proteins
selected for binding to well-defined targets. We built several minimal protein
libraries, screened them in vitro by phage display and analyzed their response
to selection by high-throughput sequencing. A statistical analysis of the
results reveals two main findings: first, libraries with same sequence
diversity but built around different ""frameworks"" typically have vastly
different responses, second, the distribution of responses within a library
follows a simple scaling law. We show how an elementary probabilistic model
based on extreme value theory rationalizes these findings. Our results have
implications for designing synthetic protein libraries, for estimating the
density of functional biomolecules in sequence space, for characterizing
diversity in natural populations and for experimentally investigating the
concept of evolvability, or potential for future evolution.

multiple variants competing for survival. To quantify such complex evolutionary
dynamics in vivo, time resolved and genome wide data including rare variants
are essential. We performed whole-genome deep sequencing of HIV-1 populations
in 9 untreated patients, with 6-12 longitudinal samples per patient spanning
5-8 years of infection. We show that patterns of minor diversity are
reproducible between patients and mirror global HIV-1 diversity, suggesting a
universal landscape of fitness costs that control diversity. Reversions towards
the ancestral HIV-1 sequence are observed throughout infection and account for
almost one third of all sequence changes. Reversion rates depend strongly on
conservation. Frequent recombination limits linkage disequilibrium to about
100bp in most of the genome, but strong hitch-hiking due to short range linkage
limits diversity.

1509.02546	q-bio	cond-mat.dis-nn q-bio.NC	On the low dimensional dynamics of structured random networks	"  Using a generalized random recurrent neural network model, and by extending
our recently developed mean-field approach [J. Aljadeff, M. Stern, T. Sharpee,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 088101 (2015)], we study the relationship between the
network connectivity structure and its low dimensional dynamics. Each
connection in the network is a random number with mean 0 and variance that
depends on pre- and post-synaptic neurons through a sufficiently smooth
function $g$ of their identities. We find that these networks undergo a phase
transition from a silent to a chaotic state at a critical point we derive as a
function of $g$. Above the critical point, although unit activation levels are
chaotic, their autocorrelation functions are restricted to a low dimensional
subspace. This provides a direct link between the network's structure and some
of its functional characteristics. We discuss example applications of the
general results to neuroscience where we derive the support of the spectrum of
connectivity matrices with heterogeneous and possibly correlated degree
distributions, and to ecology where we study the stability of the cascade model
for food web structure.

landscape, can be generated in an overdamped ratchet-type stochastic system. We

1509.02781	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Spike-Threshold Variability Originated from Separatrix-Crossing in
  Neuronal Dynamics"	"  The threshold voltage for action potential generation is a key regulator of
neuronal signal transduction, yet the mechanism of its dynamic variation is
still not well described. In this paper, we propose that threshold phenomena
can be classified as parameter thresholds and state thresholds. Voltage
thresholds which belong to the state threshold are determined by the `general
separatrix' in state space. We demonstrate that the separatrix generally exists
in the state space of neuron models. The general form of separatrix was assumed
as the function of both states and stimuli and the previously assumed threshold
evolving equation versus time is naturally deduced from the separatrix. In
terms of neuron dynamics, the threshold voltage variation, which is affected by
different stimuli, is determined by crossing the separatrix at different points
in state space. We suggest that the separatrix-crossing mechanism in state
space is the intrinsic dynamic mechanism for threshold voltages and
post-stimulus threshold phenomena. These proposals are also systematically
verified in example models, three of which have analytic separatrices and one
is the classic Hodgkin-Huxley model. The separatrix-crossing framework provides
an overview of the neuronal threshold and will facilitate understanding of the
nature of threshold variability.

1509.02816	q-bio	q-bio.GN	Bipartite Community Structure of eQTLs	"  Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and eQTL analyses have produced a
large and growing number of genetic associations linked to a wide range of
human phenotypes. As of 2013, there were more than 11,000 SNPs associated with
a trait as reported in the NHGRI GWAS Catalog. However, interpreting the
functional roles played by these SNPs remains a challenge. Here we describe an
approach that uses the inherent bipartite structure of eQTL networks to place
SNPs into a functional context.
  Using genotyping and gene expression data from 163 lung tissue samples in a
study of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) we calculated eQTL
associations between SNPs and genes and cast significant associations (FDR $<
0.1$) as links in a bipartite network. To our surprise, we discovered that the
highly-connected ""hub"" SNPs within the network were devoid of
disease-associations. However, within the network we identified 35 highly
modular communities, which comprise groups of SNPs associated with groups of
genes; 13 of these communities were significantly enriched for distinct
biological functions (P $ < 5 \times 10^{-4}$) including COPD-related
functions. Further, we found that GWAS-significant SNPs were enriched at the
cores of these communities, including previously identified GWAS associations
for COPD, asthma, and pulmonary function, among others. These results speak to
our intuition: rather than single SNPs influencing single genes, we see groups
of SNPs associated with the expression of families of functionally related
genes and that disease SNPs are associated with the perturbation of those
functions. These methods are not limited in their application to COPD and can
be used in the analysis of a wide variety of disease processes and other
phenotypic traits.

1509.03066	q-bio	cond-mat.soft q-bio.BM	Modelling DNA Origami Self-Assembly at the Domain Level	"  We present a modelling framework, and basic model parameterization, for the
study of DNA origami folding at the level of DNA domains. Our approach is
explicitly kinetic and does not assume a specific folding pathway. The binding
of each staple is associated with a free-energy change that depends on staple
sequence, the possibility of coaxial stacking with neighbouring domains, and
the entropic cost of constraining the scaffold by inserting staple crossovers.
A rigorous thermodynamic model is difficult to implement as a result of the
complex, multiply connected geometry of the scaffold: we present a solution to
this problem for planar origami. Coaxial stacking and entropic terms,
particularly when loop closure exponents are taken to be larger than those for
ideal chains, introduce interactions between staples. These cooperative
interactions lead to the prediction of sharp assembly transitions with notable
hysteresis that are consistent with experimental observations. We show that the
model reproduces the experimentally observed consequences of reducing staple
concentration, accelerated cooling and absent staples. We also present a
simpler methodology that gives consistent results and can be used to study a
wider range of systems including non-planar origami.

  Nanoparticles with Multifunctional Polymer Caps"	"  A new general route for siRNA delivery is presented combining porous
core-shell silica nanocarriers with a modularly designed multifunctional block
copolymer. Specifically, the internal storage and release of siRNA from
mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) with orthogonal core-shell surface
chemistry was investigated as a function of pore-size, pore morphology, surface
properties and pH. Very high siRNA loading capacities of up to 380 microg/mg
MSN were obtained with charge-matched amino-functionalized mesoporous cores,
and release profiles show up to 80% siRNA elution after 24 h. We demonstrate
that adsorption and desorption of siRNA is mainly driven by electrostatic
interactions, which allow for high loading capacities even in medium-sized
mesopores with pore diameters down to 4 nm in a stellate pore morphology. The
negatively charged MSN shell enabled the association with a block copolymer
containing positively charged artificial amino acids and oleic acid blocks,
which acts simultaneously as capping function and endosomal release agent. The
potential of this multifunctional delivery platform is demonstrated by highly
effective cell transfection and siRNA delivery into KB-cells. A luciferase
reporter gene knock-down of up to 90% was possible using extremely low cell
exposures with only 2.5 microg MSN containing 32 pM siRNA per 100 microL well.

1509.03153	q-bio	math.DS q-bio.MN	"Graphical reduction of reaction networks by linear elimination of
  species"	"  The quasi-steady state approximation and time-scale separation are commonly
applied methods to simplify models of biochemical reaction networks based on
ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The concentrations of the ""fast""
species are assumed effectively to be at steady state with respect to the
""slow"" species. Under this assumption the steady state equations can be used to
eliminate the ""fast"" variables and a new ODE system with only the slow species
can be obtained.
  We interpret a reduced system obtained by time-scale separation as the ODE
system arising from a unique reaction network, by identification of a set of
reactions and the corresponding rate functions. The procedure is graphically
based and can easily be worked out by hand for small networks. For larger
networks, we provide a pseudo-algorithm. We study properties of the reduced
network, its kinetics and conservation laws, and show that the kinetics of the
reduced network fulfil realistic assumptions, provided the original network
does. We illustrate our results using biological examples such as substrate
mechanisms, post-translational modification systems and networks with
intermediates (transient) steps.

1509.03192	q-bio	q-bio.PE math.AP	"Revisiting the stability of spatially heterogeneous predator-prey
  systems under eutrophication"	"  We employ partial integro-differential equations to model trophic interaction
in a spatially extended heterogeneous environment. Compared to classical
reaction-diffusion models, this framework allows us to more realistically
describe the situation where movement of individuals occurs on a faster time
scale than the demographic (population) time scale, and we cannot determine
population growth based on local density. However, most of the results reported
so far for such systems have only been verified numerically and for a
particular choice of model functions, which obviously casts doubts about these
findings. In this paper, we analyse a class of integro-differential
predator-prey models with a highly mobile predator in a heterogeneous
environment, and we reveal the main factors stabilizing such systems. In
particular, we explore an ecologically relevant case of interactions in a
highly eutrophic environment, where the prey carrying capacity can be formally
set to 'infinity'. We investigate two main scenarios: (i) the spatial gradient
of the growth rate is due to abiotic factors only, and (ii) the local growth
rate depends on the global density distribution across the environment (e.g.
due to non-local self-shading). For an arbitrary spatial gradient of the prey
growth rate, we analytically investigate the possibility of the predator-prey
equilibrium in such systems and we explore the conditions of stability of this
equilibrium. In particular, we demonstrate that for a Holling type I (linear)
functional response, the predator can stabilize the system at low prey density
even for an 'unlimited' carrying capacity. We conclude that the interplay
between spatial heterogeneity in the prey growth and fast displacement of the
predator across the habitat works as an efficient stabilizing mechanism.

1509.03328	q-bio	q-bio.NC math.CO	Obstructions to convexity in neural codes	"  How does the brain encode spatial structure? One way is through hippocampal
neurons called place cells, which become associated to convex regions of space
known as their receptive fields: each place cell fires at a high rate precisely
when the animal is in the receptive field. The firing patterns of multiple
place cells form what is known as a convex neural code. How can we tell when a
neural code is convex? To address this question, Giusti and Itskov identified a
local obstruction, defined via the topology of a code's simplicial complex, and
proved that convex neural codes have no local obstructions. Curto et al. proved
the converse for all neural codes on at most four neurons. Via a counterexample
on five neurons, we show that this converse is false in general. Additionally,
we classify all codes on five neurons with no local obstructions. This
classification is enabled by our enumeration of connected simplicial complexes
on 5 vertices up to isomorphism. Finally, we examine how local obstructions are
related to maximal codewords (maximal sets of neurons that co-fire). Curto et
al. proved that a code has no local obstructions if and only if it contains
certain ""mandatory"" intersections of maximal codewords. We give a new criterion
for an intersection of maximal codewords to be non-mandatory, and prove that it
classifies all such non-mandatory codewords for codes on up to 5 neurons.

1509.03621	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Stimuli reduce the dimensionality of cortical activity	"  The activity of ensembles of simultaneously recorded neurons can be
represented as a set of points in the space of firing rates. Even though the
dimension of this space is equal to the ensemble size, neural activity can be
effectively localized on smaller subspaces. The dimensionality of the neural
space is an important determinant of the computational tasks supported by the
neural activity. Here, we investigate the dimensionality of neural ensembles
from the sensory cortex of alert rats during period of ongoing (inter-trial)
and stimulus-evoked activity. We find that dimensionality grows linearly with
ensemble size, and grows significantly faster during ongoing activity compared
to evoked activity. We explain these results using a spiking network model
based on a clustered architecture. The model captures the difference in growth
rate between ongoing and evoked activity and predicts a characteristic scaling
with ensemble size that could be tested in high-density multi-electrode
recordings. Moreover, the model predicts the existence of an upper bound on
dimensionality. This upper bound is inversely proportional to the amount of
pair-wise correlations and, compared to a homogeneous network without clusters,
it is larger by a factor equal to the number of clusters. The empirical
estimation of such bounds depends on the number and duration of trials.
Together, these results provide a framework to analyze neural dimensionality in
alert animals, its behavior under stimulus presentation, and its theoretical
dependence on ensemble size, number of clusters, and pair-wise correlations in
spiking network models.

sciences over the past thirty years. More experimental data is now required for
publication, and the average time required for graduate students to publish
their first paper has increased and is approaching the desirable duration of
Ph.D. training. Since publication is generally a requirement for career
progression, schemes to reduce the time of graduate student and postdoctoral
training may be difficult to implement without also considering new mechanisms
for accelerating communication of their work. The increasing time to
publication also delays potential catalytic effects that ensue when many

1509.03777	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Structural symmetry in evolutionary games	"  In evolutionary game theory, an important measure of a mutant trait
(strategy) is its ability to invade and take over an otherwise-monomorphic
population. Typically, one quantifies the success of a mutant strategy via the
probability that a randomly occurring mutant will fixate in the population.
However, in a structured population, this fixation probability may depend on
where the mutant arises. Moreover, the fixation probability is just one
quantity by which one can measure the success of a mutant; fixation time, for
instance, is another. We define a notion of homogeneity for evolutionary games
that captures what it means for two single-mutant states, i.e. two
configurations of a single mutant in an otherwise-monomorphic population, to be
""evolutionarily equivalent"" in the sense that all measures of evolutionary
success are the same for both configurations. Using asymmetric games, we argue
that the term ""homogeneous"" should apply to the evolutionary process as a whole
rather than to just the population structure. For evolutionary matrix games in
graph-structured populations, we give precise conditions under which the
resulting process is homogeneous. Finally, we show that asymmetric matrix games
can be reduced to symmetric games if the population structure possesses a
sufficient degree of symmetry.

affects the cellular switching dynamics between different metastable phenotypic
states. Motivated by this scenario, we study a general problem of switching or
escape in stochastic populations, where influx of particles occurs in groups or
bursts, sampled from an arbitrary distribution. The fact that the step size of
the influx reaction is a-priori unknown, and in general, may fluctuate in time
with a given correlation time and statistics, introduces an additional
non-demographic step-size noise into the system. Employing the probability
generating function technique in conjunction with Hamiltonian formulation, we
are able to map the problem in the leading order onto solving a stationary
Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We show that bursty influx exponentially decreases
the mean escape time compared to the ""usual case"" of single-step influx. In
particular, close to bifurcation we find a simple analytical expression for the
mean escape time, which solely depends on the mean and variance of the
burst-size distribution. Our results are demonstrated on several realistic
distributions and compare well with numerical Monte-Carlo simulations.

  rewiring"	"  We consider recurrent contagious processes on a time-varying network. As a
control procedure to mitigate the epidemic, we propose an adaptive rewiring
mechanism for temporary isolation of infected nodes upon their detection. As a
case study, we investigate the network of pig trade in Germany. Based on
extensive numerical simulations for a wide range of parameters, we demonstrate
that the adaptation mechanism leads to a significant extension of the parameter
range, for which most of the index nodes (origins of the epidemic) lead to
vanishing epidemics. Furthermore the performance of adaptation is very
heterogeneous with respect to the index node. We quantify the success of the
proposed adaptation scheme in dependence on the infectious period and the
detection time. To support our findings we propose a mean-field analytical
description of the problem.

  polytopes for RNA sequences"	"  Questions in computational molecular biology generate various discrete
optimization problems, such as DNA sequence alignment and RNA secondary
structure prediction. However, the optimal solutions are fundamentally
dependent on the parameters used in the objective functions. The goal of a
parametric analysis is to elucidate such dependencies, especially as they
pertain to the accuracy and robustness of the optimal solutions. Techniques
from geometric combinatorics, including polytopes and their normal fans, have
been used previously to give parametric analyses of simple models for DNA
sequence alignment and RNA branching configurations. Here, we present a new
computational framework, and proof-of-principle results, which give the first
complete parametric analysis of the branching portion of the nearest neighbor
thermodynamic model for secondary structure prediction for real RNA sequences.

1509.04145	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio.GN q-bio.SC	The physics of epigenetics	"  In higher organisms, all cells share the same genome, but every cell
expresses only a limited and specific set of genes that defines the cell type.
During cell division, not only the genome, but also the cell type is inherited
by the daughter cells. This intriguing phenomenon is achieved by a variety of
processes that have been collectively termed epigenetics: the stable and
inheritable changes in gene expression patterns. This article reviews the
extremely rich and exquisitely multi-scale physical mechanisms that govern the
biological processes behind the initiation, spreading and inheritance of
epigenetic states. These include not only the changes in the molecular
properties associated with the chemical modifications of DNA and histone
proteins, such as methylation and acetylation, but also less conventional ones,
such as the physics that governs the three-dimensional organization of the
genome in cell nuclei. Strikingly, to achieve stability and heritability of
epigenetic states, cells take advantage of many different physical principles,
such as the universal behavior of polymers and copolymers, the general features
of non-equilibrium dynamical systems, and the electrostatic and mechanical
properties related to chemical modifications of DNA and histones. By putting
the complex biological literature under this new light, the emerging picture is
that a limited set of general physical rules play a key role in initiating,
shaping and transmitting this crucial ""epigenetic landscape"". This new
perspective not only allows to rationalize the normal cellular functions, but
also helps to understand the emergence of pathological states, in which the
epigenetic landscape becomes dysfunctional.

greatly increase the tendency of asexually reproducing phenotypically diverse
organisms to spontaneously evolve into localised clusters, suggesting a simple
mechanism for sympatric speciation. Here we study the role of demographic
stochasticity in a model of competing organisms subject to assortative mating.
We find that in models with sexual reproduction, noise can also lead to the
formation of phenotypic clusters in parameter ranges where deterministic models
would lead to a homogeneous distribution. In some cases, noise can have a
sizeable effect, rendering the deterministic modelling insufficient to
understand the phenotypic distribution.

unstable manifolds that contain orbits connecting each $O_k$ to the next two
equilibrium points $O_{k+1}$ and $O_{k+2}$ in the chain ($O_{p+1} = O_1$). We
show that the union of these equilibria and their unstable manifolds form a
$2$-dimensional surface with boundary that is homeomorphic to a cylinder if $p$
is even and a M\""{o}bius strip if $p$ is odd. If, further, each equilibrium in
the chain satisfies a condition called ``dissipativity,"" then this surface is
asymptotically stable.

  Connections {\em via} Persistent Homology"	"  In many human brain network studies, we do not have sufficient number (n) of
images relative to the number (p) of voxels due to the prohibitively expensive
cost of scanning enough subjects. Thus, brain network models usually suffer the
small-n large-p problem. Such a problem is often remedied by sparse network
models, which are usually solved numerically by optimizing L1-penalties.
Unfortunately, due to the computational bottleneck associated with optimizing
L1-penalties, it is not practical to apply such methods to construct
large-scale brain networks at the voxel-level. In this paper, we propose a new
scalable sparse network model using cross-correlations that bypass the
computational bottleneck. Our model can build sparse brain networks at the
voxel level with p > 25000. Instead of using a single sparse parameter that may
not be optimal in other studies and datasets, the computational speed gain
enables us to analyze the collection of networks at every possible sparse
parameter in a coherent mathematical framework via persistent homology. The
method is subsequently applied in determining the extent of heritability on a
functional brain network at the voxel-level for the first time using twin fMRI.

1509.05188	q-bio	q-bio.GN physics.bio-ph	The Bulk and The Tail of Minimal Absent Words in Genome Sequences	"  Minimal absent words (MAW) of a genomic sequence are subsequences that are
absent themselves but the subwords of which are all present in the sequence.
The characteristic distribution of genomic MAWs as a function of their length
has been observed to be qualitatively similar for all living organisms, the
bulk being rather short, and only relatively few being long. It has been an
open issue whether the reason behind this phenomenon is statistical or reflects
a biological mechanism, and what biological information is contained in absent
words. In this work we demonstrate that the bulk can be described by a
probabilistic model of sampling words from random sequences, while the tail of
long MAWs is of biological origin. We introduce the novel concept of a core of
a minimal absent word, which are sequences present in the genome and closest to
a given MAW. We show that in bacteria and yeast the cores of the longest MAWs,
which exist in two or more copies, are located in highly conserved regions the
most prominent example being ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). We also show that while
the distribution of the cores of long MAWs is roughly uniform over these
genomes on a coarse-grained level, on a more detailed level it is strongly
enhanced in 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) and, to a lesser extent, also in 5'
UTRs. This indicates that MAWs and associated MAW cores correspond to
fine-tuned evolutionary relationships, and suggest that they can be more widely
used as markers for genomic complexity.

1509.05215	q-bio	physics.bio-ph cond-mat.soft nlin.PS q-bio.CB	Simple model of cell crawling	"  Based on symmetry consideration of migration and shape deformations, we
formulate phenomenologically the dynamics of cell crawling in two dimensions.
Forces are introduced to change the cell shape. The shape deformations induce
migration of the cell on a substrate. For time-independent forces we show that
not only a stationary motion but also a limit cycle oscillation of the
migration velocity and the shape occurs as a result of nonlinear coupling
between different deformation modes. Time-dependent forces are generated in a
stochastic manner by utilizing the so-called coherence resonance of an
excitable system. The present coarse-grained model has a flexibility that it
can be applied, e.g., both to keratocyte cells and to Dictyostelium cells,
which exhibit quite different dynamics from each other. The key factors for the
motile behavior inherent in each cell type are identified in our model.

  by combining global sensitivity analysis and dynamic modeling in wheat"	"  A crop can be viewed as a complex system with outputs (e.g. yield) that are
affected by inputs of genetic, physiology, pedo-climatic and management
information. Application of numerical methods for model exploration assist in
evaluating the major most influential inputs, providing the simulation model is
a credible description of the biological system. A sensitivity analysis was
used to assess the simulated impact on yield of a suite of traits involved in
major processes of crop growth and development, and to evaluate how the
simulated value of such traits varies across environments and in relation to
other traits (which can be interpreted as a virtual change in genetic
background). The study focused on wheat in Australia, with an emphasis on
adaptation to low rainfall conditions. A large set of traits (90) was evaluated
in a wide target population of environments (4 sites x 125 years), management
practices (3 sowing dates x 2 N fertilization) and $CO_2$ (2 levels). The
Morris sensitivity analysis method was used to sample the parameter space and
reduce computational requirements, while maintaining a realistic representation
of the targeted trait x environment x management landscape ($\sim$ 82 million
individual simulations in total). The patterns of parameter x environment x
management interactions were investigated for the most influential parameters,
considering a potential genetic range of +/- 20% compared to a reference. Main
(i.e. linear) and interaction (i.e. non-linear and interaction) sensitivity
indices calculated for most of APSIM-Wheat parameters allowed the identifcation
of 42 parameters substantially impacting yield in most target environments.
Among these, a subset of parameters related to phenology, resource acquisition,
resource use efficiency and biomass allocation were identified as potential
candidates for crop (and model) improvement.

Previously, both experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated that
autaptic connections in the nervous system have a significant physiological
function. Autapses in nature provide self-delayed feedback, thus introducing an
additional time scale to neuronal activities and causing many dynamic behaviors
in neurons. Recently, theoretical studies have revealed that an autapse
provides a control option for adjusting the response of a neuron: e.g., an
autaptic connection can cause the electrical activities of the Hindmarsh-Rose
neuron to switch between quiescent, periodic, and chaotic firing patterns; an
autapse can enhance or suppress the mode-locking status of a neuron injected
with sinusoidal current; and the firing frequency and interspike interval
distributions of the response spike train can also be modified by the autapse.
In this paper, we review recent studies that showed how an autapse affects the
response of a single neuron.

  Connectomes and the Development of the Connections in the Human Brain"	"  The human connectome is the object of an intensive research today. In these
graphs, the vertices correspond to the small areas of the gray matter, and two
vertices are connected by an edge, if a diffusion-MRI based workflow finds
connections between those areas. One main question of the field is discovering
the directions of the edges. In a previous work we have reported the
construction of the Budapest Reference Connectome Server
http://connectome.pitgroup.org from the data recorded in the Human Connectome
Project of the NIH. After the server had been published, we recognized a
surprising and unforeseen property of it: The server can generate the
braingraph of connections that are present in at least $k$ graphs out of the
418, for any value of $k=1,2,...,418$. When the value of $k$ is changed from
$k=418$ through 1 by moving a slider at the webserver from right to left, more
and more edges appear in the consensus graph. The astonishing observation is
that the appearance of the new edges is not random: it is similar to a growing
tree. We hypothesize that this movement of the slider in the webserver may copy
the development of the connections in the human brain in the following sense:
the connections that are present in all subjects are the oldest ones, and those
that are present in a decreasing fraction of subjects are gradually the newer
connections in the individual brain development. An animation on the phenomenon
is available at https://youtu.be/EnWwIf_HNjw. Based on this hypothesis, we can
assign directions to the edges of the connectome as follows: Let $G_i$ denote
the consensus connectome where each edge is present in at least $i$ graphs.
Suppose that vertex $v$ is isolated in $G_{k+1}$, and becomes connected to a
vertex $u$ in $G_k$, where $u$ was connected to other vertices already in
$G_{k+1}$. Then we direct this $(v,u)$ edge from $v$ to $u$.

an equilibrium with rate $\mu$. We show that, while increasing the ratio of the

transition from a topologically trivial phase portrait with a single
equilibrium into a topologically non-trivial regime characterised by an
exponential number of equilibria, the vast majority of which are expected to be
unstable. It is suggested that this picture provides a global view on the
nature of the May-Wigner instability transition originally discovered by local
linear stability analysis.

1509.05757	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Assortment and the evolution of cooperation in a Moran process with
  exponential fitness"	"  We study the evolution of cooperation in a finite population interacting
according to a simple model of like-with-like assortment. Evolution proceeds as
a Moran process, and payoffs from the underlying cooperator-defector game are
translated to positive fitnesses by an exponential transformation. These
evolutionary dynamics can arise, for example, in a nest-structured population
with rare migration. The use of the exponential transformation, rather than the
usual linear one, is appropriate when interactions have multiplicative fitness
effects, and allows for a tractable characterization of the effect of
assortment on the evolution of cooperation. We define two senses in which a
greater degree of assortment can favour the evolution of cooperation, the first
stronger than the second: (i) greater assortment increases, at all population
states, the probability that the number of cooperators increases, relative to
the probability that the number of defectors increases; and (ii) greater
assortment increases the fixation probability of cooperation, relative to that
of defection. We show that, by the stronger definition, greater assortment
favours the evolution of cooperation for a subset of cooperative dilemmas:
prisoners' dilemmas, snowdrift games, stag-hunt games, and some prisoners'
delight games. For other cooperative dilemmas, greater assortment favours
cooperation by the weak definition, but not by the strong definition. Our
results hold for any strength of selection.

firing rates and their derivatives and that results in changes consistent with
those associated with spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) rules and
biological observations, even though the explicit timing of spikes is not
needed. The new rule changes a synaptic weight in proportion to the product of
the presynaptic firing rate and the temporal rate of change of activity on the
postsynaptic side. These quantities are interesting for studying theoretical
explanation for synaptic changes from a machine learning perspective. In
particular, if neural dynamics moved neural activity towards reducing some
objective function, then this STDP rule would correspond to stochastic gradient
descent on that objective function.

type of repeated sequences common in the human genome are tandem repeats, where
identical copies appear next to each other. For example, in the sequence
$AGTC\underline{TGTG}C$, $TGTG$ is a tandem repeat, that may be generated from
$AGTCTGC$ by a tandem duplication of length $2$. In this work, we investigate
the possibility of generating a large number of sequences from a \textit{seed},
i.e.\ a small initial string, by tandem duplications of bounded length. We
study the capacity of such a system, a notion that quantifies the system's
generating power. Our results include \textit{exact capacity} values for
certain tandem duplication string systems. In addition, motivated by the role
of DNA sequences in expressing proteins via RNA and the genetic code, we define
the notion of the \textit{expressiveness} of a tandem duplication system as the
capability of expressing arbitrary substrings. We then \textit{completely}
characterize the expressiveness of tandem duplication systems for general
alphabet sizes and duplication lengths. In particular, based on a celebrated
result by Axel Thue from 1906, presenting a construction for ternary
square-free sequences, we show that for alphabets of size 4 or larger, bounded
tandem duplication systems, regardless of the seed and the bound on duplication
length, are not fully expressive, i.e. they cannot generate all strings even as
substrings of other strings. Note that the alphabet of size 4 is of particular
interest as it pertains to the genomic alphabet. Building on this result, we
also show that these systems do not have full capacity. In general, our results
illustrate that duplication lengths play a more significant role than the seed
in generating a large number of sequences for these systems.

1509.06034	q-bio	math.DS q-bio.MN	Intermediates, Catalysts, Persistence, and Boundary Steady States	"  For dynamical systems arising from chemical reaction networks, persistence is
the property that each species concentration remains positively bounded away
from zero, as long as species concentrations were all positive in the
beginning. We describe two graphical procedures for simplifying reaction
networks without breaking known necessary or sufficient conditions for
persistence, by iteratively removing so-called intermediates and catalysts from
the network. The procedures are easy to apply and, in many cases, lead to
highly simplified network structures, such as monomolecular networks. For
specific classes of reaction networks, we show that these conditions for
persistence are equivalent to one another. Furthermore, they can also be
characterized by easily checkable strong connectivity properties of a related
graph. In particular, this is the case for (conservative) monomolecular
networks, as well as cascades of a large class of post-translational
modification systems (of which the MAPK cascade and the $n$-site futile cycle
are prominent examples). Since one of the aforementioned sufficient conditions
for persistence precludes the existence of boundary steady states, our method
also provides a graphical tool to check for that.

  incomplete lineage sorting"	"  Phylogenetic networks are necessary to represent the tree of life expanded by
edges to represent events such as horizontal gene transfers, hybridizations or
gene flow. Not all species follow the paradigm of vertical inheritance of their
genetic material. While a great deal of research has flourished into the
inference of phylogenetic trees, statistical methods to infer phylogenetic
networks are still limited and under development. The main disadvantage of
existing methods is a lack of scalability. Here, we present a statistical
method to infer phylogenetic networks from multi-locus genetic data in a
pseudolikelihood framework. Our model accounts for incomplete lineage sorting
through the coalescent model, and for horizontal inheritance of genes through
reticulation nodes in the network. Computation of the pseudolikelihood is fast
and simple, and it avoids the burdensome calculation of the full likelihood
which can be intractable with many species. Moreover, estimation at the
quartet-level has the added computational benefit that it is easily
parallelizable. Simulation studies comparing our method to a full likelihood
approach show that our pseudolikelihood approach is much faster without
compromising accuracy. We applied our method to reconstruct the evolutionary
relationships among swordtails and platyfishes ($Xiphophorus$: Poeciliidae),
which is characterized by widespread hybridizations.

The solution is based on the iterative search for constrained dense

a parallel implementation are discussed. The operation of the method is shown

  Systems"	"  The inherent complexity of biological systems gives rise to complicated
mechanistic models with a large number of parameters. On the other hand, the
collective behavior of these systems can often be characterized by a relatively
small number of phenomenological parameters. We use the Manifold Boundary
Approximation Method (MBAM) as a tool for deriving simple phenomenological
models from complicated mechanistic models. The resulting models are not black
boxes, but remain expressed in terms of the microscopic parameters. In this
way, we explicitly connect the macroscopic and microscopic descriptions,
characterize the equivalence class of distinct systems exhibiting the same
range of collective behavior, and identify the combinations of components that
function as tunable control knobs for the behavior. We demonstrate the
procedure for adaptation behavior exhibited by the EGFR pathway. From a 48
parameter mechanistic model, the system can be effectively described by a
single adaptation parameter $\tau$ characterizing the ratio of time scales for
the initial response and recovery time of the system which can in turn be
expressed as a combination of microscopic reaction rates, Michaelis-Menten
constants, and biochemical concentrations. The situation is not unlike modeling
in physics in which microscopically complex processes can often be renormalized
into simple phenomenological models with only a few effective parameters. The
proposed method additionally provides a mechanistic explanation for
non-universal features of the behavior.

  Quadruplexes Studied by Standard and T-REMD Simulations"	"  DNA G-hairpins are potential key structures participating in folding of human
telomeric guanine quadruplexes (GQ). We examined their properties by standard
MD simulations starting from the folded state and long T-REMD starting from the
unfolded state, accumulating ~130 {\mu}s of atomistic simulations. Antiparallel
G-hairpins should spontaneously form in all stages of the folding to support
lateral and diagonal loops, with sub-{\mu}s scale rearrangements between them.
We found no clear predisposition for direct folding into specific GQ topologies
with specific syn/anti patterns. Our key prediction stemming from the T-REMD is
that an ideal unfolded ensemble of the full GQ sequence populates all 4096
syn/anti combinations of its four G-stretches. The simulations can propose
idealized folding pathways but we explain that such few-state pathways may be
misleading. In the context of the available experimental data, the simulations
strongly suggest that the GQ folding could be best understood by the kinetic
partitioning mechanism with a set of deep competing minima on the folding
landscape, with only a small fraction of molecules directly folding to the
native fold. The landscape should further include nonspecific collapse
processes where the molecules move via diffusion and consecutive random rare
transitions, which could, e.g., structure the propeller loops.

functional annotation of proteins is expected to meet the conflicting
requirements of maximizing annotation coverage, while minimizing erroneous

intelligent systems to tackle the problem of automatic protein annotation. In
this work, we present a system that utilizes rule mining techniques to predict

predictive models that assign pathway involvement to UniProtKB entries. We
carried out an evaluation study of our system performance using
cross-validation technique. We found that it achieved very promising results in
pathway identification with an F1-measure of 0.982 and an AUC of 0.987. Our
prediction models were then successfully applied to 6.2 million

theoretical models of one-dimensional transport, crowding, and jamming.
Experiments studying the motion of Xklp1 motors on reconstituted antiparallel
microtubule overlaps demonstrated that motors recruited to the overlap walk
toward the plus end of individual microtubules and frequently switch between
filaments. We study a model of this system that couples the totally asymmetric
simple exclusion process (TASEP) for motor motion with switches between
antiparallel filaments and binding kinetics. We determine steady-state motor
density profiles for fixed-length overlaps using exact and approximate
solutions of the continuum differential equations and compare to kinetic Monte
Carlo simulations. Overlap motor density profiles and motor trajectories
resemble experimental measurements. The phase diagram of the model is similar
to the single-filament case for low switching rate, while for high switching
rate we find a new low density-high density-low density-high density phase. The
overlap center region, far from the overlap ends, has a constant motor density
as one would naively expect. However, rather than following a simple binding
equilibrium, the center motor density depends on total overlap length, motor
speed, and motor switching rate. The size of the crowded boundary layer near
the overlap ends is also dependent on the overlap length and switching rate in
addition to the motor speed and bulk concentration. The antiparallel
microtubule overlap geometry may offer a previously unrecognized mechanism for
biological regulation of protein concentration and consequent activity.

1509.07302	q-bio	cs.NE q-bio.NC	Mapping Generative Models onto a Network of Digital Spiking Neurons	"  Stochastic neural networks such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) have
been successfully used in applications ranging from speech recognition to image
classification. Inference and learning in these algorithms use a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo procedure called Gibbs sampling, where a logistic function forms
the kernel of this sampler. On the other side of the spectrum, neuromorphic
systems have shown great promise for low-power and parallelized cognitive
computing, but lack well-suited applications and automation procedures. In this
work, we propose a systematic method for bridging the RBM algorithm and digital
neuromorphic systems, with a generative pattern completion task as proof of
concept. For this, we first propose a method of producing the Gibbs sampler
using bio-inspired digital noisy integrate-and-fire neurons. Next, we describe
the process of mapping generative RBMs trained offline onto the IBM TrueNorth
neurosynaptic processor -- a low-power digital neuromorphic VLSI substrate.
Mapping these algorithms onto neuromorphic hardware presents unique challenges
in network connectivity and weight and bias quantization, which, in turn,
require architectural and design strategies for the physical realization.
Generative performance metrics are analyzed to validate the neuromorphic
requirements and to best select the neuron parameters for the model. Lastly, we

  heterogeneous genomic data"	"  Motivation: We introduce TRONCO (TRanslational ONCOlogy), an open-source R
package that implements the state-of-the-art algorithms for the inference of
cancer progression models from (epi)genomic mutational profiles. TRONCO can be
used to extract population-level models describing the trends of accumulation
of alterations in a cohort of cross-sectional samples, e.g., retrieved from
publicly available databases, and individual-level models that reveal the
clonal evolutionary history in single cancer patients, when multiple samples,
e.g., multiple biopsies or single-cell sequencing data, are available. The
resulting models can provide key hints in uncovering the evolutionary
trajectories of cancer, especially for precision medicine or personalized
therapy.

1509.07420	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio.MN	"Role of DNA binding sites and slow unbinding kinetics in titration-based
  oscillators"	"  Genetic oscillators, such as circadian clocks, are constantly perturbed by
molecular noise arising from the small number of molecules involved in gene
regulation. One of the strongest sources of stochasticity is the binary noise
that arises from the binding of a regulatory protein to a promoter in the
chromosomal DNA. In this study, we focus on two minimal oscillators based on
activator titration and repressor titration to understand the key parameters
that are important for oscillations and for overcoming binary noise. We show
that the rate of unbinding from the DNA, despite traditionally being considered
a fast parameter, needs to be slow to broaden the space of oscillatory
solutions. The addition of multiple, independent DNA binding sites further
expands the oscillatory parameter space for the repressor-titration oscillator
and lengthens the period of both oscillators. This effect is a combination of
increased effective delay of the unbinding kinetics due to multiple binding
sites and increased promoter ultrasensitivity that is specific for repression.
We then use stochastic simulation to show that multiple binding sites increase
the coherence of the oscillations by mitigating the binary noise. Slow values
of DNA unbinding rate are also effective in alleviating molecular noise due to
the increased distance from the bifurcation point. Our work demonstrates how
DNA binding sites and slow unbinding kinetics, which are often omitted in
biophysical models of gene circuits, can have a significant impact on the
temporal and stochastic dynamics of genetic oscillators.

  processes"	"  Effort has been given for the development of an analytical approach that
helps to address several sigmoidal and non-sigmoidal growth processes found in
literature. In the proposed approach, the role of specific growth rate in
different growth processes has been considered in an unified manner. It is
found that the different growth equations can be derived from the same
functional form of rate equation of specific growth rate. A common functional
form of growth and growth velocity have been derived analytically and it has
been shown that different values of the parameters involved in the description
lead to different growth function. The theta logistic growth can be explained
in this proposed framework. It is found that the competitive environment may
increase the saturation level of population size.

1509.07786	q-bio	q-bio.SC q-bio.TO	"CYP3A Mediated Ketamine Metabolism is Severely Impaired in Liver S9
  Fractions from Aging Sprague Dawley Rats"	"  Ketamine is widely used in veterinary medicine and in medicine. Ketamine is
metabolized to its active metabolite norketamine principally by liver CYP3A.
Drug metabolism alterations during aging have severe consequences particularly
in anesthesiology and very few studies on older animals were conducted for
ketamine. The objective of the present study is to assess the influence of
aging on CYP3A metabolism of ketamine. Liver S9 fractions from 3, 6, 12 and 18
month old male Sprague Dawley rats were prepared and Michaelis-Menten
parameters were determined for primary metabolic pathways. The derived maximum
enzyme velocity (i.e. Vmax) suggests a rapid saturation of the CYP3A enzyme
active sites in liver S9 fractions of 18-month old rats. Observed Vmax for
Liver S9 fractions from 3, 6 and 12 month old male Sprague Dawley rats were
2.39 (+-0.23), 2.61 (+-0.18), and 2.07 (+-0.07) respectively compared to 0.68
(+-0.02) for Liver S9 fractions from 18 month old male Sprague Dawley rats.
Interestingly, we observed a 6 to 7 fold change in the derived Km when
comparing Liver S9 fractions from 18 month old male Sprague Dawley rats with
Liver S9 fractions from younger rats. Our results suggest that rat CYP3A enzyme
undergoes conformational changes with age particularly in our geriatric group
(e.g. 18 month rats) leading significant decrease in the rate of formation of
norketamine. Moreover, our results strongly suggest a severe impairment of
CYP3A ketamine mediated metabolism.

This framework is applied to flagellar synchronization by hydrodynamic

generating process may change over time or across domains. The nonstationarity
presents both challenges and opportunities for causal discovery. In this paper
we propose a principled framework to handle nonstationarity, and develop some
methods to address three important questions. First, we propose an enhanced
constraint-based method to detect variables whose local mechanisms are
nonstationary and recover the skeleton of the causal structure over observed
variables. Second, we present a way to determine some causal directions by
taking advantage of information carried by changing distributions. Third, we
develop a method for visualizing the nonstationarity of causal modules.
Experimental results on various synthetic and real-world data sets are
presented to demonstrate the efficacy of our methods.

elegant explanation for this: ornaments signal individual quality, and must be

observation of bimodally distributed ornament sizes in a variety of species.

1509.08409	q-bio	q-bio.MN cs.SY math.OC	Control of complex networks requires both structure and dynamics	"  The study of network structure has uncovered signatures of the organization
of complex systems. However, there is also a need to understand how to control
them; for example, identifying strategies to revert a diseased cell to a
healthy state, or a mature cell to a pluripotent state. Two recent
methodologies suggest that the controllability of complex systems can be
predicted solely from the graph of interactions between variables, without
considering their dynamics: structural controllability and minimum dominating
sets. We demonstrate that such structure-only methods fail to characterize
controllability when dynamics are introduced. We study Boolean network
ensembles of network motifs as well as three models of biochemical regulation:
the segment polarity network in Drosophila melanogaster, the cell cycle of
budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the floral organ arrangement in
Arabidopsis thaliana. We demonstrate that structure-only methods both
undershoot and overshoot the number and which sets of critical variables best
control the dynamics of these models, highlighting the importance of the actual
system dynamics in determining control. Our analysis further shows that the
logic of automata transition functions, namely how canalizing they are, plays
an important role in the extent to which structure predicts dynamics.

1509.08573	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio.TO	Entropy Production and the Pressure-Volume Curve of the Lung	"  We investigate analytically the production of entropy during a breathing
cycle in healthy and diseased lungs. First, we calculate entropy production in
healthy lungs by applying the laws of thermodynamics to the well-known
transpulmonary pressure-volume ($P-V$) curves of the lung under the assumption
that lung tissue behaves as an entropy spring-like rubber. The bulk modulus,
$B$, of the lung is also derived from these calculations. Second, we extend
this approach to elastic recoil disorders of the lung such as occur in
pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema. These diseases are characterized by
particular alterations in the $P-V$ relationship. For example, in fibrotic
lungs $B$ increases monotonically with disease progression, while in emphysema
the opposite occurs. These diseases can thus be mimicked simply by making
appropriate adjustments to the parameters of the $P-V$ curve. Using Clausius's
formalism, we show that entropy production, $\Delta S$, is related to the
hysteresis area, $\Delta A$, enclosed by the $P-V$ curve during a breathing
cycle, namely, $\Delta S=\Delta A/T$, where $T$ is the body temperature.
Although $\Delta A$ is highly dependent on the disease, such formula applies to
healthy as well as diseased lungs, regardless of the disease stage. Finally, we
use {\it ansatzs} to predict analytically the entropy produced by the fibrotic
and emphysematous lungs.

expressed through the mediation of their dynamics. Local fluctuations are known
to initiate biologically relevant pathways as they cooperatively enhance the
dynamics in specific regions in the protein. Those biologically active regions
provide energetically-comparable conformational states that can be trapped by a
reacting partner. We analyze this mechanism as we calculate the dynamics of
monomeric and dimerized HIV protease, and free Insulin Growth Factor II
Receptor (IGF2R) domain 11 and its IGF2R:IGF2 complex. We adopt a newly
developed coarse-grained model, the Langevin Equation for Protein Dynamics
(LE4PD), which predicts dynamical relevant mechanisms with high accuracy. Both
simulation-derived and experimental NMR conformers are the input structural
ensembles for the LE4PD. The use of the experimental NMR conformers requires
minimal computational resources.

  V1 model"	"  Activity in the brain propagates as waves of firing neurons, namely
avalanches. These waves' size and duration distributions have been
experimentally shown to display a stable power-law profile, long-range
correlations and $1/f^{b}$ power spectrum \textit{in vivo} and \textit{in
vitro}. We study an avalanching biologically motivated model of mammals visual
cortex and find an extended critical-like region -- a Griffiths phase --
characterized by divergent susceptibility and zero order parameter. This phase
lies close to the expected experimental value of the \textit{excitatory
postsynaptic potential} in the cortex suggesting that critical behavior may be
found in the visual system. Avalanches are not perfectly power-law distributed,
but it is possible to collapse the distributions and define a cutoff avalanche
size that diverges as the network size is increased inside the critical region.
The avalanches present long-range correlations and $1/f^{b}$ power spectrum,
matching experiments. The phase transition is analytically determined by a
mean-field approximation.

its implications on geospatial drought assessment were demonstrated. An index
of Cropping Pattern Dissimilarity (CP-DI) between a pair of years, developed in
this study, proved that the cropping pattern of a year has a higher degree of
similarity with that of recent past years only and tends to be dissimilar with
longer time difference. The temporal divergence in cropping pattern has direct
implications on geospatial approach of drought assessment, in which, time
series NDVI data are compared for drought interpretation. It was found that,
seasonal NDVI profiles of drought year and normal year did not show any anomaly
when the cropping patterns were dissimilar and two normal years having
dissimilar cropping pattern showed different NDVI profiles. Therefore, it is
suggested that such temporal comparisons of NDVI are better restricted to
recent past years to achieve more objective interpretation.

regression with regularization has found wide adoption in biomedicine, social
sciences, information technology, and so on. These domains often involve data
of human subjects that are contingent upon strict privacy regulations.
Increasing concerns over data privacy make it more and more difficult to
coordinate and conduct large-scale collaborative studies, which typically rely
on cross-institution data sharing and joint analysis. Our work here focuses on
safeguarding regularized logistic regression, a widely-used machine learning
model in various disciplines while at the same time has not been investigated
from a data security and privacy perspective. We consider a common use scenario
of multi-institution collaborative studies, such as in the form of research
consortia or networks as widely seen in genetics, epidemiology, social
sciences, etc. To make our privacy-enhancing solution practical, we demonstrate
a non-conventional and computationally efficient method leveraging distributing
computing and strong cryptography to provide comprehensive protection over
individual-level and summary data. Extensive empirical evaluation on several
studies validated the privacy guarantees, efficiency and scalability of our
proposal. We also discuss the practical implications of our solution for
large-scale studies and applications from various disciplines, including
genetic and biomedical studies, smart grid, network analysis, etc.

were previously analyzed in complex networks. However, they have not been
extensively studied in modular networks. Here, we consider the neural network
of the \textit{C.elegans} soil worm, organized into six interconnected
communities, where neurons obey chaotic bursting dynamics. Neurons are assumed
to be connected with electrical synapses within their communities and with
chemical synapses across them. As our numerical simulations reveal, the
coaction of these two types of coupling can shape the dynamics in such a way
that chimera-like states can happen. They consist of a fraction of synchronized
neurons which belong to the larger communities, and a fraction of
desynchronized neurons which are part of smaller communities. In addition to
the Kuramoto order parameter $\rho$, we also employ other measures of
coherence, such as the chimera-like $\chi$ and metastability $\lambda$ indices,
which quantify the degree of synchronization among communities and along time,
respectively. We perform the same analysis for networks that share common
features with the \textit{C.elegans} neural network. Similar results suggest
that under certain assumptions, chimera-like states are prominent phenomena in
modular networks, and might provide insight for the behavior of more complex
modular networks.

1510.00420	q-bio	physics.bio-ph cond-mat.soft q-bio.SC	"Modeling magnetosensitive ion channels in viscoelastic environment of
  living cells"	"  We propose and study a model of hypothetical magnetosensitive ionic channels
which are long thought to be a possible candidate to explain the influence of
weak magnetic fields on living organisms ranging from magnetotactic bacteria to
fishes, birds, rats, bats and other mammals including humans. The core of the
model is provided by a short chain of magnetosomes serving as a sensor which is
coupled by elastic linkers to the gating elements of ion channels forming a
small cluster in the cell membrane. The magnetic sensor is fixed by one end on
cytoskeleton elements attached to the membrane and is exposed to viscoelastic
cytosol. Its free end can reorient stochastically and subdiffusively in
viscoelastic cytosol responding to external magnetic field changes and open the
gates of coupled ion channels. The sensor dynamics is generally bistable due to
bistability of the gates which can be in two states with probabilities which
depend on the sensor orientation. For realistic parameters, it is shown that
this model channel can operate in the magnetic field of Earth for a small
number (5 to 7) of single-domain magnetosomes constituting the sensor rod each
of which has a typical size found in magnetotactic bacteria and other
organisms, or even just one sufficiently large nanoparticle of a characteristic
size also found in nature. It is shown that due to viscoelasticity of medium
the bistable gating dynamics generally exhibits power law and stretched
exponential distributions of the residence times of the channels in their open
and closed states. This provides a generic physical mechanism for explanation
of the origin of such anomalous kinetics for other ionic channels whose sensors
move in viscoelastic environment provided by either cytosol or biological
membrane, in a quite general context, beyond the fascinating hypothesis of
magnetosensitive ionic channels we explore.

synapses [1] unlike spiking models which typically use conductance-based
synapses [2]. Although neural field models that employ conductance-based
synapses have been studied [3,9], the functional effects on the neuronal
dynamics have not been systematically analysed and compared to that of models
with current-based synapses. This shortcoming is particularly apparent with
respect to epileptic dynamics, where neural field models of epilepsy typically
describe the transition to seizure-like activity as a bifurcation [10]. This
letter examines and compares the differences between conductance-based synapses
and current-based synapses by constructing a neural field model that
encapsulates both through a homotopic mapping. The results demonstrate
significantly different non-trivial effects of these synaptic mechanisms on the
system dynamics, particularly with respect to the model's bifurcation dynamics.

on the topological construction of the directed clique complex. The shape of
the underlying directed graph is encoded in a way that can be studied
mathematically to obtain network invariants such as the Euler characteristic
and the Betti numbers. Two different cases illustrate the application of the
Euler characteristic. We investigate how the evolution of a Boolean recurrent
artificial neural network is influenced by its topology in a dynamics involving
pruning and strengthening of the connections, and to show that the topological
features of the directed clique complex influence the dynamical evolution of
the network. The second application considers the directed clique complex in a
broader framework, to define an invariant of directed networks, the network
degree invariant, which is constructed by computing the topological invariant
on a sequence of sub-networks filtered by the minimum in- or out-degree of the
nodes. The application of the Euler characteristic presented here can be
extended to any directed network and provides a new method for the assessment
of specific functional features associated with the network topology.

1510.00767	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Exploring the isotopic niche: isotopic variance, physiological
  incorporation, and the temporal dynamics of foraging"	"  Consumer foraging behaviors are dynamic, changing in response to prey
availability, seasonality, competition, and even the consumer's physiological
state. The isotopic composition of a consumer is a product of these factors as
well as the isotopic 'landscape' of its prey, i.e. the isotopic mixing space.
Here we build a mechanistic framework that links the ecological and
physiological processes of an individual consumer to the isotopic distribution
that describes its diet, and ultimately to the isotopic composition of its own
tissues, defined as its 'isotopic niche'. By coupling these processes, we
systematically investigate under what conditions the isotopic niche of a
consumer changes as a function of both the geometric properties of its mixing
space and foraging strategies that may be static or dynamic over time. Results
of our derivations reveal general insight into the conditions impacting
isotopic niche width as a function of consumer specialization on prey, as well
as the consumer's ability to transition between diets over time. We show
analytically that moderate specialization on isotopically unique prey can serve
to maximize a consumer's isotopic niche width, while temporally dynamic diets
will tend to result in peak isotopic variance during dietary transitions. We
demonstrate the relevance of our theoretical findings by examining a marine
system composed of nine invertebrate species commonly consumed by sea otters.
In general, our analytical framework highlights the complex interplay of mixing
space geometry and consumer dietary behavior in driving expansion and
contraction of the isotopic niche. Because this approach is established on
ecological mechanism, it is well-suited for enhancing the ecological
interpretation, and uncovering the root causes, of observed isotopic data.

  phylodynamic inference"	"  Phylodynamics seeks to estimate effective population size fluctuations from
molecular sequences of individuals sampled from a population of interest. One
way to accomplish this task formulates an observed sequence data likelihood
exploiting a coalescent model for the sampled individuals' genealogy and then
integrating over all possible genealogies via Monte Carlo or, less efficiently,
by conditioning on one genealogy estimated from the sequence data. However,
when analyzing sequences sampled serially through time, current methods
implicitly assume either that sampling times are fixed deterministically by the
data collection protocol or that their distribution does not depend on the size
of the population. Through simulation, we first show that, when sampling times
do probabilistically depend on effective population size, estimation methods
may be systematically biased. To correct for this deficiency, we propose a new
model that explicitly accounts for preferential sampling by modeling the
sampling times as an inhomogeneous Poisson process dependent on effective
population size. We demonstrate that in the presence of preferential sampling
our new model not only reduces bias, but also improves estimation precision.
Finally, we compare the performance of the currently used phylodynamic methods
with our proposed model through clinically-relevant, seasonal human influenza
examples.

1510.00840	q-bio	math.DS q-bio.PE	Population models with partial migration	"  Populations exhibiting partial migration consist of two groups of
individuals: Those that mi- grate between habitats, and those that remain fixed
in a single habitat. We propose several discrete-time population models to
investigate the coexistence of migrants and residents. The first class of
models is linear, and we distinguish two scenarios. In the first, there is a
single egg pool to which both populations contribute. A fraction of the eggs is
destined to become migrants, and the remainder become residents. In a second
model, there are two distinct egg pools to which the two types contribute, one
corresponding to residents and another to migrants. The asymptotic growth or
decline in these models can be phrased in terms of the value of the basic
reproduction number being larger or less than one respectively. A second class
of models incorporates density dependence effects. It is assumed that increased
densities in the various life history stages adversely affect the success of
transitioning of individuals to subsequent stages. Here too we consider models
with one or two egg pools. Although these are nonlinear models, their
asymptotic dynamics can still be classified in terms of the value of a locally
defined basic reproduction number: If it is less than one, then the entire
population goes extinct, whereas it settles at a unique fixed point consisting
of a mixture of residents and migrants, when it is larger than one. Thus, the
value of the basic reproduction number can be used to predict the stable
coexistence or collapse of populations exhibiting partial migration.

approximately-determined episodes of hyperbolic growth: 10,000-500 BC, AD
500-1200 and AD 1400-1950, representing a total of about 89% of the past 12,000

1200-1400 and AD 1950-present, representing the remaining 11% of the past
12,000 years. The first two transitions were between sustained hyperbolic
trajectories. The current transition is to an unknown trajectory. There was
never any form of dramatic transition from stagnation to growth, described
often as a takeoff, because there was no stagnation in the growth of the world
population. Correct understanding of the historical growth of human population

  Analysis of Instagram User Timelines"	"  Much recent research aims to identify evidence for Drug-Drug Interactions

literature. In addition to this ""Bibliome"", the universe of social media
provides a very promising source of large-scale data that can help identify DDI
and ADR in ways that have not been hitherto possible. Given the large number of
users, analysis of social media data may be useful to identify under-reported,
population-level pathology associated with DDI, thus further contributing to
improvements in population health. Moreover, tapping into this data allows us
to infer drug interactions with natural products--including cannabis--which
constitute an array of DDI very poorly explored by biomedical research thus
far. Our goal is to determine the potential of Instagram for public health
monitoring and surveillance for DDI, ADR, and behavioral pathology at large.
Using drug, symptom, and natural product dictionaries for identification of the
various types of DDI and ADR evidence, we have collected ~7000 timelines. We
report on 1) the development of a monitoring tool to easily observe user-level
timelines associated with drug and symptom terms of interest, and 2)
population-level behavior via the analysis of co-occurrence networks computed
from user timelines at three different scales: monthly, weekly, and daily
occurrences. Analysis of these networks further reveals 3) drug and symptom
direct and indirect associations with greater support in user timelines, as
well as 4) clusters of symptoms and drugs revealed by the collective behavior
of the observed population. This demonstrates that Instagram contains much
drug- and pathology specific data for public health monitoring of DDI and ADR,
and that complex network analysis provides an important toolbox to extract
health-related associations and their support from large-scale social media
data.

MHb activates IPN,and IPN stimulates MRN and its serotonin release. Proposed
idea is that this MHb-IPN-MRN circuit promotes slow wave sleep (SWS), high
serotonin and low acetylcholine state. My prediction is that this SWS-promoting
circuit reciprocally suppresses the theta oscillations promoting circuit,
linked to high acetylcholine levels in brain, and formed by supramamillary area
projections to the medial septum (MS) that induces theta rhythm in hippocampus
and other theta-coupled regions. The MHb-IPN-MRN pathway likely inhibits,
possibly reciprocally,some regions that have stimulating input to the
theta-generating SUM and MS, such as the wake promoting nucleus incertus,
posterior and lateral hypothalamus and LDT, but also the REM sleep inducing
neurons in LDT and PnO. Thus, proposed SWS- promoting circuit attenuates the
output of theta-promoting regions, both the active wake-on and REM-on regions.
The theta rhythm in wake state is linked to recording and binding information
with their spatio-temporal and relational context by hippocampus, while the SWS
supports rest and replay of hippocampaly stored information and their cortical
reactivations, e. g. in retrosplenial cortex linked to autobiographic memory or
in prefrontal cortex that can combine information from any source.

  seasonal influenza viruses"	"  Human seasonal influenza viruses evolve rapidly, enabling the virus
population to evade immunity and re-infect previously infected individuals.
Antigenic properties are largely determined by the surface glycoprotein
hemagglutinin (HA) and amino acid substitutions at exposed epitope sites in HA
mediate loss of recognition by antibodies. Here, we show that antigenic
differences measured through serological assay data are well described by a sum
of antigenic changes along the path connecting viruses in a phylogenetic tree.
This mapping onto the tree allows prediction of antigenicity from HA sequence
data alone. The mapping can further be used to make predictions about the
makeup of the future seasonal influenza virus population, and we compare
predictions between models with serological and sequence data. To make timely
model output readily available, we developed a web browser based application
that visualizes antigenic data on a continuously updated phylogeny.

1510.01420	q-bio	q-bio.BM	3D RNA and functional interactions from evolutionary couplings	"  Non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous, but the discovery of new RNA gene sequences
far outpaces research on their structure and functional interactions. We mine
the evolutionary sequence record to derive precise information about function
and structure of RNAs and RNA-protein complexes. As in protein structure
prediction, we use maximum entropy global probability models of sequence
co-variation to infer evolutionarily constrained nucleotide-nucleotide
interactions within RNA molecules, and nucleotide-amino acid interactions in
RNA-protein complexes. The predicted contacts allow all-atom blinded 3D
structure prediction at good accuracy for several known RNA structures and
RNA-protein complexes. For unknown structures, we predict contacts in 160
non-coding RNA families. Beyond 3D structure prediction, evolutionary couplings
help identify important functional interactions, e.g., at switch points in
riboswitches and at a complex nucleation site in HIV. Aided by accelerating
sequence accumulation, evolutionary coupling analysis can accelerate the
discovery of functional interactions and 3D structures involving RNA.

effects which, in turn, impose wide-ranging negative constraints on emotional
well being and neurocognitive performance (Kalueff:2007cp, Charles:2013eq,
Nadler:2010hk). Crucial cognitive functions such as memory and problem solving,
as well more short term emotional responses (e.g., anticipation of- and
response to- monetary rewards or losses) are influenced by mood. The negative
impact of these behavioural responses is felt at the individual level, but it
also imposes major economic burden on modern healthcare systems. Although much
research have been undertaken to understand the underlying mechanisms of
depressed mood and design efficient treatment pathways, comparatively little
was done to characterize mood modulations that remain within the boundaries of
a healthy mental functioning. In one placebo-controlled experiments, we applied
daily prefrontal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) at five points
in time, and found reliable improvements on self-reported mood evaluation. We
replicated this finding in an independent double-blinded placebo-controlled
experiment and showed that stimulation over a shorter period of time (3 days)
is sufficient to create detectable mood improvements. Taken together, our data
show that repeated bilateral prefrontal tDCS can reduce psychological distress
in nondepressed individuals.

depend on network structure and synaptic parameter. We identify four different
avalanche profiles as a function of the excitatory postsynaptic potential. The
avalanches follow a size-duration scaling relation and present critical

1510.02356	q-bio	q-bio.PE q-bio.GN	Clustering genes of common evolutionary history	"  Phylogenetic inference can potentially result in a more accurate tree using
data from multiple loci. However, if the loci are incongruent--due to events
such as incomplete lineage sorting or horizontal gene transfer--it can be
misleading to infer a single tree. To address this, many previous contributions
have taken a mechanistic approach, by modelling specific processes.
Alternatively, one can cluster loci without assuming how these incongruencies
might arise. Such ""process-agnostic"" approaches typically infer a tree for each
locus and cluster these. There are, however, many possible combinations of tree
distance and clustering methods; their comparative performance in the context
of tree incongruence is largely unknown. Furthermore, because standard model
selection criteria such as AIC cannot be applied to problems with a variable
number of topologies, the issue of inferring the optimal number of clusters is
poorly understood. Here, we perform a large-scale simulation study of
phylogenetic distances and clustering methods to infer loci of common
evolutionary history. We observe that the best-performing combinations are
distances accounting for branch lengths followed by spectral clustering or
Ward's method. We also introduce two statistical tests to infer the optimal
number of clusters and show that they strongly outperform the silhouette
criterion, a general-purpose heuristic. We illustrate the usefulness of the
approach by (i) identifying errors in a previous phylogenetic analysis of yeast
species and (ii) identifying topological incongruence among newly sequenced
loci of the globeflower fly genus Chiastocheta. We release treeCl, a new
program to cluster genes of common evolutionary history (http://git.io/treeCl).

sequences may not seem compatible with the B-DNA structure because the sequence
information is hidden when it is used for joining the two strands.
Nevertheless, it has to be invoked to account for various biological data.
Using quantum chemistry, molecular mechanics, and hints from recent genetics
experiments I show here that direct recognition between homologous dsDNA is
possible through formation of short quadruplexes due to direct complementary
hydrogen bonding of major groove surfaces in parallel alignment. The
constraints imposed by the predicted structures of the recognition units
determine the mechanism of complexation between long dsDNA. This mechanism and
concomitant predictions agree with available experimental data and shed light
upon the sequence effects and the possible involvement of topoisomerase II in
the recognition.

the hereditary information underlying life to an `aperiodic crystal'. We
compare and contrast this, only later discovered to be stored in the linear
biomolecule DNA, with the information bearing, layered quasi-one-dimensional
materials investigated by the emerging field of chaotic crystallography.
Despite differences in functionality, the same information measures capture
structure and novelty in both, suggesting an intimate coherence between the
information character of biotic and abiotic matter---a broadly applicable
physics of information. We review layered solids and consider three examples of
how information- and computation-theoretic techniques are being applied to
understand their structure. In particular, (i) we review recent efforts to
apply new kinds of information measures to quantify disordered crystals; (ii)
we discuss the structure of ice I in information-theoretic terms; and (iii) we
recount recent experimental results on tris(bicyclo[2.1.1]hexeno)benzene TBHB),
showing how an information-theoretic analysis yields additional insight into
its structure. We then illustrate a new Second Law of Thermodynamics that
describes information processing in active low-dimensional materials, reviewing
Maxwell's Demon and a new class of molecular devices that act as information
catalysts. Lastly, we conclude by speculating on how these ideas from
informational materials science may impact biology.

1510.02863	q-bio	stat.AP q-bio.GN	The dissection of expression quantitative trait locus hotspots	"  Studies of the genetic loci that contribute to variation in gene expression
frequently identify loci with broad effect on gene expression: expression
quantitative trait locus (eQTL) hotspots. We describe a set of exploratory
graphical methods as well as a formal likelihood-based test for assessing
whether a given hotspot is due to one or multiple polymorphisms. We first look
at the pattern of effects of the locus on the expression traits that map to the
locus: the direction of the effects, as well as the degree of dominance. A
second technique is to focus on the individuals that exhibit no recombination
event in the region, apply dimensionality reduction (such as with linear
discriminant analysis) and compare the phenotype distribution in the
non-recombinants to that in the recombinant individuals: If the recombinant
individuals display a different expression pattern than the non-recombinants,
this indicates the presence of multiple causal polymorphisms. In the formal
likelihood-based test, we compare a two-locus model, with each expression trait
affected by one or the other locus, to a single-locus model. We apply our
methods to a large mouse intercross with gene expression microarray data on six
tissues.

  zipping"	"  Renaturation of complementary single strands of DNA is one of the important
processes that requires better understanding in the view of molecular biology
and biological physics. Here we develop a stochastic dynamical model on the DNA
renaturation. According to our model there are at least three steps in the
renaturation process viz. incorrect-contact formation, correct-contact
formation and nucleation, and zipping. Most of the earlier two-state models
combined nucleation with incorrect-contact formation step. In our model we
suggest that it is considerably meaningful when we combine the nucleation with
the zipping since nucleation is the initial step of zipping and the nucleated
and zipping molecules are indistinguishable. Incorrect-contact formation step
is a pure three-dimensional diffusion controlled collision process. Whereas
nucleation involves several rounds of one-dimensional slithering dynamics of
one single strand of DNA on the other complementary strand in the process of
searching for the correct-contact and then initiate nucleation. Upon
nucleation, the stochastic zipping follows to generate a fully renatured double
stranded DNA. It seems that the square-root dependency of the overall
renaturation rate constant on the length of reacting single strands originates
mainly from the geometric constraints in the diffusion controlled
incorrect-contact formation step. Further the inverse scaling of the
renaturation rate on the viscosity of the reaction medium also originates from
the incorrect-contact formation step. On the other hand the inverse scaling of
the renaturation rate with the sequence complexity originates from the
stochastic zipping which involves several rounds of crossing over the
free-energy barrier at microscopic levels.

measuring stationary and non-stationary spectral phenomena and in describing
pairwise relationships among multiple signals. Although a variety of WFDs see
frequent application in electrophysiological research, including the short-time
Fourier transform, continuous wavelets, band-pass filtering and
multitaper-based approaches, each carries certain drawbacks related to
computational efficiency and spectral leakage. This work surveys the advantages
of a WFD not previously applied in electrophysiological settings.
  New Methods: A computationally efficient form of complex demodulation, the
demodulated band transform (DBT), is described.
  Results: DBT is shown to provide an efficient approach to spectral estimation
with minimal susceptibility to spectral leakage. In addition, it lends itself
well to adaptive filtering of non-stationary narrowband noise.
  Comparison with existing methods: A detailed comparison with alternative WFDs
is offered, with an emphasis on the relationship between DBT and Thomson's
multitaper. DBT is shown to perform favorably in combining computational
efficiency with minimal introduction of spectral leakage.
  Conclusion: DBT is ideally suited to efficient estimation of both stationary
and non-stationary spectral and cross-spectral statistics with minimal
susceptibility to spectral leakage. These qualities are broadly desirable in
many settings.

1510.03172	q-bio	q-bio.QM q-bio.MN	Model reduction for stochastic chemical systems with abundant species	"  Biochemical processes typically involve many chemical species, some in
abundance and some in low molecule numbers. Here we first identify the rate
constant limits under which the concentrations of a given set of species will
tend to infinity (the abundant species) while the concentrations of all other
species remains constant (the non-abundant species). Subsequently we prove that
in this limit, the fluctuations in the molecule numbers of non-abundant species
are accurately described by a hybrid stochastic description consisting of a
chemical master equation coupled to deterministic rate equations. This is a
reduced description when compared to the conventional chemical master equation
which describes the fluctuations in both abundant and non-abundant species. We
show that the reduced master equation can be solved exactly for a number of
biochemical networks involving gene expression and enzyme catalysis, whose
conventional chemical master equation description is analytically impenetrable.
We use the linear noise approximation to obtain approximate expressions for the
difference between the variance of fluctuations in the non-abundant species as
predicted by the hybrid approach and by the conventional chemical master
equation. Furthermore we show that surprisingly, irrespective of any separation
in the mean molecule numbers of various species, the conventional and hybrid
master equations exactly agree for a class of chemical systems.

locking, as seen in {\it Chlamydomonas}, and metachronal wave formation in the
respiratory cilia of higher organisms. Since the observations by Gray and
Rothschild of phase synchrony of nearby swimming spermatozoa, it has been a
working hypothesis that synchrony arises from hydrodynamic interactions between
beating filaments. Recent work on the dynamics of physically separated pairs of
flagella isolated from the multicellular alga {\it Volvox} has shown that
hydrodynamic coupling alone is sufficient to produce synchrony. However, the
situation is more complex in unicellular organisms bearing few flagella. We
show that flagella of {\it Chlamydomonas} mutants deficient in filamentary
connections between basal bodies display markedly different synchronization
from the wild type. We perform micromanipulation on configurations of flagella
and conclude that a mechanism, internal to the cell, must provide an additional
flagellar coupling. In naturally occurring species with 4, 8, or even 16
flagella, we find diverse symmetries of basal body positioning and of the
flagellar apparatus that are coincident with specific gaits of flagellar
actuation, suggesting that it is a competition between intracellular coupling
and hydrodynamic interactions that ultimately determines the precise form of
flagellar coordination in unicellular algae.

and solar proton events have been recognized as a potential threat to life on
Earth, primarily through depletion of stratospheric ozone and subsequent
increase in solar UV radiation at Earth's surface and in the upper levels of
the ocean. Other work has also considered the potential impact of nitric acid
rainout, concluding that no significant threat is likely. Not yet studied
to-date is the potential impact of ozone produced in the lower atmosphere
following an ionizing radiation event. Ozone is a known irritant to organisms
on land and in water and therefore may be a significant additional hazard.
Using previously completed atmospheric chemistry modeling we have examined the
amount of ozone produced in the lower atmosphere for the case of a gamma-ray
burst and find that the values are too small to pose a significant additional
threat to the biosphere. These results may be extended to other ionizing

targeting abilities have received enormous attention for biomedical
applications. Here, we describe a novel enzyme-based cap system for mesoporous
silica nanoparticles (MSNs) that is directly combined with a targeting ligand
via bio-orthogonal click chemistry. The capping system is based on the
pH-responsive binding of an aryl-sulfonamide-functionalized MSN and the enzyme
carbonic anhydrase (CA). An unnatural amino acid (UAA) containing a norbornene
moiety was genetically incorporated into CA. This UAA allowed for the
site-specific bio-orthogonal attachment of even very sensitive targeting
ligands such as folic acid and anandamide. This leads to specific
receptor-mediated cell and stem cell uptake. We demonstrate the successful
delivery and release of the chemotherapeutic agent Actinomycin D to KB cells.
This novel nanocarrier concept provides a promising platform for the
development of precisely controllable and highly modular theranostic systems.

  minimalistic model of stochastic protein assembly"	"  Self-assembly of proteins into amyloid aggregates is an important biological
phenomenon associated with human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid
fibrils also have potential applications in nano-engineering of biomaterials.
The kinetics of amyloid assembly show an exponential growth phase preceded by a
lag phase, variable in duration as seen in bulk experiments and experiments
that mimic the small volumes of cells. Here, to investigate the origins and the
properties of the observed variability in the lag phase of amyloid assembly
currently not accounted for by deterministic nucleation dependent mechanisms,
we formulate a new stochastic minimal model that is capable of describing the
characteristics of amyloid growth curves despite its simplicity. We then solve
the stochastic differential equations of our model and give mathematical proof
of a central limit theorem for the sample growth trajectories of the nucleated
aggregation process. These results give an asymptotic description for our
simple model, from which closed form analytical results capable of describing
and predicting the variability of nucleated amyloid assembly were derived. We
also demonstrate the application of our results to inform experiments in a
conceptually friendly and clear fashion. Our model offers a new perspective and
paves the way for a new and efficient approach on extracting vital information
regarding the key initial events of amyloid formation.

structures, researchers analyzed their cores and reported packing fractions
$\phi \approx 0.75$, a value that is similar to close packing equal-sized
spheres. A limitation of these analyses was the use of `extended atom' models,
rather than the more physically accurate `explicit hydrogen' model. The
validity of using the explicit hydrogen model is proved by its ability to
predict the side chain dihedral angle distributions observed in proteins. We
employ the explicit hydrogen model to calculate the packing fraction of the
cores of over $200$ high resolution protein structures. We find that these
protein cores have $\phi \approx 0.55$, which is comparable to random
close-packing of non-spherical particles. This result provides a deeper
understanding of the physical basis of protein structure that will enable
predictions of the effects of amino acid mutations and design of new functional

interactions in a stochastic dynamical system based on information geometry. In
the proposed framework, the degree of interactions is quantified by the
divergence between the actual probability distribution of the system and a
constrained probability distribution where the interactions of interest are
disconnected. This framework provides novel geometric interpretations of
various information theoretic measures of interactions, such as mutual
information, transfer entropy, and stochastic interaction in terms of how
interactions are disconnected. The framework therefore provides an intuitive
understanding of the relationships between the various quantities. By extending
the concept of transfer entropy, we propose a novel measure of integrated
information which measures causal interactions between parts of a system.
Integrated information quantifies the extent to which the whole is more than
the sum of the parts and can be potentially used as a biological measure of the
levels of consciousness.

  Complex Tissues"	"  Identifying concentrations of components from an observed mixture is a
fundamental problem in signal processing. It has diverse applications in fields
ranging from hyperspectral imaging to denoising biomedical sensors. This paper
focuses on in-silico deconvolution of signals associated with complex tissues
into their constitutive cell-type specific components, along with a
quantitative characterization of the cell-types. Deconvolving mixed
tissues/cell-types is useful in the removal of contaminants (e.g., surrounding
cells) from tumor biopsies, as well as in monitoring changes in the cell
population in response to treatment or infection. In these contexts, the
observed signal from the mixture of cell-types is assumed to be a linear
combination of the expression levels of genes in constitutive cell-types. The
goal is to use known signals corresponding to individual cell-types along with
a model of the mixing process to cast the deconvolution problem as a suitable
optimization problem.
  In this paper, we present a survey of models, methods, and assumptions
underlying deconvolution techniques. We investigate the choice of the different
loss functions for evaluating estimation error, constraints on solutions,
preprocessing and data filtering, feature selection, and regularization to
enhance the quality of solutions, along with the impact of these choices on the
performance of regression-based methods for deconvolution. We assess different
combinations of these factors and use detailed statistical measures to evaluate
their effectiveness. We identify shortcomings of current methods and avenues
for further investigation. For many of the identified shortcomings, such as
normalization issues and data filtering, we provide new solutions. We summarize
our findings in a prescriptive step-by-step process, which can be applied to a
wide range of deconvolution problems.

These are beautiful examples of emergent dynamics in biology, and are essential
for life, allowing diverse processes from the motility of eukaryotic
microorganisms, to nutrient transport and clearance of pathogens from mammalian
airways. How these collective states arise is not fully understood, but it is
clear that individual cilia interact mechanically,and that a strong and long

here the work by ourselves and others aimed at understanding the behavior of
hydrodynamically coupled systems, and particularly a set of results that have
been obtained both experimentally and theoretically by studying actively driven
colloidal systems. In these controlled scenarios, it is possible to selectively
test aspects of the living motile cilia, such as the geometrical arrangement,
the effects of the driving profile and the distance to no-slip boundaries. We
outline and give examples of how it is possible to link model systems to
observations on living systems, which can be made on microorganisms, on cell
cultures or on tissue sections. This area of research has clear clinical
application in the long term, as severe pathologies are associated with

biological settings, we present an extension to a thorough analysis of the
stochastic self-assembly of a fixed number of identical particles in a finite
volume. We study the statistic of times it requires for maximal clusters to be
completed, starting from a pure-monomeric particle configuration. For finite
volume, we extend previous analytical approaches to the case of arbitrary
size-dependent aggregation and fragmentation kinetic rates. For larger volume,
we develop a scaling framework to study the behavior of the first assembly time
as a function of the total quantity of particles.
  We find that the mean time to first completion of a maximum-sized cluster may
have surprisingly a very weak dependency on the total number of particles. We
highlight how the higher statistic (variance, distribution) of the first
passage time may still help to infer key parameters (such as the size of the
maximum cluster) from data. And last but not least, we present a framework to
quantify the formation of cluster of macroscopic size, whose formation is
(asymptotically) very unlikely and occurs as a large deviation phenomenon from
the mean-field limit. We argue that this framework is suitable to describe
phase transition phenomena, as inherent infrequent stochastic processes, in
contrast to classical nucleation theory.

models. Here we propose a new reverse problem, which aims to identify the
stochastically spatial spread process itself from observable information
regarding the arrival history of infectious cases in each subpopulation. We
solved the problem by developing an efficient optimization algorithm based on
dynamical programming, which comprises three procedures: i, anatomizing the
whole spread process among all subpopulations into disjoint componential
patches; ii, inferring the most probable invasion pathways underlying each
patch via maximum likelihood estimation; iii, recovering the whole process by
assembling the invasion pathways in each patch iteratively, without burdens in
parameter calibrations and computer simulations. Based on the entropy theory,
we introduced an identifiability measure to assess the difficulty level that an
invasion pathway can be identified. Results on both artificial and empirical
metapopulation networks show the robust performance in identifying actual
invasion pathways driving pandemic spread.

biological and artificial networks. Yet, how such systems may specifically
communicate and dynamically route information is not well understood. Here we
identify a generic mechanism to route information on top of collective
dynamical reference states in complex networks. Switching between collective
dynamics induces flexible reorganization of information sharing and routing
patterns, as quantified by delayed mutual information and transfer entropy
measures between activities of a network's units. We demonstrate the power of
this generic mechanism specifically for oscillatory dynamics and analyze how
individual unit properties, the network topology and external inputs coact to
systematically organize information routing. For multi-scale, modular
architectures, we resolve routing patterns at all levels. Interestingly, local
interventions within one sub-network may remotely determine non-local
network-wide communication. These results help understanding and designing
information routing patterns across systems where collective dynamics co-occurs

worldwide threats for apiculture. Varroa destructor attacks the honey bee Apis
mellifera weakening its host by sucking hemolymph. However, the damage to bee
colonies is not strictly related to the parasitic action of the mite but it
derives, above all, from its action as vector increasing the trasmission of
many viral diseases such as acute paralysis (ABPV) and deformed wing viruses
(DWV), that are considered among the main causes of CCD (Colony Collapse
Disorder). In this work we discuss an SI model that describes how the presence
of the mite affects the epidemiology of these viruses on adult bees. We
characterize the system behavior, establishing that ultimately either only
healthy bees survive, or the disease becomes endemic and mites are wiped out.
Another dangerous alternative is the Varroa invasion scenario with the
extinction of healthy bees. The final possible configuration is the coexistence
equilibrium in which honey bees share their infected hive with mites. The
analysis is in line with some observed facts in natural honey bee colonies.
Namely, these diseases are endemic. Further, if the mite population is present,
necessarily the viral infection occurs. The findings of this study indicate
that a low horizontal transmission rate of the virus among honey bees in
beehives will help in protecting bee colonies from Varroa infestation and viral
epidemics.

  models"	"  In this paper, we develop a statistical methodology applied to the
characterization of flowering curves using Gaussian mixture models. Our study
relies on a set of rosebushes flowering data, and Gaussian mixture models are
mainly used to quantify the reblooming properties of each one. In this regard,
we also suggest our own selection criterion to take into account the lack of
symmetry of most of the flowering curves. Three classes are created on the
basis of a principal component analysis conducted on a set of reblooming
indicators, and a subclassification is made using a longitudinal $k$--means
algorithm which also highlights the role played by the precocity of the
flowering. In this way, we obtain an overview of the correlations between the
features we decided to retain on each curve. In particular, results suggest the
lack of correlation between reblooming and flowering precocity. The pertinent
indicators obtained in this study will be a first step towards the
comprehension of the environmental and genetic control of these biological
processes.

  the likelihood of community persistence"	"  Many of the observed species interactions embedded in ecological communities
are not permanent, but are characterized by temporal changes that are observed
along with abiotic and biotic variations. While work has been done describing
and quantifying these changes, little is known about their consequences for
species coexistence. Here, we investigate the extent to which changes of
species composition impacts the likelihood of persistence of the predator-prey
community in the highly seasonal Bialowieza Primeval Forest (NE Poland), and
the extent to which seasonal changes of species interactions (predator diet)
modulate the expected impact. This likelihood is estimated extending recent
developments on the study of structural stability in ecological communities. We
find that the observed species turnover strongly varies the likelihood of
community persistence between summer and winter. Importantly, we demonstrate
that the observed seasonal interaction changes minimize the variation in the
likelihood of persistence associated with species turnover across the year. We
find that these community dynamics can be explained as the coupling of
individual species to their environment by minimizing both the variation in
persistence conditions and the interaction changes between seasons. Our results
provide a homeostatic explanation for seasonal species interactions, and
suggest that monitoring the association of interactions changes with the level
of variation in community dynamics can provide a good indicator of the response
of species to environmental pressures.

1510.05631	q-bio	q-bio.PE math.PR	The site frequency spectrum for general coalescents	"  General genealogical processes such as $\Lambda$- and $\Xi$-coalescents,
which respectively model multiple and simultaneous mergers, have important
applications in studying marine species, strong positive selection, recurrent
selective sweeps, strong bottlenecks, large sample sizes, and so on. Recently,
there has been significant progress in developing useful inference tools for
such general models. In particular, inference methods based on the site
frequency spectrum (SFS) have received noticeable attention. Here, we derive a
new formula for the expected SFS for general $\Lambda$- and $\Xi$-coalescents,
which leads to an efficient algorithm. For time-homogeneous coalescents, the
runtime of our algorithm for computing the expected SFS is $O(n^2)$, where $n$
is the sample size. This is a factor of $n^2$ faster than the state-of-the-art
method. Furthermore, in contrast to existing methods, our method generalizes to
time-inhomogeneous $\Lambda$- and $\Xi$-coalescents with measures that
factorize as $\Lambda(dx)/\zeta(t)$ and $\Xi(dx)/\zeta(t)$, respectively, where
$\zeta$ denotes a strictly positive function of time. The runtime of our
algorithm in this setting is $O(n^3)$. We also obtain general theoretical
results for the identifiability of the $\Lambda$ measure when $\zeta$ is a
constant function, as well as for the identifiability of the function $\zeta$
under a fixed $\Xi$ measure.

1510.05850	q-bio	q-bio.MN	"Discrete gene replication events drive coupling between the cell cycle
  and circadian clocks"	"  Many organisms possess both a cell cycle to control DNA replication and a
circadian clock to anticipate changes between day and night. In some cases,
these two rhythmic systems are known to be coupled by specific,
cross-regulatory interactions. Here, we use mathematical modeling to show that,
additionally, the cell cycle generically influences circadian clocks in a
non-specific fashion: The regular, discrete jumps in gene-copy number arising
from DNA replication during the cell cycle cause a periodic driving of the
circadian clock, which can dramatically alter its behavior and impair its
function. A clock built on negative transcriptional feedback either phase locks
to the cell cycle, so that the clock period tracks the cell division time, or
exhibits erratic behavior. We argue that the cyanobacterium Synechococcus
elongatus has evolved two features that protect its clock from such
disturbances, both of which are needed to fully insulate it from the cell cycle
and give it its observed robustness: a phosphorylation-based protein
modification oscillator, together with its accompanying push-pull read-out
circuit that responds primarily to the ratios of the different phosphoforms,
makes the clock less susceptible to perturbations in protein synthesis; and the
presence of multiple, asynchronously replicating copies of the same chromosome
diminishes the effect of replicating any single copy of a gene.

  and between species?"	"  The question of what determines genetic diversity both between and within
species has long remained unsolved by the modern evolutionary theory (MET).
However, it has not deterred researchers from producing interpretations of
genetic diversity by using MET. We here examine the two key experimental
observations of genetic diversity made in the 1960s, one between species and
the other within a population of a species, that directly contributed to the
development of MET. The interpretations of these observations as well as the
assumptions by MET are widely known to be inadequate. We review the recent
progress of an alternative framework, the maximum genetic diversity (MGD)
hypothesis, that uses axioms and natural selection to explain the vast majority
of genetic diversity as being at optimum equilibrium that is largely determined
by organismal complexity. The MGD hypothesis fully absorbs the proven virtues
of MET and considers its assumptions relevant only to a much more limited
scope. This new synthesis has accounted for the much overlooked phenomenon of
progression towards higher complexity, and more importantly, been instrumental
in directing productive research into both evolutionary and biomedical
problems.

  of adaptive systems"	"  The hypothesis that living systems can benefit from operating at the vicinity
of critical points has gained momentum in recent years. Criticality may confer
an optimal balance between exceedingly ordered and too noisy states. We here
present a model, based on information theory and statistical mechanics,
illustrating how and why a community of agents aimed at understanding and
communicating with each other converges to a globally coherent state in which
all individuals are close to an internal critical state, i.e. at the borderline
between order and disorder. We study --both analytically and computationally--
the circumstances under which criticality is the best possible outcome of the
dynamical process, confirming the convergence to critical points under very
generic conditions. Finally, we analyze the effect of cooperation (agents try
to enhance not only their fitness, but also that of other individuals) and
competition (agents try to improve their own fitness and to diminish those of
competitors) within our setting. The conclusion is that, while competition
fosters criticality, cooperation hinders it and can lead to more ordered or
more disordered consensual solutions.

1510.06017	q-bio	q-bio.PE math.PR	"Two-Locus Likelihoods under Variable Population Size and Fine-Scale
  Recombination Rate Estimation"	"  Two-locus sampling probabilities have played a central role in devising an
efficient composite likelihood method for estimating fine-scale recombination
rates. Due to mathematical and computational challenges, these sampling
probabilities are typically computed under the unrealistic assumption of a
constant population size, and simulation studies have shown that resulting
recombination rate estimates can be severely biased in certain cases of
historical population size changes. To alleviate this problem, we develop here
new methods to compute the sampling probability for variable population size
functions that are piecewise constant. Our main theoretical result, implemented
in a new software package called LDpop, is a novel formula for the sampling
probability that can be evaluated by numerically exponentiating a large but
sparse matrix. This formula can handle moderate sample sizes ($n \leq 50$) and
demographic size histories with a large number of epochs ($\mathcal{D} \geq
64$). In addition, LDpop implements an approximate formula for the sampling
probability that is reasonably accurate and scales to hundreds in sample size
($n \geq 256$). Finally, LDpop includes an importance sampler for the posterior
distribution of two-locus genealogies, based on a new result for the optimal
proposal distribution in the variable-size setting. Using our methods, we study
how a sharp population bottleneck followed by rapid growth affects the
correlation between partially linked sites. Then, through an extensive
simulation study, we show that accounting for population size changes under
such a demographic model leads to substantial improvements in fine-scale
recombination rate estimation. LDpop is freely available for download at

  Forces and Diffusivity from a Single Blurred Trajectory"	"  Single Particle Tracking (SPT) can aid in understanding complex
spatio-temporal processes. However, quantifying diffusivity and forces from
individual live cell trajectories is complicated by inter- & intra-trajectory
kinetic heterogeneity, thermal fluctuations, and statistical temporal
dependence inherent to the underlying molecule's time correlated confined
dynamics experienced in the cell. Experimental artifacts such as localization
uncertainty and motion blur also obscure the data. We introduce a new maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) technique that decouples the above noise sources
and systematically treats temporal correlation via a likelihood function
(permitting more reliable extraction of effective forces from position vs. time
data). Our estimator is demonstrated to be consistent over a wide range of
exposure times, diffusion coefficients, and confinement ""radii"". The algorithm
and corresponding software can reliably extract motion parameters independent
of exposure time in trajectories exhibiting confined and/or non-stationary
dynamics and will aid in directly comparing trajectories obtained from
different imaging modalities.

schools of pelagic fish. Although the equations lack detailed balance and admit
no $H$-theorem, we are able to develop a rather complete description of
equilibrium profiles and large-time behavior, based on recent developments in
complex function theory for Bernstein and Pick functions. In the
large-population continuum limit, a scaling-invariant regime is reached in
which all equilibria are determined by a single scaling profile. This universal
profile exhibits power-law behavior crossing over from exponent $-\frac23$ for
small size to $-\frac32$ for large size, with an exponential cut-off.

society. Theoretical and experimental studies have modeled environments in
which the behaviors of humans, or agents, have been restricted to analyze their
social behavior. However, it is important that such studies are generalized to
less restrictive environments to understand human society. Social network games
(SNGs) provide a particularly powerful tool for the quantitative study of human
behavior. In SNGs, numerous players can behave more freely than in the
environments used in previous studies; moreover, their relationships include
apparent conflicts of interest and every action can be recorded. We focused on
reciprocal altruism, one of the mechanisms that generate cooperative behavior.
This study aims to investigate cooperative behavior based on reciprocal
altruism in a less restrictive environment. For this purpose, we analyzed the
social behavior underlying such cooperative behavior in an SNG. We focused on a
game scenario in which the relationship between the players was similar to that
in the Leader game. We defined cooperative behaviors by constructing a payoff
matrix in the scenario. The results showed that players maintained cooperative
behavior based on reciprocal altruism, and cooperators received more advantages
than noncooperators. We found that players constructed reciprocal relationships
based on two types of interactions, cooperative behavior and unproductive
communication.

  features"	"  Object recognition is a key function in both human and machine vision. While
recent studies have achieved fMRI decoding of seen and imagined contents, the
prediction is limited to training examples. We present a decoding approach for
arbitrary objects, using the machine vision principle that an object category
is represented by a set of features rendered invariant through hierarchical
processing. We show that visual features including those from a convolutional
neural network can be predicted from fMRI patterns and that greater accuracy is
achieved for low/high-level features with lower/higher-level visual areas,
respectively. Predicted features are used to identify seen/imagined object
categories (extending beyond decoder training) from a set of computed features
for numerous object images. Furthermore, the decoding of imagined objects
reveals progressive recruitment of higher to lower visual representations. Our
results demonstrate a homology between human and machine vision and its utility
for brain-based information retrieval.

consider a simple theoretical model that enables us to take into account human
behaviors that may interfere with vector control. The model reflects the
trade-off between perceived costs and observed efficacy. Our theoretical
results emphasize that households may reduce their protective behavior in
response to mechanical elimination techniques piloted by a public agent,
leading to an increase of the total number of mosquitoes in the surrounding
environment and generating a barrier for vector-borne diseases control. Our
study is sufficiently generic to be applied to different arboviral diseases. It
also shows that vector-control models and strategies have to take into account
human behaviors.

1510.06863	q-bio	q-bio.GN	"Identifying lineage effects when controlling for population structure
  improves power in bacterial association studies"	"  Bacteria pose unique challenges for genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
because of strong structuring into distinct strains and substantial linkage
disequilibrium across the genome. While methods developed for human studies can
correct for strain structure, this risks considerable loss- of-power because
genetic differences between strains often contribute substantial phenotypic
variability. Here we propose a new method that captures lineage-level
associations even when locus-specific associations cannot be fine-mapped. We
demonstrate its ability to detect genes and genetic variants underlying
resistance to 17 antimicrobials in 3144 isolates from four taxonomically
diverse clonal and recombining bacteria: Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Strong
selection, recombination and penetrance confer high power to recover known
antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, and reveal a candidate association between
the outer membrane porin nmpC and cefazolin resistance in E. coli. Hence our
method pinpoints locus-specific effects where possible, and boosts power by
detecting lineage-level differences when fine-mapping is intractable.

1510.07162	q-bio	q-bio.PE cs.GT physics.soc-ph	To know or not to know? How looking at payoffs signals selfish behavior	"  In daily life, subjects often face a social dilemma in two stages. In Stage
1, they recognize the social dilemma structure of the decision problem at hand
(a tension between personal interest and collective interest); in Stage 2, they
have to choose between gathering additional information to learn the exact
payoffs corresponding to each of the two options or making a choice without
looking at the payoffs. While previous theoretical research suggests that the
mere act of considering one's strategic options in a social dilemma will be met
with distrust, no experimental study has tested this hypothesis. What does
""looking at payoffs"" signal in observers? Do observers' beliefs actually match
decision makers' intentions? Experiment 1 shows that the actual action of
looking at payoffs signals selfish behavior, but it does not actually mean so.
Experiments 2 and 3 show that, when the action of looking at payoffs is
replaced by a self-report question asking the extent to which participants look
at payoffs in their everyday lives, subjects in high looking mode are indeed
more selfish than those in low looking mode, and this is correctly predicted by
observers. These results support Rand and colleagues' Social Heuristics
Hypothesis and the novel ""cooperate without looking"" model by Yoeli, Hoffman,
and Nowak. However, Experiment 1 shows that actual looking may lead to
different results, possibly caused by the emergence of a moral cleansing
effect.

Hindmarsh-Rose systems of ordinary differential equations, dividing its circuit
into six communities pointed out by the walktrap and Louvain methods. Using the
numerical solution of these equations, we analyze important measures of
dynamical complexity, namely synchronicity, the largest Lyapunov exponent, and
the $\Phi_{\mbox{AR}}$ auto-regressive integrated information theory measure,
which has been suggested to reflect different levels of consciousness. We show
that $\Phi_{\mbox{AR}}$ provides a useful measure of the information contained
in the C.elegans brain dynamic network. Our analysis reveals that the C.elegans
brain dynamic network generates more information than the sum of its
constituent parts, and that attains higher levels of integrated information for
couplings for which either all its communities are highly synchronized, or
there is a mixed state of highly synchronized and desynchronized communities.
Both situations are characterized by relatively low chaotic behavior.

Interface (BCI) based on sensorimotor rhythms. In contrast, little is known
about the influence of feedback on P300-based BCIs. There is still an open
question whether feedback affects the regulation of P300 and consequently the
operation of P300-based BCIs. In this paper, for the first time, the influence
of feedback on the P300-based BCI speller task is systematically assessed. For
this purpose, 24 healthy participants performed the classic P300-based BCI
speller task, while only half of them received feedback. Importantly, the
number of flashes per letter was reduced on a regular basis in order to
increase the frequency of providing feedback. Experimental results showed that
feedback could significantly improve the P300-based BCI speller performance, if
it was provided in short time intervals (e.g. in sequences as short as 4 to 6
flashes per row/column). Moreover, our offline analysis showed that providing
feedback remarkably enhanced the relevant ERP patterns and attenuated the
irrelevant ERP patterns, such that the discrimination between target and
nontarget EEG trials increased.

pathways. As optimality with respect to the environment plays a fundamental
role in biological systems, organisms have evolved optimal ways to transmit
information. Here, we use optimal control theory to obtain the dynamical signal
patterns for the optimal transmission of information, in terms of efficiency
(low energy) and reliability (low uncertainty). Adopting an
activation-deactivation decoding network, we reproduce several dynamical
patterns found in actual signals, such as steep, gradual, and overshooting
dynamics. Notably, when minimizing the energy of the input signal, the optimal
signals exhibit overshooting, which is a biphasic pattern with transient and
steady phases; this pattern is prevalent in actual dynamical patterns. We also
identify conditions in which these three patterns (steep, gradual, and
overshooting) confer advantages. Our study shows that cellular signal
transduction is governed by the principle of minimizing free energy dissipation
and uncertainty; these constraints serve as selective pressures when designing
dynamical signaling patterns.

survival relative to variable recruitment has been debated widely for marine
organisms. Disentangling these effects remains challenging because data
generally are not sufficient to evaluate if and how adult survival rates are
regulated by stochasticity and/or population density. Using unique time-series
for a largely unexploited reef fish, we found both population density and
stochastic food supply impacted adult survival. The estimated effect of
variable survival on adult abundance (both mean and variability) rivaled that
of variable recruitment. Moreover, we show density dependent adult survival can
dampen impacts of stochastic recruitment. Thus, food variability may alter
population fluctuations by simultaneously regulating recruitment and
compensatory adult survival. These results provide an additional mechanism for
why intensified density independent mortality (via harvest or other means)
amplifies population fluctuations and emphasizes need for research evaluating
the causes and consequences of variability in adult survival.

  Synfire Chains"	"  Coherent neural spiking and local field potentials are believed to be
signatures of the binding and transfer of information in the brain. Coherent
activity has now been measured experimentally in many regions of mammalian
cortex. Synfire chains are one of the main theoretical constructs that have
been appealed to to describe coherent spiking phenomena. However, for some
time, it has been known that synchronous activity in feedforward networks
asymptotically either approaches an attractor with fixed waveform and
amplitude, or fails to propagate. This has limited their ability to explain
graded neuronal responses. Recently, we have shown that pulse-gated synfire
chains are capable of propagating graded information coded in mean population
current or firing rate amplitudes. In particular, we showed that it is possible
to use one synfire chain to provide gating pulses and a second, pulse-gated
synfire chain to propagate graded information. We called these circuits
synfire-gated synfire chains (SGSCs). Here, we present SGSCs in which graded
information can rapidly cascade through a neural circuit, and show a
correspondence between this type of transfer and a mean-field model in which
gating pulses overlap in time. We show that SGSCs are robust in the presence of
variability in population size, pulse timing and synaptic strength. Finally, we
demonstrate the computational capabilities of SGSC-based information coding by
implementing a self-contained, spike-based, modular neural circuit that is
triggered by, then reads in streaming input, processes the input, then makes a
decision based on the processed information and shuts itself down.

show that the GNM Kirchhoff matrix can be built from the ideal low-pass filter,
which is a special case of a wide class of correlation functions underpinning
the linear scaling flexibility-rigidity index(FRI) method. Based on the
mathematical structure of correlation functions, we propose a unified framework
to construct generalized Kirchhoff matrices whose matrix inverse leads to
gGNMs, whereas, the direct inverse of its diagonal elements gives rise to FRI
method.With this connection,we further introduce two multiscale elastic network
models, namely, multiscale GNM(mGNM) and multiscale ANM(mANM), which are able
to incorporate different scales into the generalized Kirchkoff matrices or
generalized Hessian matrices.We validate our new multiscale methods with
extensive numerical experiments. We illustrate that gGNMs outperform the
original GNM method in the B-factor prediction of a set of 364 proteins.We
demonstrate that for a given correlation function, FRI and gGNM methods provide
essentially identical B-factor predictions when the scale value in the
correlation function is sufficiently large.More importantly,we reveal intrinsic
multiscale behavior in protein structures. The proposed mGNM and mANM are able
to capture this multiscale behavior and thus give rise to a significant
improvement of more than 11% in B-factor predictions over the original GNM and
ANM methods. We further demonstrate benefit of our mGNM in the B-factor
predictions on many proteins that fail the original GNM method. We show that
the present mGNM can also be used to analyze protein domain separations.
Finally, we showcase the ability of our mANM for the simulation of protein
collective motions.

  networks: impact of immunity and of limited temporal resolution"	"  The epidemic threshold of a spreading process indicates the condition for the
occurrence of the wide spreading regime, thus representing a predictor of the
network vulnerability to the epidemic. Such threshold depends on the natural
history of the disease and on the pattern of contacts of the network with its
time variation. Based on the theoretical framework introduced in (Valdano et
al. PRX 2015) for a susceptible-infectious-susceptible model, we formulate here
an infection propagator approach to compute the epidemic threshold accounting
for more realistic effects regarding a varying force of infection per contact,
the presence of immunity, and a limited time resolution of the temporal
network. We apply the approach to two temporal network models and an empirical
dataset of school contacts. We find that permanent or temporary immunity do not
affect the estimation of the epidemic threshold through the infection
propagator approach. Comparisons with numerical results show the good agreement
of the analytical predictions. Aggregating the temporal network rapidly
deteriorates the predictions, except for slow diseases once the heterogeneity
of the links is preserved. Weight-topology correlations are found to be the
critical factor to be preserved to improve accuracy in the prediction.

task in precision biology and medicine. Many technologies employ genomic
biomarkers to characterize phenotypes. However, such elements are not
sufficient to explain the underlying biology. To improve this, pathway analysis
techniques have been proposed. Nevertheless, such methods have shown lack of
accuracy in phenotypes classification. Results: Here we propose a novel
methodology called MITHrIL (Mirna enrIched paTHway Impact anaLysis) for the
analysis of signaling pathways, which has built on top of the work of Tarca et
al., 2009. MITHrIL extends pathways by adding missing regulatory elements, such
as microRNAs, and their interactions with genes. The method takes as input the
expression values of genes and/or microRNAs and returns a list of pathways
sorted according to their deregulation degree, together with the corresponding
statistical significance (p-values). Our analysis shows that MITHrIL
outperforms its competitors even in the worst case. In addition, our method is
able to correctly classify sets of tumor samples drawn from TCGA. Availability:

frequencies are typically unobserved. Can we understand how the macroscopic
observables evolve without following these microscopic processes? The problem
has previously been studied by analogy with statistical mechanics: the allele
frequency distribution at each time is approximated by the stationary form,
which maximizes entropy. We explore the limitations of this method when
mutation is small ($4N\!\mu<1$) so that populations are typically close to
fixation and we extend the theory in this regime to account for changes in
mutation strength. We consider a single diallelic locus under either
directional selection, or with over-dominance, and then generalise to multiple
unlinked biallelic loci with unequal effects. We find that the maximum entropy

study competition between different strains of a virus/bacteria. From the
mathematical point of view, we are interested whether the nonlinear infection
process leads to a well-posed model. We use a semilinear formulation to show
global existence and positivity of solutions up to a critical value of the
exponent in the nonlinearity. Furthermore, we establish the existence of the
endemic steady state for particular classes of nonlinearities.

  coarse-grained simulations"	"  Calmodulin (CaM) is a ubiquitous calcium binding protein consisting of two
structurally similar domains with distinct stabilities, binding affinities, and
flexibilities. We present coarse grained simulations that suggest the mechanism
for the domain's allosteric transitions between the open and closed
conformations depend on subtle differences in the folded state topology of the
two domains. Throughout a wide temperature range, the simulated transition
mechanism of the N-terminal domain (nCaM) follows a two-state transition
mechanism while domain opening in the C-terminal domain (cCaM) involves
unfolding and refolding of the tertiary structure. The appearance of the
unfolded intermediate occurs at a higher temperature in nCaM than it does in
cCaM consistent with nCaM's higher thermal stability. Under approximate
physiological conditions, the simulated unfolded state population of cCaM
accounts for 10% of the population with nearly all of the sampled transitions
(approximately 95%) unfolding and refolding during the conformational change.
Transient unfolding significantly slows the domain opening and closing rates of
cCaM. This potentially influences the mechanism of calcium binding to each
domain.

corneocytes (keratin filled dead cells) in a specialized lipid matrix. The
continuous lipid matrix provides the main barrier against uncontrolled water
loss and invasion of external pathogens. Unlike all other biological lipid
membranes (like intracellular organelles and plasma membranes), molecules in SC
lipid matrix show small hydrophilic group and large variability in the length
of the alkyl tails and in the numbers and positions of groups that are capable
of forming hydrogen bonds. Molecular simulations provide a route for
systematically probing the effects of each of these differences separately. In
this article we present results from atomistic molecular dynamics of selected
lipid bilayers and multilayers to probe the effect of these polydispersities.
We address the nature of the tail packing in the gel-like phase, the hydrogen
bond network among head groups, the bending moduli expected for leaflets
comprising SC lipids, and the conformation of very long ceramide lipids (EOS)
in multibilayer lipid assemblies.

1510.08965	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Defining individual size in the model filamentous fungus
  $\textit{Neurospora crassa}$"	"  It is challenging to apply the tenets of individuality to filamentous fungi:
a fungal mycelium can contain millions of genetically diverse but totipotent
nuclei, each capable of founding new mycelia. Moreover a single mycelium can
potentially stretch over kilometers and it is unlikely that its distant parts
share resources or have the same fitness. Here we directly measure how a single
mycelium of the model ascomycete {\it Neurospora crassa} is patterned into
Reproductive Units (RUs); subpopulations of nuclei that propagate together as
spores, and function as reproductive individuals. The density of RUs is
sensitive to the geometry of growth; we detect 50-fold smaller RUs when mycelia
had expanding frontiers than when they were constrained to grow in one
direction only. RUs fragmented further when the mycelial network was perturbed.
In mycelia with expanding frontiers RU composition was strongly influenced by
the distribution of genotypes early in development. Our results provide a
concept of fungal individuality that is directly connected to reproductive
potential, and therefore to theories of how fungal individuals adapt and evolve
over time. Our data show that the size of reproductive individuals is a dynamic
and environment-dependent property, even within apparently totally connected
fungal mycelia.

information-carrying signals, which are encoded and transmitted via correlated
sequences of spikes. Here we investigate relative temporal order in spike
sequences induced by a subthreshold periodic input, in the presence of white
Gaussian noise. To simulate the spikes, we use the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, and
to investigate the output sequence of inter-spike intervals (ISIs), we use the
symbolic method of ordinal analysis. We find different types of relative
temporal order, in the form of preferred ordinal patterns which depend on both,
the strength of the noise and the period of the input signal. We also
demonstrate a resonance-like behavior, as certain periods and noise levels
enhance temporal ordering in the ISI sequence, maximizing the probability of
the preferred patterns. Our findings could be relevant for understanding the
mechanisms underlying temporal coding, by which single sensory neurons
represent in spike sequences the information about weak periodic stimuli.

1510.09073	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Autocratic strategies for iterated games with arbitrary action spaces	"  The recent discovery of zero-determinant strategies for the iterated
Prisoner's Dilemma sparked a surge of interest in the surprising fact that a
player can exert unilateral control over iterated interactions. These
remarkable strategies, however, are known to exist only in games in which
players choose between two alternative actions such as ""cooperate"" and
""defect."" Here we introduce a broader class of autocratic strategies by
extending zero-determinant strategies to iterated games with more general
action spaces. We use the continuous Donation Game as an example, which
represents an instance of the Prisoner's Dilemma that intuitively extends to a
continuous range of cooperation levels. Surprisingly, despite the fact that the
opponent has infinitely many donation levels from which to choose, a player can
devise an autocratic strategy to enforce a linear relationship between his or
her payoff and that of the opponent even when restricting his or her actions to
merely two discrete levels of cooperation. In particular, a player can use such
a strategy to extort an unfair share of the payoffs from the opponent.
Therefore, although the action space of the continuous Donation Game dwarfs
that of the classical Prisoner's Dilemma, players can still devise relatively
simple autocratic and, in particular, extortionate strategies.

1511.00083	q-bio	q-bio.NC cs.AI	"Why Neurons Have Thousands of Synapses, A Theory of Sequence Memory in
  Neocortex"	"  Neocortical neurons have thousands of excitatory synapses. It is a mystery
how neurons integrate the input from so many synapses and what kind of
large-scale network behavior this enables. It has been previously proposed that
non-linear properties of dendrites enable neurons to recognize multiple
patterns. In this paper we extend this idea by showing that a neuron with
several thousand synapses arranged along active dendrites can learn to
accurately and robustly recognize hundreds of unique patterns of cellular
activity, even in the presence of large amounts of noise and pattern variation.
We then propose a neuron model where some of the patterns recognized by a
neuron lead to action potentials and define the classic receptive field of the
neuron, whereas the majority of the patterns recognized by a neuron act as
predictions by slightly depolarizing the neuron without immediately generating
an action potential. We then present a network model based on neurons with
these properties and show that the network learns a robust model of time-based
sequences. Given the similarity of excitatory neurons throughout the neocortex
and the importance of sequence memory in inference and behavior, we propose
that this form of sequence memory is a universal property of neocortical
tissue. We further propose that cellular layers in the neocortex implement
variations of the same sequence memory algorithm to achieve different aspects
of inference and behavior. The neuron and network models we introduce are
robust over a wide range of parameters as long as the network uses a sparse
distributed code of cellular activations. The sequence capacity of the network
scales linearly with the number of synapses on each neuron. Thus neurons need
thousands of synapses to learn the many temporal patterns in sensory stimuli
and motor sequences.

1511.00107	q-bio	q-bio.GN q-bio.QM	"repgenHMM: a dynamic programming tool to infer the rules of immune
  receptor generation from sequence data"	"  The diversity of the immune repertoire is initially generated by random
rearrangements of the receptor gene during early T and B cell development.
Rearrangement scenarios are composed of random events -- choices of gene
templates, base pair deletions and insertions -- described by probability
distributions. Not all scenarios are equally likely, and the same receptor
sequence may be obtained in several different ways. Quantifying the
distribution of these rearrangements is an essential baseline for studying the
immune system diversity. Inferring the properties of the distributions from
receptor sequences is a computationally hard problem, requiring enumerating
every possible scenario for every sampled receptor sequence. We present a
Hidden Markov model, which accounts for all plausible scenarios that can
generate the receptor sequences. We developed and implemented a method based on
the Baum-Welch algorithm that can efficiently infer the parameters for the
different events of the rearrangement process. We tested our software tool on
sequence data for both the alpha and beta chains of the T cell receptor. To
test the validity of our algorithm, we also generated synthetic sequences
produced by a known model, and confirmed that its parameters could be
accurately inferred back from the sequences. The inferred model can be used to
generate synthetic sequences, to calculate the probability of generation of any
receptor sequence, as well as the theoretical diversity of the repertoire. We
estimate this diversity to be $\approx 10^{23}$ for human T cells. The model
gives a baseline to investigate the selection and dynamics of immune
repertoires.

1511.00171	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio.MN q-bio.SC	Know the single-receptor sensing limit? Think again	"  How cells reliably infer information about their environment is a
fundamentally important question. While sensing and signaling generally start
with cell-surface receptors, the degree of accuracy with which a cell can
measure external ligand concentration with even the simplest device - a single
receptor - is surprisingly hard to pin down. Recent studies provide conflicting
results for the fundamental physical limits. Comparison is made difficult as
different studies either suggest different readout mechanisms of the
ligand-receptor occupancy, or differ on how ligand diffusion is implemented.
Here we critically analyse these studies and present a unifying perspective on
the limits of sensing, with wide-ranging biological implications.

Caenorhabditis elegans to reveal dynamically relevant features of its
connectome. We find flow-based groupings of neurons at different levels of
granularity, which we relate to functional and anatomical constituents of its
nervous system. A systematic in silico evaluation of the full set of single and
double neuron ablations is used to identify deletions that induce the most
severe disruptions of the multi-resolution flow structure. Such ablations are
linked to functionally relevant neurons, and suggest potential candidates for
further in vivo investigation. In addition, we use the directional patterns of
incoming and outgoing network flows at all scales to identify flow profiles for
the neurons in the connectome, without pre-imposing a priori categories. The
four flow roles identified are linked to signal propagation motivated by
biological input-response scenarios.

the beginning of the reproductive season in the $m$th year. We study the
following impulsive reaction-diffusion model for any $m\in \mathbb Z^+$
\begin{eqnarray*}\label{}
  \ \ \ \ \ \left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
  u^{(m)}_t = div(A\nabla u^{(m)}-a u^{(m)}) + f(u^{(m)}) \quad \text{for} \ \

  \end{eqnarray*} for functions $f,g$, a drift $a$ and a diffusion matrix $A$
and $\Omega\subset \mathbb R^n$. Study of this model requires a simultaneous
analysis of the differential equation and the recurrence relation. When
boundary conditions are hostile we provide critical domain results showing how
extinction versus persistence of the species arises, depending on the size and
geometry of the domain. We show that there exists an {\it extreme volume size}
such that if $|\Omega|$ falls below this size the species is driven extinct,
regardless of the geometry of the domain. To construct such extreme volume
sizes and critical domain sizes, we apply Schwarz symmetrization rearrangement
arguments, the classical Rayleigh-Faber-Krahn inequality and the spectrum of
uniformly elliptic operators. The critical domain results provide qualitative
insight regarding long-term dynamics for the model. Lastly, we provide
applications of our main results to certain biological reaction-diffusion
models regarding marine reserve, terrestrial reserve, insect pest outbreak and
population subject to climate change.

forces. By performing active microrheology and tracking micron-sized vesicles
in the cytoplasm of living oocytes, we provide unprecedented measurements of
the spectrum of dissipated energy. We show that our model is fully consistent

biological systems, from small reaction networks to large ensembles of cells.
Here we present a novel approach for stochastic simulation of networks embedded
in the dynamic environment of the cell and its surroundings. We thus sample
trajectories of the stochastic process described by the chemical master
equation with time-varying propensities. A comparative analysis shows that
existing approaches can either fail dramatically, or else can impose
impractical computational burdens due to numerical integration of reaction
propensities, especially when cell ensembles are studied. Here we introduce the
Extrande method which, given a simulated time course of dynamic network inputs,
provides a conditionally exact and several orders-of-magnitude faster
simulation solution. The new approach makes it feasible to demonstrate, using
decision-making by a large population of quorum sensing bacteria, that
robustness to fluctuations from upstream signaling places strong constraints on
the design of networks determining cell fate. Our approach has the potential to
significantly advance both understanding of molecular systems biology and
design of synthetic circuits.

depletes its environment and starves if it wanders too long without eating. In
the framework of the minimal starving random walk model with resource renewal,
there are three universal classes of behavior as a function of the renewal
time. For sufficiently rapid renewal, foragers are immortal, while foragers
have a finite lifetime otherwise. In one dimension, there is a third regime,
for sufficiently slow renewal, in which the lifetime of the forager is
independent of the renewal time. We outline an enumeration method to determine
the mean lifetime of the forager in the mortal regime.

the lens of computation, has already started yielding new insights, e.g.,
natural selection under sexual reproduction can be interpreted as the
Multiplicative Weight Update (MWU) Algorithm in coordination games played among
genes [CLPV14]. Using this machinery, we study the role of mutation in changing
environments in the presence of sexual reproduction. Following [WVA05], we
model changing environments via a Markov chain, with the states representing
environments, each with its own fitness matrix. In this setting, we show that
in the absence of mutation, the population goes extinct, but in the presence of
mutation, the population survives with positive probability. On the way to
proving the above theorem, we need to establish some facts about dynamics in
games. We provide the first, to our knowledge, polynomial convergence bound for
noisy MWU in a coordination game. Finally, we also show that in static
environments, sexual evolution with mutation converges, for any level of
mutation.

crystallography, which is limited by the requirement to trap molecules within a
crystal lattice. Therefore, characterisations of the conformational dynamics of
the activation loop in solution are important to enhance the understanding of
molecular processes related to diseases and to support the discovery of small
molecule kinase inhibitors. In this work, we demonstrated that long molecular
dynamics simulations exhaustively sampled all the conformational space of the
activation loop of the Aurora-A kinase and of the methane-thiosulfonate spin
label, introduced into the activation loop for the electron paramagnetic
measurements. MD was used to determine structural fluctuations, order
parameters and rotational correlation times of the motion of the activation
loop and of the MTSL. Theoretical data obtained were used as input for the
calculation of the room temperature 9 GHz continuous wave EPR of the Aurora-A
kinase in solution and the comparison between simulated and experimental date
revealed that the motion of the protein and spin label occurred on comparable
timescales. This work is a starting point for deeper experimental and
theoretical studies of the rotational and translational diffusion properties of
the Aurora-A kinase protein related to its biological activity.

  networks"	"  Due to rapid advances in multielectrode recording technology, the local field
potential (LFP) has again become a popular measure of neuronal activity in both
basic research and clinical applications. Proper understanding of the LFP
requires detailed mathematical modeling incorporating the anatomical and
electrophysiological features of neurons near the recording electrode, as well
as synaptic inputs from the entire network. Here we propose a hybrid modeling
scheme combining the efficiency of commonly used simplified point-neuron
network models with the biophysical principles underlying LFP generation by
real neurons. The scheme can be used with an arbitrary number of point-neuron
network populations. The LFP predictions rely on populations of
network-equivalent, anatomically reconstructed multicompartment neuron models
with layer-specific synaptic connectivity. The present scheme allows for a full
separation of the network dynamics simulation and LFP generation. For
illustration, we apply the scheme to a full-scale cortical network model for a
$\sim$1 mm$^2$ patch of primary visual cortex and predict laminar LFPs for
different network states, assess the relative LFP contribution from different
laminar populations, and investigate the role of synaptic input correlations
and neuron density on the LFP. The generic nature of the hybrid scheme and its
publicly available implementation in \texttt{hybridLFPy} form the basis for LFP
predictions from other point-neuron network models, as well as extensions of
the current application to larger circuitry and additional biological detail.

actively growing and remodeling surfaces. Using this framework we develop a
physical model for growing bacterial cell walls and study the interplay of cell
shape with the dynamics of growth and constriction. The model allows us to
derive constraints on cell wall mechanical energy based on the observed
dynamics of cell shape. We predict that exponential growth in cell size
requires a constant amount of cell wall energy to be dissipated per unit
volume. We use the model to understand and contrast growth in bacteria with
different shapes such as spherical, ellipsoidal, cylindrical and toroidal
morphologies. Coupling growth to cell wall constriction, we predict a
discontinuous shape transformation, from partial constriction to cell division,
as a function of the chemical potential driving cell-wall synthesis. Our model
for cell wall energy and shape dynamics relates growth kinetics with cell
geometry, and provides a unified framework to describe the interplay between
shape, growth and division in bacterial cells.

inferring phylogenetic trees without first obtaining a multiple sequence
alignment. We show that a standard approach of using the squared-Euclidean
distance between $k$-mer vectors to approximate a tree metric can be
statistically inconsistent. To remedy this, we derive model-based distance
corrections for orthologous sequences without gaps, which lead to consistent
tree inference. The identifiability of model parameters from $k$-mer
frequencies is also studied. Finally, we report simulations showing the
corrected distance out-performs many other $k$-mer methods, even when sequences
are generated with an insertion and deletion process. These results have
implications for multiple sequence alignment as well, since $k$-mer methods are
usually the first step in constructing a guide tree for such algorithms.

local interactions. An essential difference with analogous ferromagnetic
systems is that flocks are active: animals move relative to each other,
dynamically rearranging their interaction network. The effect of this
off-equilibrium element is well studied theoretically, but its impact on actual
biological groups deserves more experimental attention. Here, we introduce a
novel dynamical inference technique, based on the principle of maximum entropy,
which accodomates network rearrangements and overcomes the problem of slow
experimental sampling rates. We use this method to infer the strength and range
of alignment forces from data of starling flocks. We find that local bird
alignment happens on a much faster timescale than neighbour rearrangement.
Accordingly, equilibrium inference, which assumes a fixed interaction network,
gives results consistent with dynamical inference. We conclude that bird
orientations are in a state of local quasi-equilibrium over the interaction
length scale, providing firm ground for the applicability of statistical
physics in certain active systems.

we propose a coarse-grained elastic network model of DNA, where each nucleotide
is described only by one node. This model could effectively reproduce the

the sequence-dependent geometry. Through normal-mode analysis for the
coarse-grained elastic network model, we exhaustively analyzed the dynamic

calls for the development of advanced data analysis tools, as commonly used
techniques do not suffice to capture the spatio-temporal network complexity. In
this paper, we propose a new hierarchical coupled geometry analysis, which

local partitioning of the data in flexible trees through a new multiscale

  Quasi-potential, A-type Integral and Beyond"	"  Motivated by the famous Waddington's epigenetic landscape metaphor in
developmental biology, biophysicists and applied mathematicians made different
proposals to realize this metaphor in a rationalized way. We adopt
comprehensive perspectives to systematically investigate three different but
closely related realizations in recent literature: namely the potential
landscape theory from the steady state distribution of stochastic differential
equations (SDEs), the quasi-potential from the large deviation theory, and the
construction through SDE decomposition and A-type integral.The connections
among these theories are established in this paper. We demonstrate that the
quasi-potential is the zero noise limit of the potential landscape. We also
show that the potential function in the third proposal coincides with the
quasi-potential. The most probable transition path by minimizing the
Onsager-Machlup or Freidlin-Wentzell action functional is discussed as well.
Furthermore, we compare the difference between local and global quasi-potential
through the exchange of limit order for time and noise amplitude. As a
consequence of such explorations, we arrive at the existence result for the SDE
decomposition while deny its uniqueness in general cases. It is also clarified
that the A-type integral is more appropriate to be applied to the decomposed
SDEs rather than the original one. Our results contribute to a better
understanding of existing landscape theories for biological systems.

diseases. We point out that very similar systems play an important role in
population ecology. Specifically we study a meta food-web model that was
recently proposed by Pillai et al. This model describes a network of species
connected by feeding interactions, which spread over a network of spatial
patches. Focusing on the essential case, where the network of feeding
interactions is a chain, we develop an analytical approach for the computation
of the degree distributions of colonized spatial patches for the different
species in the chain. This framework allows us to address ecologically relevant
questions. Considering configuration model ensembles of spatial networks, we
find that there is an upper bound for the fraction of patches that a given
species can occupy, which depends only on the networks mean degree. For a given
mean degree there is then an optimal degree distribution that comes closest to
the upper bound. Notably scale-free degree distributions perform worse than
more homogeneous degree distributions if the mean degree is sufficiently high.
Because species experience the underlying network differently the optimal
degree distribution for one particular species is generally not the optimal
distribution for the other species in the same food web. These results are of
interest for conservation ecology, where, for instance, the task of selecting
areas of old-growth forest to preserve in an agricultural landscape, amounts to
the design of a patch network.

1511.02268	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio.BM	Coarse-grained molecular simulations of allosteric cooperativity	"  Interactions between a protein and a ligand are often accompanied by a
redistribution of the population of thermally accessible conformations. This
dynamic response of the protein's functional energy landscape enables a protein
to modulate binding affinities and control binding sensitivity to ligand
concentration. In this paper, we investigate the structural origins of binding
affinity and allosteric cooperativity of binding two calcium ions to each
domain of calmodulin (CaM) through simulations of a simple coarse-grained
model. In this model, the protein's conformational transitions between open and
closed conformational ensembles are simulated explicitly and ligand binding and
unbinding is treated implicitly within the Grand Canonical Ensemble. Ligand
binding is cooperative because the binding sites are coupled through a shift in
the dominant conformational ensemble upon binding. The classic
Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of allostery with appropriate binding free energy to
the open and closed ensembles accurately describes the simulated binding
thermodynamics. The simulations predict that the two domains of CaM have
distinct binding affinity and cooperativity. In particular, C-terminal domain
binds calcium with higher affinity and greater cooperativity than the
N-terminal domain. From a structural point of view, the affinity of an
individual binding loop depends sensitively on the loop's structural
compatibility with the ligand in the bound ensemble, as well as the
conformational flexibility of the binding site in the unbound ensemble.

literature in recent years, however unlike the standard SIR model, they often
lack a derivation from an underlying stochastic process. Here we derive a
fractional-order infectivity SIR model from a stochastic process that
incorporates a time-since-infection dependence on the infectivity of
individuals. The fractional derivative appears in the generalised master
equations of a continuous time random walk through SIR compartments, with a
power-law function in the infectivity. We show that this model can also be

evolution in a spatially structured population. Exact analytical solutions for
the fixation probability and time of a new mutant have been found for only a
few classes of graphs so far. Simulations are time-expensive and many
realizations are necessary, as the variance of the fixation times is high. We
present an algorithm that numerically computes these quantities for arbitrary
small graphs by an approach based on the transition matrix. The advantage over
simulations is that the calculation has to be executed only once. Building the
transition matrix is automated by our algorithm. This enables a fast and

1511.03011	q-bio	q-bio.BM cond-mat.soft	The Ramachandran number: an order parameter for protein geometry	"  Three-dimensional protein structures usually contain regions of local order,
called secondary structure, such as $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-sheets.
Secondary structure is characterized by the local rotational state of the
protein backbone, quantified by two dihedral angles called $\phi$ and $\psi$.
Particular types of secondary structure can generally be described by a single
(diffuse) location on a two-dimensional plot drawn in the space of the angles
$\phi$ and $\psi$, called a Ramachandran plot. By contrast, a
recently-discovered nanomaterial made from peptoids, structural isomers of
peptides, displays a secondary-structure motif corresponding to two regions on
the Ramachandran plot [Mannige et al., Nature 526, 415 (2015)]. In order to
describe such `higher-order' secondary structure in a compact way we introduce
here a means of describing regions on the Ramachandran plot in terms of a
single Ramachandran number, ${\mathcal{R}}$, which is a structurally meaningful
combination of $\phi$ and $\psi$. We show that the potential applications of
${\mathcal{R}}$ are numerous: it can be used to describe the geometric content
of protein structures, and can be used to draw diagrams that reveal, at a
glance, the frequency of occurrence of regular secondary structures and
disordered regions in large protein datasets. We propose that ${\mathcal{R}}$
might be used as an order parameter for protein geometry for a wide range of
applications.

1511.03141	q-bio	math.CO physics.bio-ph q-bio.BM	Sequence-structure relations of biopolymers	"  Motivation: DNA data is transcribed into single-stranded RNA, which folds
into specific molecular structures. In this paper we pose the question to what
extent sequence- and structure-information correlate. We view this correlation
as structural semantics of sequence data that allows for a different
interpretation than conventional sequence alignment. Structural semantics could
enable us to identify more general embedded ""patterns"" in DNA and RNA
sequences. Results: We compute the partition function of sequences with respect
to a fixed structure and connect this computation to the mutual information of
a sequence-structure pair for RNA secondary structures. We present a Boltzmann
sampler and obtain the a priori probability of specific sequence patterns. We
present a detailed analysis for the three PDB-structures, 2JXV (hairpin), 2N3R
(3-branch multi-loop) and 1EHZ (tRNA). We localize specific sequence patterns,
contrast the energy spectrum of the Boltzmann sampled sequences versus those
sequences that refold into the same structure and derive a criterion to
identify native structures. We illustrate that there are multiple sequences in
the partition function of a fixed structure, each having nearly the same mutual
information, that are nevertheless poorly aligned. This indicates the
possibility of the existence of relevant patterns embedded in the sequences
that are not discoverable using alignments.

1511.03150	q-bio	q-bio.SC math.PR	Ultrasensitivity and sharp threshold theorems for multisite systems	"  We study the ultrasensitivity of multisite binding processes where ligand
molecules can bind to several binding sites, considering more particularly
recent models involving complex chemical reactions in phosphorylation systems
such as allosteric phosphorylation processes, or substrate-catalyst chain
reactions and nucleosome mediated cooperativity. New statistics based formulas
for the Hill coefficient and the effective Hill coefficient are provided and
necessary conditions for a system to be ultrasensitive are exhibited. We then
assume that the binding process is described by a density dependent birth and
death process. We provide precise large deviation results for the steady state
distribution of the process, and show that switch-like ultrasensitive responses
are strongly related to the multi-stability of the associated dynamical system.
Ultrasensitivity occurs if and only if the entropy of the dynamical system has
more than one global minimum for some critical ligand concentration. In this
case, the Hill coefficient is proportional to the number of binding sites, and
the systems is highly ultrasensitive. We also discuss the interpretation of an
extension $I_q$ of the effective Hill coefficient $I_{0.9}$ for which we
recommend the computation of a broad range of values of $q$ instead of just the
standard one corresponding to the 10% to 90% variation in the dose-response. It
is shown that this single choice can sometimes mislead the conclusion by not
detecting ultrasensitivity. This new approach allows a better understanding of
multisite ultrasensitive systems and provides new tools for the design of such
systems.

  Coupled by Bulk Diffusion"	"  A class of coupled cell-bulk ODE-PDE models is formulated and analyzed in a
two-dimensional domain, which is relevant to studying quorum sensing behavior
on thin substrates. In this model, spatially segregated dynamically active
signaling cells of a common small radius $\epsilon\ll 1$ are coupled through a
passive bulk diffusion field. The method of matched asymptotic expansions is
used to construct steady-state solutions and to formulate a spectral problem
that characterizes the linear stability properties of these solutions, with the
aim of predicting whether temporal oscillations can be triggered by the
cell-bulk coupling. Phase diagrams in parameter space where such collective
oscillations can occur are illustrated for two specific choices of the
intracellular kinetics. In the limit of very large bulk diffusion, it is shown
that the ODE-PDE system can be approximated by a finite-dimensional dynamical
system, which is studied both analytically and numerically. For one
illustrative example of the theory it is shown that when the number of cells
exceeds some critical number, the bulk diffusion field can trigger oscillations
that would otherwise not occur without the coupling. Moreover, for two specific
models for the intracellular dynamics, we show that there are rather wide
regions in parameter space where these triggered oscillations are synchronous
in nature. Unless the bulk diffusivity is asymptotically large, it is shown
that a clustered spatial configuration of cells inside the domain leads to
larger regions in parameter space where synchronous collective oscillations
between the small cells can occur. Finally, the linear stability analysis for
these cell-bulk models is shown to be qualitatively rather similar to that of
localized spot patterns for activator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion systems in
the limit of long-range inhibition and short-range activation.

1511.03721	q-bio	q-bio.PE cond-mat.stat-mech physics.soc-ph	"Mathematical toy model inspired by the problem of the adaptive origins
  of the sexual orientation continuum"	"  Same-sex sexual behavior is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, but its
adaptive origins remain a prominent puzzle. Here I suggest the possibility that
same-sex sexual behavior arises as a consequence of the competition between an
evolutionary drive for a wide diversity in traits, which improves the
adaptability of a species, and a drive for sexual dichotomization of traits,
which promotes opposite-sex attraction and increases the rate of reproduction.
A simple analytical ""toy model"" is proposed for describing this tradeoff. The
model exhibits a number of interesting features, and suggests a simple
mathematical form for describing the sexual orientation continuum.

  metabolism: Consequence of anti-phase coupling between reaction flux and
  affinity"	"  Cells generally convert nutrient resources to useful products via energy
transduction. Accordingly, the thermodynamic efficiency of this conversion
process is one of the most essential characteristics of living organisms.
However, although these processes occur under conditions of dynamic metabolism,
most studies of cellular thermodynamic efficiency have been restricted to
examining steady states; thus, the relevance of dynamics to this efficiency has
not yet been elucidated. Here, we develop a simple model of metabolic reactions
with anabolism-catabolism coupling catalysed by enzymes. Through application of
external oscillation in the enzyme abundances, the thermodynamic efficiency of
metabolism was found to be improved. This result is in strong contrast with
that observed in the oscillatory input, in which the efficiency always
decreased with oscillation. This improvement was effectively achieved by
separating the anabolic and catabolic reactions, which tend to disequilibrate
each other, and taking advantage of the temporal oscillations so that each of
the antagonistic reactions could progress near equilibrium. In this case,
anti-phase oscillation between the reaction flux and chemical affinity through
oscillation of enzyme abundances is essential. This improvement was also
confirmed in a model capable of generating autonomous oscillations in enzyme
abundances. Finally, the possible relevance of the improvement in thermodynamic
efficiency is discussed with respect to the potential for manipulation of
metabolic oscillations in microorganisms.

1511.03963	q-bio	q-bio.SC	"A stochastic model for gene transcription on Drosophila melanogaster
  embryos"	"  We examine immunostaining experimental data for the formation of the strip 2
of $even-skipped$ ($eve$) transcripts on $D.$ $melanogaster$ embryos. An
estimate of the factor converting immunofluorescence intensity units into
molecular numbers is given. The analysis of the $eve$ mRNA's dynamics at the
region of the stripe 2 suggests that the promoter site of the gene has two
distinct regimes: an earlier phase when it is predominantly activated until a
critical time when it becomes mainly repressed. That suggests proposing a
stochastic binary model for gene transcription on $D.$ $melanogaster$ embryos.
Our model has two random variables: the transcripts number and the state of the
source of mRNAs given as active or repressed. We are able to reproduce
available experimental data for the average number of transcripts. An analysis
of the random fluctuations on the number of $eve$ mRNA's and their consequences
on the spatial precision of the stripe 2 is presented. We show that the
position of the anterior/posterior borders fluctuate around their average
position by $\sim 1 \%$ of the embryo length which is similar to what is found
experimentally. The fitting of data by such a simple model suggests that it can
be useful to understand the functions of randomness during developmental
processes.

1511.03965	q-bio	q-bio.MN	Phenotypic spandrel: absolute discrimination and ligand antagonism	"  We consider the general problem of sensitive and specific discrimination
between biochemical species. An important instance is immune discrimination
between self and not-self, where it is also observed experimentally that
ligands just below discrimination threshold negatively impact response, a
phenomenon called antagonism. We characterize mathematically the generic
properties of such discrimination, first relating it to biochemical adaptation.
Then, based on basic biochemical rules, we establish that, surprisingly,
antagonism is a generic consequence of any strictly specific discrimination
made independently from ligand concentration. Thus antagonism constitutes a
""phenotypic spandrel"": a phenotype existing as a necessary by-product of
another phenotype. We exhibit a simple analytic model of discrimination
displaying antagonism, where antagonism strength is linear in distance from
detection threshold. This contrasts with traditional proofreading based models
where antagonism vanishes far from threshold and thus displays an inverted
hierarchy of antagonism compared to simpler models. The phenotypic spandrel
studied here is expected to structure many decision pathways such as immune
detection mediated by TCRs and FC$\epsilon$RIs, as well as endocrine
signalling/disruption.

1511.04025	q-bio	physics.soc-ph q-bio.PE	Conflicting attachment and the growth of bipartite networks	"  Simple growth mechanisms have been proposed to explain the emergence of
seemingly universal network structures. The widely-studied model of
preferential attachment assumes that new nodes are more likely to connect to
highly connected nodes. Preferential attachment explains the emergence of
scale-free degree distributions within complex networks. Yet, it is
incompatible with many network systems, particularly bipartite systems in which
two distinct types of agents interact. For example, the addition of new links
in a host-parasite system corresponds to the infection of hosts by parasites.
Increasing connectivity is beneficial to a parasite and detrimental to a host.
Therefore, the overall network connectivity is subject to conflicting
pressures. Here, we propose a stochastic network growth model of conflicting
attachment, inspired by a particular kind of parasite-host interactions: that
of viruses interacting with microbial hosts. The mechanism of network growth
includes conflicting preferences to network density as well as costs involved
in modifying the network connectivity according to these preferences. We find
that the resulting networks exhibit realistic patterns commonly observed in
empirical data, including the emergence of nestedness, modularity, and
nested-modular structures that exhibit both properties. We study the role of
conflicting interests in shaping network structure and assess opportunities to
incorporate greater realism in linking growth process to pattern in systems
governed by antagonistic and mutualistic interactions.

1511.04156	q-bio	stat.ML cs.LG q-bio.NC	Neuroprosthetic decoder training as imitation learning	"  Neuroprosthetic brain-computer interfaces function via an algorithm which
decodes neural activity of the user into movements of an end effector, such as
a cursor or robotic arm. In practice, the decoder is often learned by updating
its parameters while the user performs a task. When the user's intention is not
directly observable, recent methods have demonstrated value in training the
decoder against a surrogate for the user's intended movement. We describe how
training a decoder in this way is a novel variant of an imitation learning
problem, where an oracle or expert is employed for supervised training in lieu
of direct observations, which are not available. Specifically, we describe how
a generic imitation learning meta-algorithm, dataset aggregation (DAgger, [1]),
can be adapted to train a generic brain-computer interface. By deriving
existing learning algorithms for brain-computer interfaces in this framework,
we provide a novel analysis of regret (an important metric of learning
efficacy) for brain-computer interfaces. This analysis allows us to
characterize the space of algorithmic variants and bounds on their regret
rates. Existing approaches for decoder learning have been performed in the
cursor control setting, but the available design principles for these decoders
are such that it has been impossible to scale them to naturalistic settings.
Leveraging our findings, we then offer an algorithm that combines imitation
learning with optimal control, which should allow for training of arbitrary
effectors for which optimal control can generate goal-oriented control. We
demonstrate this novel and general BCI algorithm with simulated neuroprosthetic
control of a 26 degree-of-freedom model of an arm, a sophisticated and
realistic end effector.

1511.04202	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Spatial frequency processing in the central and peripheral visual field
  during scene viewing"	"  Visuospatial attention and gaze control depend on the interaction of foveal
and peripheral processing. The foveal and peripheral regions of the visual
field are differentially sensitive to parts of the spatial-frequency spectrum.
In two experiments, we investigated how the selective attenuation of spatial
frequencies in the central or the peripheral visual field affects eye-movement
behavior during real-world scene viewing. Gaze-contingent low-pass or high-pass
filters with varying filter levels (i.e., cutoff frequencies; Experiment 1) or
filter sizes (Experiment 2) were applied. Compared to unfiltered control
conditions, mean fixation durations increased most with central high-pass and
peripheral low-pass filtering. Increasing filter size prolonged fixation
durations with peripheral filtering, but not with central filtering. Increasing
filter level prolonged fixation durations with low-pass filtering, but not with
high-pass filtering. These effects indicate that fixation durations are not
always longer under conditions of increased processing difficulty. Saccade
amplitudes largely adapted to processing difficulty: amplitudes increased with
central filtering and decreased with peripheral filtering; the effects
strengthened with increasing filter size and filter level. In addition, we
observed a trade-off between saccade timing and saccadic selection, since
saccade amplitudes were modulated when fixation durations were unaffected by
the experimental manipulations. We conclude that interactions of perception and
gaze control are highly sensitive to experimental manipulations of input images
as long as the residual information can still be accessed for gaze control.

1511.04249	q-bio	q-bio.CB	"Requirements for efficient cell-type proportioning: regulatory
  timescales, stochasticity and lateral inhibition"	"  The proper functioning of multicellular organisms requires the robust
establishment of precise proportions between distinct cell-types. This
developmental differentiation process typically involves intracellular
regulatory and stochastic mechanisms to generate cell-fate diversity as well as
intercellular mechanisms to coordinate cell-fate decisions at tissue level. We
thus surmise that key insights about the developmental regulation of cell-type
proportion can be captured by the modeling study of clustering dynamics in
population of inhibitory-coupled noisy bistable systems. This general class of
dynamical system is shown to exhibit a very stable two-cluster state, but also
frustrated relaxation, collective oscillations or steady-state hopping which
prevents from timely and reliably reaching a robust and well-proportioned
clustered state. To circumvent these obstacles or to avoid fine-tuning, we
highlight a general strategy based on dual-time positive feedback loops, such
as mediated through transcriptional versus epigenetic mechanisms, which
improves proportion regulation by coordinating early and flexible lineage
priming with late and firm commitment. This result sheds new light on the
respective and cooperative roles of multiple regulatory feedback, stochasticity
and lateral inhibition in developmental dynamics.

  Subtraction Approach"	"  In order to perform electroencephalography (EEG) source reconstruction, i.e.,
to localize the sources underlying a measured EEG, the electric potential
distribution at the electrodes generated by a dipolar current source in the
brain has to be simulated, which is the so-called EEG forward problem. To solve
it accurately, it is necessary to apply numerical methods that are able to take
the individual geometry and conductivity distribution of the subject's head
into account. In this context, the finite element method (FEM) has shown high
numerical accuracy with the possibility to model complex geometries and
conductive features, e.g., white matter conductivity anisotropy. In this
article, we introduce and analyze the application of a discontinuous Galerkin
(DG) method, a finite element method that includes features of the finite
volume framework, to the EEG forward problem. The DG-FEM approach fulfills the
conservation property of electric charge also in the discrete case, making it
attractive for a variety of applications. Furthermore, as we show, this
approach can alleviate modeling inaccuracies that might occur in head
geometries when using classical FE methods, e.g., so-called ""skull leakage
effects"", which may occur in areas where the thickness of the skull is in the
range of the mesh resolution. Therefore, we derive a DG formulation of the FEM
subtraction approach for the EEG forward problem and present numerical results
that highlight the advantageous features and the potential benefits of the
proposed approach.

1511.04997	q-bio	q-bio.GN	"Rare recombination events generate sequence diversity among balancer
  chromosomes in Drosophila melanogaster"	"  Multiply inverted balancer chromosomes that suppress exchange with their
homologs are an essential part of the genetic toolkit in Drosophila
melanogaster. Despite their widespread use, the organization of balancer
chromosomes has not been characterized at the molecular level, and the degree
of sequence variation among copies of any given balancer chromosome is unknown.
To map inversion breakpoints and study potential sequence diversity in the
descendants of a structurally identical balancer chromosome, we sequenced a
panel of laboratory stocks containing the most widely used X-chromosome
balancer, First Multiple 7 (FM7). We mapped the locations of FM7 breakpoints to
precise euchromatic coordinates and identified the flanking sequence of
breakpoints in heterochromatic regions. Analysis of SNP variation revealed
megabase-scale blocks of sequence divergence among currently used FM7 stocks.
We present evidence that this divergence arose by rare double crossover events
that replaced a female-sterile allele of the singed gene (sn[X2]) on FM7c with
wild type sequence from balanced chromosomes, and propose that many FM7c
chromosomes in the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center have lost sn[X2] by this
mechanism. Finally, we characterize the original allele of the Bar gene (B[1])
that is carried on FM7 and validate the hypothesis that the origin and
subsequent reversion of the B1 duplication is mediated by unequal exchange. Our
results reject a simple non-recombining, clonal mode for the laboratory
evolution of balancer chromosomes and have implications for how balancer
chromosomes should be used in the design and interpretation of genetic
experiments in Drosophila.

self-organize in highly ordered collective states that share striking
similarities with the thermodynamic equilibrium phases of conventional
condensed matter and fluid systems. Examples range from the liquid-crystal-like
arrangements of bacterial colonies, microbial suspensions and tissues to the
coherent macro-scale dynamics in schools of fish and flocks of birds. Yet, the
generic mathematical principles that govern the emergence of structure in such
artificial and biological systems are elusive. It is not clear when, or even
whether, well-established theoretical concepts describing universal
thermostatistics of equilibrium systems can capture and classify ordered states
of living matter. Here, we connect these two previously disparate regimes:
Through microfluidic experiments and mathematical modelling, we demonstrate
that lattices of hydrodynamically coupled bacterial vortices can spontaneously
organize into distinct phases of ferro- and antiferromagnetic order. The
preferred phase can be controlled by tuning the vortex coupling through changes
of the inter-cavity gap widths. The emergence of opposing order regimes is
tightly linked to the existence of geometry-induced edge currents, reminiscent
of those in quantum systems. Our experimental observations can be rationalized
in terms of a generic lattice field theory, suggesting that bacterial spin
networks belong to the same universality class as a wide range of equilibrium
systems.

  Empirical Bayes Approach"	"  MEG/EEG are non-invasive imaging techniques that record brain activity with
high temporal resolution. However, estimation of brain source currents from
surface recordings requires solving an ill-posed inverse problem. Converging
lines of evidence in neuroscience, from neuronal network models to
resting-state imaging and neurophysiology, suggest that cortical activation is
a distributed spatiotemporal dynamic process, supported by both local and
long-distance neuroanatomic connections. Because spatiotemporal dynamics of
this kind are central to brain physiology, inverse solutions could be improved
by incorporating models of these dynamics. In this article, we present a model
for cortical activity based on nearest-neighbor autoregression that
incorporates local spatiotemporal interactions between distributed sources in a
manner consistent with neurophysiology and neuroanatomy. We develop a dynamic
Maximum a Posteriori Expectation-Maximization (dMAP-EM) source localization
algorithm for estimation of cortical sources and model parameters based on the
Kalman Filter, the Fixed Interval Smoother, and the EM algorithms. We apply the
dMAP-EM algorithm to simulated experiments as well as to human experimental
data. Furthermore, we derive expressions to relate our dynamic estimation
formulas to those of standard static models, and show how dynamic methods
optimally assimilate past and future data. Our results establish the
feasibility of spatiotemporal dynamic estimation in large-scale distributed
source spaces with several thousand source locations and hundreds of sensors,
with resulting inverse solutions that provide substantial performance
improvements over static methods.

on a two-dimensional square lattice with periodic boundary conditions. If the
(local) prey carrying capacity is finite, there exists an extinction threshold
for the predator population that separates a stable active two-species
coexistence phase from an inactive state wherein only prey survive. Holding all
other rates fixed, we investigate the non-equilibrium relaxation of the
predator density in the vicinity of the critical predation rate. As expected,
we observe critical slowing-down, i.e., a power law dependence of the
relaxation time on the predation rate, and algebraic decay of the predator
density at the extinction critical point. The numerically determined critical
exponents are in accord with the established values of the directed percolation
universality class. Following a sudden predation rate change to its critical
value, one finds critical aging for the predator density autocorrelation
function that is also governed by universal scaling exponents. This aging
scaling signature of the active-to-absorbing state phase transition emerges at
significantly earlier times than the stationary critical power laws, and could
thus serve as an advanced indicator of the (predator) population's proximity to
its extinction threshold.

also beneficial for the functioning of a variety of systems. We here consider
an adaptive network of oscillators with a stochastic, fitness-based, rule of
connectivity, and show that it self-organizes from fragmented and incoherent
states to connected and synchronized ones. The synchronization and percolation
are associated to abrupt transitions, and they are concurrently (and
significantly) enhanced as compared to the non-adaptive case. Finally we
provide evidence that only partial adaptation is sufficient to determine these
enhancements. Our study, therefore, indicates that inclusion of simple adaptive
mechanisms can efficiently describe some emergent features of networked
systems' collective behaviors, and suggests also self-organized ways to control
synchronization and percolation in natural and social systems.

billion bases in amoeba. This remarkable variation in genome size is the
outcome of complex interactions between various evolutionary factors such as
point mutation rate, population size, insertions and deletions, and genome
editing mechanisms that may be specific to certain taxonomic lineages. While
comparative genomics analyses have uncovered some of the relationships between
these diverse evolutionary factors, we still do not understand what drives
genome size evolution. Specifically, it is not clear how primordial mutational
processes of base substitutions, insertions, and deletions influence genome
size evolution in asexual organisms. Here, we use digital evolution to
investigate genome size evolution by tracking genome edits and their fitness
effects in real time. In agreement with empirical data, we find that mutation
rate is inversely correlated with genome size in asexual populations. We show
that at low point mutation rate, insertions are significantly more beneficial
than deletions, driving genome expansion and acquisition of phenotypic
complexity. Conversely, high mutational load experienced at high mutation rates
inhibits genome growth, forcing the genomes to compress genetic information.
Our analyses suggest that the inverse relationship between mutation rate and
genome size is a result of the tradeoff between evolving phenotypic innovation
and limiting the mutational load.

of a colony. A great deal of experimental and theoretical work has been done
toward gaining a clear understanding of the evolution of, and underlying

modeling. Here we continue this tradition by developing a mathematical model
for a particular aspect of task allocation, known as age-related repertoire
expansion, that has been observed in the minor workers of the ant species
\emph{Pheidole dentata}. In fact, we present a relatively broad mathematical
modeling framework based on the dynamics of the frequency with which members of
specific age groups carry out distinct tasks. We apply our modeling approach to
a specific task allocation scenario, and compare our theoretical results with
experimental data. It is observed that the model predicts perceived behavior,

we introduce a simple biophysical model where interphase chromosomes are
described in terms of the folding of chromatin sequences composed of
alternating blocks of fibers with different thicknesses and flexibilities, and
we use it to study the influence of sequence disorder on chromosome behaviors
in space and time. By employing extensive computer simulations,we thus
demonstrate that chromosomes undergo noticeable conformational changes only on
length-scales smaller than $10^5$ basepairs and time-scales shorter than a few
seconds, and we suggest there might exist effective upper bounds to the
detection of chromosome reorganization in eukaryotes. We prove the relevance of
our framework by modeling recent experimental FISH data on murine chromosomes.

  oxygenation imaging deep in tissues"	"  Light propagating in tissue attains a spectrum that varies with location due
to wavelength-dependent fluence attenuation by tissue optical properties, an
effect that causes spectral corruption. Predictions of the spectral variations
of light fluence in tissue are challenging since the spatial distribution of
optical properties in tissue cannot be resolved in high resolution or with high
accuracy by current methods. Spectral corruption has fundamentally limited the
quantification accuracy of optical and optoacoustic methods and impeded the
long sought-after goal of imaging blood oxygen saturation (sO2) deep in
tissues; a critical but still unattainable target for the assessment of
oxygenation in physiological processes and disease. We discover a new principle
underlying light fluence in tissues, which describes the wavelength dependence
of light fluence as an affine function of a few reference base spectra,
independently of the specific distribution of tissue optical properties. This
finding enables the introduction of a previously undocumented concept termed
eigenspectra Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (eMSOT) that can effectively
account for wavelength dependent light attenuation without explicit knowledge
of the tissue optical properties. We validate eMSOT in more than 2000
simulations and with phantom and animal measurements. We find that eMSOT can
quantitatively image tissue sO2 reaching in many occasions a better than
10-fold improved accuracy over conventional spectral optoacoustic methods.
Then, we show that eMSOT can spatially resolve sO2 in muscle and tumor;
revealing so far unattainable tissue physiology patterns. Last, we related
eMSOT readings to cancer hypoxia and found congruence between eMSOT tumor sO2
images and tissue perfusion and hypoxia maps obtained by correlative
histological analysis.

Cahn--Hilliard equation with source terms coupled to a reaction-diffusion
equation. The coupled system of partial differential equations models a tumour
growing in the presence of a nutrient species and surrounded by healthy tissue.
The model also takes into account transport mechanisms such as chemotaxis and

  resting-state functional brain networks"	"  We investigate the relationship of resting-state fMRI functional connectivity
estimated over long periods of time with time-varying functional connectivity
estimated over shorter time intervals. We show that using Pearson's correlation
to estimate functional connectivity implies that the range of fluctuations of
functional connections over short time scales is subject to statistical
constraints imposed by their connectivity strength over longer scales. We
present a method for estimating time-varying functional connectivity that is
designed to mitigate this issue and allows us to identify episodes where
functional connections are unexpectedly strong or weak. We apply this method to
data recorded from $N=80$ participants, and show that the number of
unexpectedly strong/weak connections fluctuates over time, and that these
variations coincide with intermittent periods of high and low modularity in
time-varying functional connectivity. We also find that during periods of
relative quiescence regions associated with default mode network tend to join
communities with attentional, control, and primary sensory systems. In
contrast, during periods where many connections are unexpectedly strong/weak,
default mode regions dissociate and form distinct modules. Finally, we go on to
show that, while all functional connections can at times manifest stronger
(more positively correlated) or weaker (more negatively correlated) than
expected, a small number of connections, mostly within the visual and
somatomotor networks, do so a disproportional number of times. Our statistical
approach allows the detection of functional connections that fluctuate more or
less than expected based on their long-time averages and may be of use in
future studies characterizing the spatio-temporal patterns of time-varying
functional connectivity

  Networks"	"  The ability to predict future states of the environment is a central pillar
of intelligence. At its core, effective prediction requires an internal model
of the world and an understanding of the rules by which the world changes.
Here, we explore the internal models developed by deep neural networks trained
using a loss based on predicting future frames in synthetic video sequences,
using a CNN-LSTM-deCNN framework. We first show that this architecture can
achieve excellent performance in visual sequence prediction tasks, including
state-of-the-art performance in a standard 'bouncing balls' dataset (Sutskever
et al., 2009). Using a weighted mean-squared error and adversarial loss
(Goodfellow et al., 2014), the same architecture successfully extrapolates
out-of-the-plane rotations of computer-generated faces. Furthermore, despite
being trained end-to-end to predict only pixel-level information, our
Predictive Generative Networks learn a representation of the latent structure
of the underlying three-dimensional objects themselves. Importantly, we find
that this representation is naturally tolerant to object transformations, and
generalizes well to new tasks, such as classification of static images. Similar
models trained solely with a reconstruction loss fail to generalize as
effectively. We argue that prediction can serve as a powerful unsupervised loss
for learning rich internal representations of high-level object features.

public availability and reproducibility of experimental data. Standards for
data preservation and exchange are central to addressing this challenge: the
Investigation-Study-Assay Tabular (ISA-Tab) project has developed a widely used
template for such standards in biological research. This paper describes the
application of ISA-Tab to protein titration data. Despite the importance of
titration experiments for understanding protein structure, stability, and
function and for testing computational approaches to protein electrostatics, no
such mechanism currently exists for sharing and preserving biomolecular
titration data. We have adapted the ISA-Tab template to provide a structured
means of supporting experimental structural chemistry data with a particular
emphasis on the calculation and measurement of pKa values. This activity has
been performed as part of the broader pKa Cooperative effort, leveraging data
that has been collected and curated by the Cooperative members. In this

broad range of pKa and electrostatics data obtained for multiple protein
systems. The resulting curated data is publicly available at

models of biomolecular systems. As bond graphs have been widely used to model,
analyse and synthesise engineering systems, this paper suggests that they can
play the same role in the modelling, analysis and synthesis of biomolecular
systems. The particular structure of bond graphs arising from biomolecular
systems is established and used to elucidate the relation between
thermodynamically closed and open systems. Block diagram representations of the
dynamics implied by these bond graphs are used to reveal implicit feedback
structures and are linearised to allow the application of control-theoretical
methods.
  Two concepts of modularity are examined: computational modularity where
physical correctness is retained and behavioural modularity where module
behaviour (such as ultrasensitivity) is retained. As well as providing
computational modularity, bond graphs provide a natural formulation of
behavioural modularity and reveal the sources of retroactivity. A bond graph
approach to reducing retroactivity, and thus inter-module interaction, is shown
to require a power supply such as that provided by the ATP = ADP + Pi reaction.
  The MAPK cascade (Raf-MEK-ERK pathway) is used as an illustrative example.

obtained from a hospital patient or an evironmental source has become possible
after recent technological advances in DNA sequencing. For several applications
it is important to accurately identify the presence and estimate relative
abundances of the target organisms from short sequence reads obtained from a
sample. This task is particularly challenging when the set of interest includes
very closely related organisms, such as different strains of pathogenic
bacteria, which can vary considerably in terms of virulence, resistance and
spread. Using advanced Bayesian statistical modelling and computation
techniques we introduce a novel pipeline for bacterial identification that is
shown to outperform the currently leading pipeline for this purpose. Our
approach enables fast and accurate sequence-based identification of bacterial
strains while using only modest computational resources. Hence it provides a
useful tool for a wide spectrum of applications, including rapid clinical
diagnostics to distinguish among closely related strains causing nosocomial
infections. The software implementation is available at

minimizing the unfavourable interactions between hydrophobic residues and water
through the formation of a hydrophobic core. Here we include the entropic and
enthalpic contributions of the hydrophobic effect explicitly in an implicit

  simple model for the collective activity of striatal projection neurons"	"  Striatal projection neurons form a sparsely-connected inhibitory network, and
this arrangement may be essential for the appropriate temporal organization of
behavior. Here we show that a simplified, sparse inhibitory network of
Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire neurons can reproduce some key features of striatal
population activity, as observed in brain slices [Carrillo-Reid et al., J.
Neurophysiology 99 (2008) 1435{1450]. In particular we develop a new metric to
determine the conditions under which sparse inhibitory networks form
anti-correlated cell assemblies with time-varying activity of individual cells.
We found that under these conditions the network displays an input-specific
sequence of cell assembly switching, that effectively discriminates similar
inputs. Our results support the proposal [Ponzi and Wickens, PLoS Comp Biol 9
(2013) e1002954] that GABAergic connections between striatal projection neurons
allow stimulus-selective, temporally-extended sequential activation of cell
assemblies. Furthermore, we help to show how altered intrastriatal GABAergic
signaling may produce aberrant network-level information processing in
disorders such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases.

there is no general agreement about principles that govern its organization.
Based on extensive quantitative data we tested the power of three models to
predict connections of the primate cerebral cortex: architectonic similarity
(structural model), spatial proximity (distance model) and thickness similarity
(thickness model). Architectonic similarity showed the strongest and most
consistent influence on connection features. This parameter was strongly
associated with the presence or absence of inter-areal connections and when
integrated with spatial distance, the model allowed predicting the existence of
projections with very high accuracy. Moreover, architectonic similarity was
strongly related to the laminar pattern of projections origins, and the
absolute number of cortical connections of an area. By contrast, cortical
thickness similarity and distance were not systematically related to connection
features. These findings suggest that cortical architecture provides a general
organizing principle for connections in the primate brain.

give rise to counter-intuitive phenomena. In this paper we shortly review noise
induced effects in different ecosystems, in which two populations compete for
the same resources. We also present new results on spatial patterns of two
populations, while modeling real distributions of anchovies and sardines. The
transient dynamics of these ecosystems are analyzed through generalized
Lotka-Volterra equations in the presence of multiplicative noise, which models
the interaction between the species and the environment. We find noise induced
phenomena such as quasi-deterministic oscillations, stochastic resonance, noise
delayed extinction, and noise induced pattern formation. In addition, our
theoretical results are validated with experimental findings. Specifically the
results, obtained by a coupled map lattice model, well reproduce the spatial
distributions of anchovies and sardines, observed in a marine ecosystem.
Moreover, the experimental dynamical behavior of two competing bacterial
populations in a meat product and the probability distribution at long times of
one of them are well reproduced by a stochastic microbial predictive model.

this we scrutinise col- lective many-atom motions during all-atom molecular
dynamics simulations. We introduce, develop and employ various topological
techniques, in combination with analytic tools that we deduce from the concept
of integrable models and structure of discrete nonlinear Schroedinger equation.
The example we consider is an alpha-helical subunit of the HIV envelope
glycoprotein gp41. The helical structure is stable when the subunit is part of
the biological oligomer. But in isolation the helix becomes unstable, and the
monomer starts deforming. We follow the process computationally. We interpret
the evolving structure both in terms of a backbone based Heisenberg spin chain
and in terms of a side chain based XY spin chain. We find that in both cases
the formation of protein super-secondary structure is akin the formation of a
topological Bloch domain wall along a spin chain. During the process we
identify three individual Bloch walls and we show that each of them can be
modelled with a very high precision in terms of a soliton solution to a
discrete nonlinear Schroedinger equation.

The active motion of the axoneme, the motile structure inside cilia and
flagella, is powered by molecular motors of the dynein family. These motors
generate forces and torques that slide and bend the microtubule doublets within
the axoneme. To create regular waveforms the activities of the dyneins must be
coordinated. It is thought that coordination is mediated by stresses due to
radial, transverse, or sliding deformations, that build up within the moving
axoneme. However, which particular component of the stress regulates the motors
to produce the observed flagellar waveforms remains an open question. To
address this question, we describe the axoneme as a three-dimensional bundle of
filaments and characterize its mechanics. We show that regulation of the motors
by radial and transverse stresses can lead to a coordinated flagellar motion
only in the presence of twist. By comparison, regulation by shear stress is
possible without twist. We calculate emergent beating patterns in twisted
axonemes resulting from regulation by transverse stresses. The waveforms are
similar to those observed in flagella of Chlamydomonas and sperm. Due to the
twist, the waveform has non-planar components, which result in swimming
trajectories such as twisted ribbons and helices that agree with observations.

  network identifies disease genes and drug targets"	"  The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network is crucial for cellular
information processing and decision-making. With suitable inputs, PPI networks
drive the cells to diverse functional outcomes such as cell proliferation or
cell death. Here we characterize the structural controllability of a large
directed human PPI network comprised of 6,339 proteins and 34,813 interactions.
This allows us to classify proteins as ""indispensable"", ""neutral"" or
""dispensable"", which correlates to increasing, no effect, or decreasing the
number of driver nodes in the network upon removal of that protein. We find
that 21% of the proteins in the PPI network are indispensable. Interestingly,
these indispensable proteins are the primary targets of disease-causing
mutations, human viruses, and drugs, suggesting that altering a network's
control property is critical for the transition between healthy and disease
states. Furthermore, analyzing copy number alterations data from 1,547 cancer
patients reveals that 56 genes that are frequently amplified or deleted in nine
different cancers are indispensable. Among the 56 genes, 46 of them have not
been previously associated with cancer. This suggests that controllability
analysis is very useful in identifying novel disease genes and potential drug
targets.

such methods to real-time brain imaging is the need for adequate stopping
criteria, an aspect of Bayesian optimization which has received limited
attention. In light of high scanning costs and limited attentional capacities
of subjects an accurate and reliable stopping criteria is essential. In order
to address this issue we propose and empirically study the performance of two
stopping criteria.

unknowns in modern science. Only one example of life exists--one that proceeded
from a single self-replicating organism (or a set of replicating hyper-cycles)
to the vast complexity we see today in Earth's biosphere. We know that emergent
life has the potential to evolve great increases in complexity, but it is
unknown if evolvability is automatic given any self-replicating organism. At
the same time, it is difficult to test such questions in biochemical systems.
Laboratory studies with RNA replicators have had some success with exploring
the capacities of simple self-replicators, but these experiments are still
limited in both capabilities and scope. Here, we use the digital evolution
system Avida to explore the interaction between emergent replicators (rare
randomly-assembled self-replicators) and evolvability. We find that we can
classify fixed-length emergent replicators in Avida into two classes based on
functional analysis. One class is more evolvable in the sense of optimizing
their replication abilities. However, the other class is more evolvable in the
sense of acquiring evolutionary innovations. We tie this trade-off in
evolvability to the structure of the respective classes' replication machinery,
and speculate on the relevance of these results to biochemical replicators.

to solve cognitive tasks. Despite their success, GAs sometimes fail to locate
the highest peaks of the fitness landscape, in particular if the landscape is
rugged and contains multiple peaks. Reaching distant and higher peaks is
difficult because valleys need to be crossed, in a process that (at least
temporarily) runs against the fitness maximization objective. Here we propose
and test a number of information-theoretic (as well as network-based) measures
that can be used in conjunction with a fitness maximization objective
(so-called ``neuro-correlates"") to evolve neural controllers for two widely
different tasks: a behavioral task that requires information integration, and a
cognitive task that requires memory and logic. We find that judiciously chosen
neuro-correlates can significantly aid GAs to find the highest peaks.

at least for most of the protein targets in the focus of biomedical research.
Perhaps the most successful strategy to overcome the inefficiency problem is
multiscale modeling to merge all-atom and coarse-grained models. This chapter
describes a well-established CABS coarse-grained protein model. The CABS
(C-Alpha, C-Beta and Side chains) model assumes a 2-4 united-atom
representation of amino acids, knowledge-based force field (derived from the
statistical regularities seen in known protein sequences and structures) and
efficient Monte Carlo sampling schemes (MC dynamics, MC replica-exchange, and
combinations). A particular emphasis is given to the unique design of the CABS
force-field, which is largely defined using one-dimensional structural
properties of proteins, including protein secondary structure. This chapter
also presents CABS-based modeling methods, including multiscale tools for de
novo structure prediction, modeling of protein dynamics and prediction of
protein-peptide complexes. CABS-based tools are freely available at

connection with the role of such dinucleotide in DNA methylation. While the CG
distributions of mammals exhibit exponential tails with comparable parameters,
the picture for the other organisms studied (e.g., fish, insects, bacteria and

process introduced by Armbruster and Beck (2016) to the SIR process, we show
convergence using only a system of three ODEs, simple probabilistic
inequalities, and basic ODE theory. Our approach can also be generalized to

for asymmetric shares of diversification rates (or diversification `potential')

as the addition of extinction to the model in a natural way. We describe the
incremental evolutionary construction of a tree with n leaves by splitting or

asymmetric roles to the first and second offspring species of a given species
and keeping track of the order of the speciation events occurring during the
creation of the tree, unranked planar trees, ranked non-planar trees and
finally (unranked non-planar) trees. We also describe a continuous-time

we introduce a mathematical framework to compare the long-term adaptation of

the immune strategy that they adopt. We find that the two key determinants of
an optimal immune strategy are the frequency and the characteristic timescale

computer system has been able to reach human levels of performance so far. The
only known computational system capable of proper language processing is the
human brain. While we gather more and more data about the brain, its
fundamental computational processes still remain obscure. The lack of a sound
computational brain theory also prevents the fundamental understanding of
Natural Language Processing. As always when science lacks a theoretical
foundation, statistical modeling is applied to accommodate as many sampled
real-world data as possible. An unsolved fundamental issue is the actual
representation of language (data) within the brain, denoted as the
Representational Problem. Starting with Jeff Hawkins' Hierarchical Temporal
Memory (HTM) theory, a consistent computational theory of the human cortex, we
have developed a corresponding theory of language data representation: The
Semantic Folding Theory. The process of encoding words, by using a topographic
semantic space as distributional reference frame into a sparse binary
representational vector is called Semantic Folding and is the central topic of
this document. Semantic Folding describes a method of converting language from
its symbolic representation (text) into an explicit, semantically grounded
representation that can be generically processed by Hawkins' HTM networks. As
it turned out, this change in representation, by itself, can solve many complex
NLP problems by applying Boolean operators and a generic similarity function
like the Euclidian Distance. Many practical problems of statistical NLP
systems, like the high cost of computation, the fundamental incongruity of
precision and recall , the complex tuning procedures etc., can be elegantly
overcome by applying Semantic Folding.

processes such as selection, drift, and immigration give rise to observed
patterns in species composition and diversity. Here, we present a simple,
analytically tractable, presence-absence (PA) model for community assembly and
use it to ask how ecological traits such as the strength of competition, the
amount of diversity, and demographic and environmental stochasticity affect
species composition in a community. In the PA model, species are treated as
stochastic binary variables that can either be present or absent in a
community: species can immigrate into the community from a regional species
pool and can go extinct due to competition and stochasticity. Despite its
simplicity, the PA model reproduces the qualitative features of more
complicated models of community assembly. In agreement with recent work on
large, competitive Lotka-Volterra systems, the PA model exhibits distinct
ecological behaviors organized around a special (""critical"") point
corresponding to Hubbell's neutral theory of biodiversity. These results
suggest that the concepts of ecological ""phases"" and phase diagrams can provide
a powerful framework for thinking about community ecology and that the PA model
captures the essential ecological dynamics of community assembly.

  Networks"	"  To make sense of the world our brains must analyze high-dimensional datasets
streamed by our sensory organs. Because such analysis begins with
dimensionality reduction, modelling early sensory processing requires
biologically plausible online dimensionality reduction algorithms. Recently, we
derived such an algorithm, termed similarity matching, from a Multidimensional
Scaling (MDS) objective function. However, in the existing algorithm, the
number of output dimensions is set a priori by the number of output neurons and
cannot be changed. Because the number of informative dimensions in sensory
inputs is variable there is a need for adaptive dimensionality reduction. Here,
we derive biologically plausible dimensionality reduction algorithms which
adapt the number of output dimensions to the eigenspectrum of the input
covariance matrix. We formulate three objective functions which, in the offline
setting, are optimized by the projections of the input dataset onto its
principal subspace scaled by the eigenvalues of the output covariance matrix.
In turn, the output eigenvalues are computed as i) soft-thresholded, ii)
hard-thresholded, iii) equalized thresholded eigenvalues of the input
covariance matrix. In the online setting, we derive the three corresponding
adaptive algorithms and map them onto the dynamics of neuronal activity in
networks with biologically plausible local learning rules. Remarkably, in the
last two networks, neurons are divided into two classes which we identify with
principal neurons and interneurons in biological circuits.

whitening which maximize information transmission in the presence of noise. We
adopt the similarity matching framework, recently developed for principal

traditionally defined for signals supported on regular domains such as discrete

and defines brain graph frequencies associated with different levels of spatial
smoothness across the brain regions. Brain network frequency also enables the
decomposition of brain signals into pieces corresponding to smooth or rapid

the networks of interest denote functional connectivity. The methods are
utilized to analyze brain networks and signals as subjects master a simple
motor skill. We observe that brain signals corresponding to different graph

Further, we notice a strong association between graph spectral properties of

mode can be decomposed into a sum of elementary modes. However, only a
decomposition without cancelations is biochemically meaningful, since a
reversible reaction cannot have different directions in the contributing
elementary modes. This essential requirement has been largely overlooked by the
metabolic pathway community.
  Indeed, every flux mode can be decomposed into elementary modes without
cancelations. The result is an immediate consequence of a theorem by
Rockafellar which states that every element of a linear subspace is a conformal
sum (a sum without cancelations) of elementary vectors (support-minimal
vectors). In this work, we extend the theorem, first to ""subspace cones"" and
then to general polyhedral cones and polyhedra. Thereby, we refine Minkowski's
and Carath\'eodory's theorems, two fundamental results in polyhedral geometry.
We note that, in general, elementary vectors need not be support-minimal, in
fact, they are conformally non-decomposable and form a unique minimal set of
conformal generators.
  Our treatment is mathematically rigorous, but suitable for systems
biologists, since we give self-contained proofs for our results and use
concepts motivated by metabolic pathway analysis. In particular, we study cones
defined by linear subspaces and nonnegativity conditions - like the flux cone -
and use them to analyze general polyhedral cones and polyhedra.
  Finally, we review applications of elementary vectors and conformal sums in
metabolic pathway analysis.

  of chromatin assortativity"	"  Network analysis is a powerful way of modeling chromatin interactions.
Assortativity is a network property used in social sciences to identify factors
affecting how people establish social ties. We propose a new approach, using
chromatin assortativity to integrate the epigenomic landscape of a specific
cell type with its chromatin interaction network and thus investigate which
proteins or chromatin marks mediate genomic contacts. We use high-resolution
Promoter Capture Hi-C and Hi-Cap data as well as ChIA-PET data from mouse
embryonic stem cells to investigate promoter-centered chromatin interaction
networks and calculate the presence of specific epigenomic features in the
chromatin fragments constituting the nodes of the network. We estimate the
association of these features to the topology of four chromatin interaction
networks and identify features localized in connected areas of the network.
Polycomb Group proteins and associated histone marks are the features with the
highest chromatin assortativity in promoter-centred networks. We then ask which
features distinguish contacts amongst promoters from contacts between promoters
and other genomic elements. We observe higher chromatin assortativity of the
actively elongating form of RNA Polymerase 2 (RNAPII) compared to inactive
forms only in interactions between promoters and other elements. Contacts among
promoters, and between promoters and other elements have different
characteristic epigenomic features. We identify a possible role for the
elongating form of RNAPII in mediating interactions among promoters, enhancers
and transcribed gene bodies. Our approach facilitates the study of multiple
genome-wide epigenomic profiles, considering network topology and allowing the
comparison of chromatin interaction networks.

of available training data, the statistical distribution of this data, however,
varies across subjects as well as across sessions within individual subjects,
limiting the transferability of training data or trained models between them.
In this article, we review current transfer learning techniques in BCIs that
exploit shared structure between training data of multiple subjects and/or
sessions to increase performance. We then present a framework for transfer
learning in the context of BCIs that can be applied to any arbitrary feature
space, as well as a novel regression estimation method that is specifically
designed for the structure of a system based on the electroencephalogram (EEG).
We demonstrate the utility of our framework and method on subject-to-subject
transfer in a motor-imagery paradigm as well as on session-to-session transfer
in one patient diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), showing that
it is able to outperform other comparable methods on an identical dataset.

  of the initial phase"	"  This paper is concerned with stochastic SIR and SEIR epidemic models on
random networks in which individuals may rewire away from infected neighbors at
some rate $\omega$ (and reconnect to non-infectious individuals with
probability $\alpha$ or else simply drop the edge if $\alpha=0$), so-called
preventive rewiring. The models are denoted SIR-$\omega$ and SEIR-$\omega$, and
we focus attention on the early stages of an outbreak, where we derive
expression for the basic reproduction number $R_0$ and the expected degree of
the infectious nodes $E(D_I)$ using two different approximation approaches. The
first approach approximates the early spread of an epidemic by a branching
process, whereas the second one uses pair approximation. The expressions are
compared with the corresponding empirical means obtained from stochastic
simulations of SIR-$\omega$ and SEIR-$\omega$ epidemics on Poisson and
scale-free networks. Without rewiring of exposed nodes, the two approaches
predict the same epidemic threshold and the same $E(D_I)$ for both types of
epidemics, the latter being very close to the mean degree obtained from
simulated epidemics over Poisson networks. Above the epidemic threshold,
pairwise models overestimate the value of $R_0$ computed from simulations,
which turns out to be very close to the one predicted by the branching process
approximation. When exposed individuals also rewire with $\alpha > 0$ (perhaps
unaware of being infected), the two approaches give different epidemic
thresholds, with the branching process approximation being more in agreement
with simulations.

by chemical cues. Viewing metastasis in this way, as a physical phenomenon,
allows one to draw upon insights from other studies of collective sensing and
migration in cell biology. Here we review recent progress in the study of cell
sensing and migration as collective phenomena, including in the context of
metastatic cells. We describe simple physical models that yield the limits to
the precision of cell sensing, and we review experimental evidence that cells
operate near these limits. Models of collective migration are surveyed in order
understand how collective metastatic invasion can occur. We conclude by
contrasting cells' sensory abilities with their sensitivity to drugs, and
suggesting potential alternatives to cell-death-based cancer therapies.

  amplification, and co-attraction in collective guidance"	"  Single eukaryotic cells commonly sense and follow chemical gradients,
performing chemotaxis. Recent experiments and theories, however, show that even
when single cells do not chemotax, clusters of cells may, if their interactions
are regulated by the chemoattractant. We study this general mechanism of
""collective guidance"" computationally with models that integrate stochastic
dynamics for individual cells with biochemical reactions within the cells, and
diffusion of chemical signals between the cells. We show that if clusters of
cells use the well-known local excitation, global inhibition (LEGI) mechanism
to sense chemoattractant gradients, the speed of the cell cluster becomes
non-monotonic in the cluster's size - clusters either larger or smaller than an
optimal size will have lower speed. We argue that the cell cluster speed is a
crucial readout of how the cluster processes chemotactic signal; both
amplification and adaptation will alter the behavior of cluster speed as a
function of size. We also show that, contrary to the assumptions of earlier
theories, collective guidance does not require persistent cell-cell contacts
and strong short range adhesion to function. If cell-cell adhesion is absent,
and the cluster cohesion is instead provided by a co-attraction mechanism, e.g.
chemotaxis toward a secreted molecule, collective guidance may still function.
However, new behaviors, such as cluster rotation, may also appear in this case.
Together, the combination of co-attraction and adaptation allows for collective
guidance that is robust to varying chemoattractant concentrations while not
requiring strong cell-cell adhesion.

  Networks and Lattices"	"  We study the spreading of two mutually cooperative diseases on different
network topologies, and with two microscopic realizations, both of which are
stochastic versions of an SIR type model studied by us recently in mean field
approximation. There it had been found that cooperativity can lead to
first-order spreading/extinction transitions. However, due to the rapid mixing
implied by the mean field assumption, first order transitions required non-zero
initial densities of sick individuals. For the stochastic model studied here
the results depend strongly on the underlying network. First order transitions
are found when there are few short but many long loops: (i) No first order
transitions exist on trees and on 2-d lattices with local contacts (ii) They do
exist on Erdos-Renyi (ER) networks, on d-dimensional lattices with d >= 4, and
on 2-d lattices with sufficiently long-ranged contacts; (iii) On 3-d lattices
with local contacts the results depend on the microscopic details of the
implementation; (iv) While single infected seeds can always lead to infinite
epidemics on regular lattices, on ER networks one sometimes needs finite
initial densities of infected nodes; (v) In all cases the first order
transitions are actually ""hybrid"", i.e. they display also power law scaling
usually associated with second order transitions. On regular lattices, our
model can also be interpreted as the growth of an interface due to cooperative
attachment of two species of particles. Critically pinned interfaces in this
model seem to be in different universality classes than standard critically
pinned interfaces in models with forbidden overhangs. Finally, the detailed
results mentioned above hold only when both diseases propagate along the same
network of links. If they use different links, results can be rather different
in detail, but are similar overall.

1512.00695	q-bio	q-bio.MN	"The Limiting Dynamics of a Bistable Molecular Switch With and Without
  Noise"	"  We consider the dynamics of a population of organisms containing two mutually
inhibitory gene regulatory networks, that can result in a bistable switch-like
behaviour. We completely characterize their local and global dynamics in the
absence of any noise, and then go on to consider the effects of either noise
coming from bursting (transcription or translation), or Gaussian noise in
molecular degradation rates when there is a dominant slow variable in the
system. We show analytically how the steady state distribution in the
population can range from a single unimodal distribution through a bimodal
distribution and give the explicit analytic form for the invariant stationary
density which is globally asymptotically stable. Rather remarkably, the
behaviour of the stationary density with respect to the parameters
characterizing the molecular behaviour of the bistable switch is qualitatively
identical in the presence of noise coming from bursting as well as in the
presence of Gaussian noise in the degradation rate. This implies that one
cannot distinguish between either the dominant source or nature of noise based
on the stationary molecular distribution in a population of cells. We finally
show that the switch model with bursting but two dominant slow genes has an
asymptotically stable stationary density.

1512.00769	q-bio	nlin.CG cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.PE	"Three is much more than two in coarsening dynamics of cyclic
  competitions"	"  The classical game of rock-paper-scissors have inspired experiments and
spatial model systems that address robustness of biological diversity. In
particular the game nicely illustrates that cyclic interactions allow multiple
strategies to coexist for long time intervals. When formulated in terms of a
one-dimensional cellular automata, the spatial distribution of strategies
exhibits coarsening with algebraically growing domain size over time, while the
two-dimensional version allows domains to break and thereby opens for long-time
coexistence. We here consider a quasi-one-dimensional implementation of the
cyclic competition, and study the long-term dynamics as a function of rare
invasions between parallel linear ecosystems. We find that increasing the
complexity from two to three parallel subsystems allows a transition from
complete coarsening to an active steady state where the domain size stays
finite. We further find that this transition happens irrespective of whether
the update is done in parallel for all sites simultaneously, or done randomly
in sequential order. In both cases the active state is characterized by
localized bursts of dislocations, followed by longer periods of coarsening. In
the case of the parallel dynamics, we find that there is another phase
transition between the active steady state and the coarsening state within the
three-line system when the invasion rate between the subsystems is varied. We
identify the critical parameter for this transition, and show that the density
of active boundaries have critical exponents that are consistent with the
directed percolation universality class. On the other hand, numerical
simulations with the random sequential dynamics suggest that the system may
exhibit an active steady state as long as the invasion rate is finite.

1512.00810	q-bio	q-bio.NC stat.AP	"Valid population inference for information-based imaging: From the
  second-level $t$-test to prevalence inference"	"  In multivariate pattern analysis of neuroimaging data, 'second-level'
inference is often performed by entering classification accuracies into a
$t$-test vs chance level across subjects. We argue that while the
random-effects analysis implemented by the $t$-test does provide population
inference if applied to activation differences, it fails to do so in the case
of classification accuracy or other 'information-like' measures, because the
true value of such measures can never be below chance level. This constraint
changes the meaning of the population-level null hypothesis being tested, which
becomes equivalent to the global null hypothesis that there is no effect in any
subject in the population. Consequently, rejecting it only allows to infer that
there are some subjects in which there is an information effect, but not that
it generalizes, rendering it effectively equivalent to fixed-effects analysis.
This statement is supported by theoretical arguments as well as simulations. We
review possible alternative approaches to population inference for
information-based imaging, converging on the idea that it should not target the
mean, but the prevalence of the effect in the population. One method to do so,
'permutation-based information prevalence inference using the minimum
statistic', is described in detail and applied to empirical data.

1512.00844	q-bio	q-bio.CB	Optimal Strategies for Virus Propagation	"  This paper explores a number of questions regarding optimal strategies
evolved by viruses upon entry into a vertebrate host. The infected cell life
cycle consists of a non-productively infected stage in which it is producing
virions but not releasing them and of a productively infected stage in which it
is just releasing virions. The study explores why the infected cell cycle
should be so delineated, something which is akin to a classic bang-bang control
or all-or-none principle. The times spent in each of these stages represent a
viral strategy to optimize peak viral load. Increasing the time spent in the
non-productively infected phase ({\tau}1) would lead to a concomitant increase
in peak viremia. However increasing this time would also invite a more vigorous
response from Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes (CTLs). Simultaneously, if there is a
vigorous antibody response, then we might expect {\tau}1 to be high, in order
that the virus builds up its population and conversely if there is a weak
antibody response, {\tau}1 might be small. These tradeoffs are explored using a
mathematical model of virus propagation using Ordinary Differential Equations
(ODEs). The study raises questions about whether common viruses have actually
settled into an optimum, the role for reliability and whether experimental
infections of hosts with non-endemic strains could help elicit answers about
viral progression.

  species distributions"	"  Biogeographical regions (bioregions) reveal how different sets of species are
spatially grouped and therefore are important units for conservation,
historical biogeography, ecology and evolution. Several methods have been
developed to identify bioregions based on species distribution data rather than
expert opinion. One approach successfully applies network theory to simplify
and highlight the underlying structure in species distributions. However, this
method lacks tools for simple and efficient analysis. Here we present Infomap
Bioregions, an interactive web application that inputs species distribution
data and generates bioregion maps. Species distributions may be provided as
georeferenced point occurrences or range maps, and can be of local, regional or
global scale. The application uses a novel adaptive resolution method to make
best use of often incomplete species distribution data. The results can be
downloaded as vector graphics, shapefiles or in table format. We validate the
tool by processing large datasets of publicly available species distribution
data of the world's amphibians using species ranges, and mammals using point
occurrences. We then calculate the fit between the inferred bioregions and WWF
ecoregions. As examples of applications, researchers can reconstruct ancestral
ranges in historical biogeography or identify indicator species for targeted
conservation.

1512.00897	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Pattern completion in symmetric threshold-linear networks	"  Threshold-linear networks are a common class of firing rate models that
describe recurrent interactions among neurons. Unlike their linear
counterparts, these networks generically possess multiple stable fixed points
(steady states), making them viable candidates for memory encoding and
retrieval. In this work, we characterize stable fixed points of general
threshold-linear networks with constant external drive, and discover
constraints on the co-existence of fixed points involving different subsets of
active neurons. In the case of symmetric networks, we prove the following
antichain property: if a set of neurons $\tau$ is the support of a stable fixed
point, then no proper subset or superset of $\tau$ can support a stable fixed
point. Symmetric threshold-linear networks thus appear to be well suited for
pattern completion, since the dynamics are guaranteed not to get ""stuck"" in a
subset or superset of a stored pattern. We also show that for any graph G, we
can construct a network whose stable fixed points correspond precisely to the
maximal cliques of G. As an application, we design network decoders for place
field codes, and demonstrate their efficacy for error correction and pattern
completion. The proofs of our main results build on the theory of permitted
sets in threshold-linear networks, including recently-developed connections to
classical distance geometry.

phenomena in disordered systems, with applications covering ferromagnetism,
combinatorial optimization, protein folding, stock market dynamics, and social
dynamics. The phase diagram of these systems is obtained in the thermodynamic
limit by averaging over the quenched randomness of the couplings. However, many
applications require the statistics of activity for a single realization of the
possibly asymmetric couplings in finite-sized networks. Examples include
reconstruction of couplings from the observed dynamics, learning in the central
nervous system by correlation-sensitive synaptic plasticity, and representation
of probability distributions for sampling-based inference. The systematic
cumulant expansion for kinetic binary (Ising) threshold units with strong,
random and asymmetric couplings presented here goes beyond mean-field theory
and is applicable outside thermodynamic equilibrium; a system of approximate
non-linear equations predicts average activities and pairwise covariances in
quantitative agreement with full simulations down to hundreds of units. The
linearized theory yields an expansion of the correlation- and response
functions in collective eigenmodes, leads to an efficient algorithm solving the
inverse problem, and shows that correlations are invariant under scaling of the
interaction strengths.

  Preserve the Topology and Complexity of Genetic Networks"	"  Network inference is a rapidly advancing field, with new methods being
proposed on a regular basis. Understanding the advantages and limitations of
different network inference methods is key to their effective application in
different circumstances. The common structural properties shared by diverse
networks naturally pose a challenge when it comes to devising accurate
inference methods, but surprisingly, there is a paucity of comparison and
evaluation methods. Historically, every new methodology has only been tested
against \textit{gold standard} (true values) purpose-designed synthetic and
real-world (validated) biological networks. In this paper we aim to assess the
impact of taking into consideration aspects of topological and information
content in the evaluation of the final accuracy of an inference procedure.
Specifically, we will compare the best inference methods, in both
graph-theoretic and information-theoretic terms, for preserving topological
properties and the original information content of synthetic and biological
networks. New methods for performance comparison are introduced by borrowing
ideas from gene set enrichment analysis and by applying concepts from
algorithmic complexity. Experimental results show that no individual algorithm
outperforms all others in all cases, and that the challenging and non-trivial
nature of network inference is evident in the struggle of some of the
algorithms to turn in a performance that is superior to random guesswork.
Therefore special care should be taken to suit the method to the purpose at
hand. Finally, we show that evaluations from data generated using different
underlying topologies have different signatures that can be used to better
choose a network reconstruction method.

population is isolated, intrinsic stochasticity of elemental processes can
ultimately bring it to extinction. Here we study extinction of oscillating
populations in a stochastic version of the Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey
model. To this end we extend a WKB approximation (after Wentzel, Kramers and
Brillouin) of solving the master equation to the case of extinction from a
limit cycle in the space of population sizes. We evaluate the extinction rates
and find the most probable paths to extinction by applying Floquet theory to
the dynamics of an effective WKB Hamiltonian. We show that the entropic
barriers to extinction change in a non-analytic way as the system passes
through the Hopf bifurcation. We also study the subleading pre-exponential
factors of the WKB approximation.

model selection to characterize the degree distributions of graphs containing
up to $\simeq 10^6$ nodes and $\simeq 10^8$ edges. A three-parameter
generalized Weibull (also known as a stretched exponential) distribution is a
good fit to most of the observed degree distributions. For almost all networks,
simple power laws cannot fit the data, but in some cases there is statistical
support for power laws with an exponential cutoff. We also calculate the
topological (graph) dimension $D$ and the small-world coefficient $\sigma$ of
these networks. While $\sigma$ suggests a small-world topology, we found that
$D < 4$ showing that long-distance connections provide only a small correction

  capacity: numerical results"	"  Attractor neural network is an important theoretical scenario for modeling
memory function in the hippocampus and in the cortex. In these models, memories
are stored in the plastic recurrent connections of neural populations in the
form of ""attractor states"". The maximal information capacity for conventional
abstract attractor networks with unconstrained connections is 2 bits/synapse.
However, an unconstrained synapse has the capacity to store infinite amount of
bits in a noiseless theoretical scenario: a capacity that conventional
attractor networks cannot achieve. Here, I propose a hierarchical attractor
network that can achieve an ultra high information capacity. The network has
two layers: a visible layer with $N_v$ neurons, and a hidden layer with $N_h$
neurons. The visible-to-hidden connections are set at random and kept fixed
during the training phase, in which the memory patterns are stored as
fixed-points of the network dynamics. The hidden-to-visible connections,
initially normally distributed, are learned via a local, online learning rule
called the Three-Threshold Learning Rule and there is no within-layer
connections. The results of simulations suggested that the maximal information
capacity grows exponentially with the expansion ratio $N_h/N_v$. As a first
order approximation to understand the mechanism providing the high capacity, I
simulated a naive mean-field approximation (nMFA) of the network. The
exponential increase was captured by the nMFA, revealing that a key underlying
factor is the correlation between the hidden and the visible units.
Additionally, it was observed that, at maximal capacity, the degree of symmetry
of the connectivity between the hidden and the visible neurons increases with
the expansion ratio. These results highlight the role of hierarchical
architecture in remarkably increasing the performance of information storage in
attractor networks.

between variables, e.g. establishing whether a stimulus affects activity in a
certain brain region. The observed variables themselves often do not constitute
meaningful causal variables, however, and linear combinations need to be
considered. In electroencephalographic studies, for example, one is not
interested in establishing cause-effect relationships between electrode signals
(the observed variables), but rather between cortical signals (the causal
variables) which can be recovered as linear combinations of electrode signals.
  We introduce MERLiN (Mixture Effect Recovery in Linear Networks), a family of
causal inference algorithms that implement a novel means of constructing causal
variables from non-causal variables. We demonstrate through application to EEG
data how the basic MERLiN algorithm can be extended for application to
different (neuroimaging) data modalities. Given an observed linear mixture, the
algorithms can recover a causal variable that is a linear effect of another
given variable. That is, MERLiN allows us to recover a cortical signal that is
affected by activity in a certain brain region, while not being a direct effect
of the stimulus. The Python/Matlab implementation for all presented algorithms
is available on https://github.com/sweichwald/MERLiN

needed to dissect the important drivers of disease transmission. We introduce a
2-parameter generalized-growth model to characterize the ascending phase of an
outbreak and capture epidemic profiles ranging from sub-exponential to
exponential growth. We test the model against empirical outbreak data
representing a variety of viral pathogens and provide simulations highlighting
the importance of sub-exponential growth for forecasting purposes. We applied
the generalized-growth model to 20 infectious disease outbreaks representing a
range of transmission routes. We uncovered epidemic profiles ranging from very
slow growth (p=0.14 for the Ebola outbreak in Bomi, Liberia (2014)) to near
exponential (p>0.9 for the smallpox outbreak in Khulna (1972), and the 1918
pandemic influenza in San Francisco). The foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in
Uruguay displayed a profile of slower growth while the growth pattern of the
HIV/AIDS epidemic in Japan was approximately linear. The West African Ebola
epidemic provided a unique opportunity to explore how growth profiles vary by
geography; analysis of the largest district-level outbreaks revealed
substantial growth variations (mean p=0.59, range: 0.14-0.97). Our findings
reveal significant variation in epidemic growth patterns across different
infectious disease outbreaks and highlights that sub-exponential growth is a
common phenomenon. Sub-exponential growth profiles may result from
heterogeneity in contact structures or risk groups, reactive behavior changes,
or the early onset of interventions strategies, and consideration of
""deceleration parameters"" may be useful to refine existing mathematical
transmission models and improve disease forecasts.

  Responses"	"  Experiments that study neural encoding of stimuli at the level of individual
neurons typically choose a small set of features present in the world ---
contrast and luminance for vision, pitch and intensity for sound --- and
assemble a stimulus set that systematically varies along these dimensions.
Subsequent analysis of neural responses to these stimuli typically focuses on
regression models, with experimenter-controlled features as predictors and
spike counts or firing rates as responses. Unfortunately, this approach
requires knowledge in advance about the relevant features coded by a given
population of neurons. For domains as complex as social interaction or natural
movement, however, the relevant feature space is poorly understood, and an
arbitrary \emph{a priori} choice of features may give rise to confirmation
bias. Here, we present a Bayesian model for exploratory data analysis that is
capable of automatically identifying the features present in unstructured
stimuli based solely on neuronal responses. Our approach is unique within the
class of latent state space models of neural activity in that it assumes that
firing rates of neurons are sensitive to multiple discrete time-varying
features tied to the \emph{stimulus}, each of which has Markov (or semi-Markov)
dynamics. That is, we are modeling neural activity as driven by multiple
simultaneous stimulus features rather than intrinsic neural dynamics. We derive
a fast variational Bayesian inference algorithm and show that it correctly
recovers hidden features in synthetic data, as well as ground-truth stimulus
features in a prototypical neural dataset. To demonstrate the utility of the
algorithm, we also apply it to cluster neural responses and demonstrate
successful recovery of features corresponding to monkeys and faces in the image
set.

  excitable elements"	"  We study the emergence and coherence of stochastic oscillations in star
networks of excitable elements in which peripheral nodes receive independent
random inputs. A biophysical model of a distal branch of sensory neuron in
which peripheral nodes of Ranvier are coupled to a central node by myelinated
cable segments is used along with a generic model of networked stochastic
active rotators. We show that coherent oscillations can emerge due to
stochastic synchronization of peripheral nodes and that the degree of coherence
can be maximized by tuning the coupling strength and the size of the network.
Analytical results are obtained for the strong coupling regime of the active
rotator network. In particular, we show that in the strong coupling regime the
network dynamics can be described by an effective single active rotator with
rescaled parameters and noise.

society, their sheer number and complex interdependencies often limit a
system-level analysis. One exception is that of the network of norms that
sustain the online Wikipedia community. We study the fifteen-year evolution of
this network using the interconnected set of pages that establish, describe,
and interpret the community's norms. Despite Wikipedia's reputation for
\textit{ad hoc} governance, we find that its normative evolution is highly
conservative. The earliest users create norms that both dominate the network
and persist over time. These core norms govern both content and interpersonal
interactions using abstract principles such as neutrality, verifiability, and
assume good faith. As the network grows, norm neighborhoods decouple
topologically from each other, while increasing in semantic coherence. Taken
together, these results suggest that the evolution of Wikipedia's norm network
is akin to bureaucratic systems that predate the information age.

sensitivity of neuronal responses to changes in physical features such as
location, orientation, and intensity. What makes certain sensory
representations better suited for invariant decoding of objects by downstream
networks? We present a theory that characterizes the ability of a linear
readout network, the perceptron, to classify objects from variable neural

dimensionality, size, and shape of the object manifolds in its input neural
representation.

1512.01943	q-bio	q-bio.CB physics.bio-ph	Protein connectivity in chemotaxis receptor complexes	"  The chemotaxis sensory system allows bacteria such as Escherichia coli to
swim towards nutrients and away from repellents. The underlying pathway is
remarkably sensitive in detecting chemical gradients over a wide range of
ambient concentrations. Interactions among receptors, which are predominantly
clustered at the cell poles, are crucial to this sensitivity. Although it has
been suggested that the kinase CheA and the adapter protein CheW are integral
for receptor connectivity, the exact coupling mechanism remains unclear. Here,
we present a statistical-mechanics approach to model the receptor linkage
mechanism itself, building on nanodisc and electron cryotomography experiments.
Specifically, we investigate how the sensing behavior of mixed receptor
clusters is affected by variations in the expression levels of CheA and CheW at
a constant receptor density in the membrane. Our model compares favorably with
dose-response curves from in vivo F\""orster resonance energy transfer (FRET)
measurements, demonstrating that the receptor-methylation level has only minor
effects on receptor cooperativity. Importantly, our model provides an
explanation for the non-intuitive conclusion that the receptor cooperativity
decreases with increasing levels of CheA, a core signaling protein associated
with the receptors, whereas the receptor cooperativity increases with
increasing levels of CheW, a key adapter protein. Finally, we propose an
evolutionary advantage as explanation for the recently suggested CheW-only
linker structures.

We study how accurately linear signaling networks in cells can predict future
signals. We find that maximal predictive power results from a combination of
input-noise suppression, linear extrapolation, and selective readout of
correlated past signal values. Single-layer networks generate exponential
response kernels, which suffice to predict Markovian signals optimally.
Multilayer networks allow oscillatory kernels that can optimally predict
non-Markovian signals. At low noise, these kernels exploit the signal
derivative for extrapolation, while at high noise, they capitalize on signal
values in the past that are strongly correlated with the future signal. We show
how the common motifs of negative feedback and incoherent feed-forward can
implement these optimal response functions. Simulations reveal that E. coli can
reliably predict concentration changes for chemotaxis, and that the integration
time of its response kernel arises from a trade-off between rapid response and
noise suppression.

1512.02460	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Estimating the probability of coexistence in cross-feeding communities	"  The dynamics of many microbial ecosystems are driven by cross-feeding
interactions, in which metabolites excreted by some species are metabolised
further by others. The population dynamics of such ecosystems are governed by
frequency-dependent selection, which allows for stable coexistence of two or
more species. We have analysed a model of cross-feeding based on the replicator
equation, with the aim of establishing criteria for coexistence in ecosystems
containing three species, given the information of the three species' ability
to coexist in their three separate pairs, i.e. the long term dynamics in the
three two-species component systems. The triple-system is studied statistically
and the probability of coexistence in the species triplet is computed for two
models of species interactions. The interaction parameters are modelled either
as stochastically independent or organised in a hierarchy where any derived
metabolite carries less energy than previous nutrients in the metabolic chain.
We differentiate between different modes of coexistence with respect to the
pair-wise dynamics of the species, and find that the probability of coexistence
is close to $\frac12$ for triplet systems with three pair-wise coexistent pairs
and for so-called intransitive systems. Systems with two and one pair-wise
coexistent pairs are more likely to exist for random interaction parameters,
but are on the other hand much less likely to exhibit triplet coexistence.
Hence we conclude that certain species triplets are, from a statistical point
of view, rare, but if allowed to interact are likely to coexist. This knowledge
might be helpful when constructing synthetic microbial communities for
industrial purposes.

1512.02602	q-bio	q-bio.NC stat.AP	Accurately Predicting Functional Connectivity from Diffusion Imaging	"  Understanding the relationship between the dynamics of neural processes and
the anatomical substrate of the brain is a central question in neuroscience. On
the one hand, modern neuroimaging technologies, such as diffusion tensor
imaging, can be used to construct structural graphs representing the
architecture of white matter streamlines linking cortical and subcortical
structures. On the other hand, temporal patterns of neural activity can be used
to construct functional graphs representing temporal correlations between brain
regions. Although some studies provide evidence that whole-brain functional
connectivity is shaped by the underlying anatomy, the observed relationship
between function and structure is weak, and the rules by which anatomy
constrains brain dynamics remain elusive. In this article, we introduce a
methodology to predict with high accuracy the functional connectivity of a
subject at rest from his or her structural graph. Using our methodology, we are
able to systematically unveil the role of structural paths in the formation of
functional correlations. Furthermore, in our empirical evaluations, we observe
that the eigen-modes of the predicted functional connectivity are aligned with
activity patterns associated with different cognitive systems. Our work offers
the potential to infer properties of brain dynamics in clinical or
developmental populations with low tolerance for functional neuroimaging.

are the closest living relatives of animals. In the colony-forming species

1512.02826	q-bio	q-bio.MN	"Habitat variability does not generally promote metabolic network
  modularity in flies and mammals"	"  The evolution of species habitat range is an important topic over a wide
range of research fields. In higher organisms, habitat range evolution is
generally associated with genetic events such as gene duplication. However, the
specific factors that determine habitat variability remain unclear at higher
levels of biological organization (e.g., biochemical networks). One widely
accepted hypothesis developed from both theoretical and empirical analyses is
that habitat variability promotes network modularity; however, this
relationship has not yet been directly tested in higher organisms. Therefore, I
investigated the relationship between habitat variability and metabolic network
modularity using compound and enzymatic networks in flies and mammals. Contrary
to expectation, there was no clear positive correlation between habitat
variability and network modularity. As an exception, the network modularity
increased with habitat variability in the enzymatic networks of flies. However,
the observed association was likely an artifact, and the frequency of gene
duplication appears to be the main factor contributing to network modularity.
These findings raise the question of whether or not there is a general
mechanism for habitat range expansion at a higher level (i.e., above the gene
scale). This study suggests that the currently widely accepted hypothesis for
habitat variability should be reconsidered.

of pairs of flagella on their surface somatic cells. The somatic cells
themselves are mounted rigidly in a polymeric extracellular matrix, fixing the
orientation of the flagella so that they beat approximately in a meridional
plane, with axis of symmetry in the swimming direction, but with a roughly 15
degree azimuthal offset which results in the eponymous rotation of the colonies
about a body-fixed axis. Experiments on colonies held stationary on a
micropipette show that the beating pattern takes the form of a symplectic
metachronal wave (Brumley et al. (2012)). Here we extend the Lighthill/Blake
axisymmetric, Stokes-flow model of a free-swimming spherical squirmer
(Lighthill (1952), Blake (1971b)) to include azimuthal swirl. The measured
kinematics of the metachronal wave for 60 different colonies are used to
calculate the coefficients in the eigenfunction expansions and hence predict
the mean swimming speeds and rotation rates, proportional to the square of the
beating amplitude, as functions of colony radius. As a test of the squirmer
model, the results are compared with measurements (Drescher et al. (2009)) of
the mean swimming speeds and angular velocities of a different set of 220
colonies, also given as functions of colony radius. The predicted variation
with radius is qualitatively correct, but the model underestimates both the
mean swimming speed and the mean angular velocity unless the amplitude of the
flagellar beat is taken to be larger than previously thought. The reasons for
this discrepancy are discussed.

1512.02937	q-bio	q-bio.MN	Motif Analysis for Small-Number Effects in Chemical Reaction Dynamics	"  The number of molecules involved in a cell or subcellular structure is
sometimes rather small. In this situation, ordinary macroscopic-level
fluctuations can be overwhelmed by non-negligible large fluctuations, which
results in drastic changes in chemical-reaction dynamics and statistics
compared to those observed under a macroscopic system (i.e., with a large
number of molecules). In order to understand how salient changes emerge from
fluctuations in molecular number, we here quantitatively define small-number
effect by focusing on a `mesoscopic' level, in which the concentration
distribution is distinguishable both from micro- and macroscopic ones, and
propose a criterion for determining whether or not such an effect can emerge in
a given chemical reaction network. Using the proposed criterion, we
systematically derive a list of motifs of chemical reaction networks that can
show small-number effects, which includes motifs showing emergence of the power
law and the bimodal distribution observable in a mesoscopic regime with respect
to molecule number. The list of motifs provided herein is helpful in the search
for candidates of biochemical reactions with a small-number effect for possible
biological functions, as well as for designing a reaction system whose behavior
can change drastically depending on molecule number, rather than concentration.

as oncotripsy. The geometric model of the cells takes into account the
cytoplasm, nucleus and nucleolus, as well as the plasma membrane and nuclear
envelope. Material properties are varied within a pathophysiologically-relevant
range. A first modal analysis reveals the existence of a spectral gap between
the natural frequencies and, most importantly, resonant growth rates of healthy
and cancerous cells. The results of the modal analysis are verified by
simulating the fully-nonlinear transient response of healthy and cancerous
cells at resonance. The fully nonlinear analysis confirms that cancerous cells
can be selectively taken to lysis by the application of carefully tuned
ultrasound harmonic excitation while simultaneously leaving healthy cells
intact.

been and still is a major field of investigation in the natural sciences. By
which means, which forces, are embryonic cells and tissues assembled, deformed,
and eventually organized into an animal? Because embryogenesis deeply questions
our understanding of the mechanisms of life, it has motivated many scientific
theories and philosophies over the course of history. While genetics now seems
to have emerged as a natural background to study embryogenesis, it was intuited
long ago that it should also rely on mechanical forces and on the physical
properties of cells and tissues. In the early 20th century, Stephane Leduc
proposed that biology was merely a subset of fluid physics, and argued that
biology should focus on how forces act on living matter. Rejecting vitalism and
life-specific approaches, he designed naive experiments based on osmosis and
diffusion to mimic shapes and phenomena found in living systems, in order to
identify physical mechanisms that could support the development of the embryo.
While Leduc's ideas then had some impact in the field, notably on later
acclaimed D'Arcy Thompson, they fell into oblivion during the later 20th
century. In this article I give an overview of Stephane Leduc's physical
approach to life, and show that the paradigm that he introduced, although long
forsaken, becomes more and more topical today, as developmental biology
increasingly turns to physics and self-organization theories to study the
mechanisms of embryogenesis. His story, I suggest, bears witness to our
reluctance to abandon life-specific approaches in biology.

conclusion that if the rest 90% of the brain is not used, then many neural
pathways would degenerate. What is memory? How does the brain function? What
would be the limit of memory capacity? This article provides a model
established upon the physiological and neurological characteristics of the

explanation to explain some phenomena. It may not only have theoretically

classification. It is a rule of thumb that more complex tasks require larger
networks. However, the design of optimal network architectures for specific
tasks is still an unsolved fundamental problem. In this study, we consider
three-layered neural networks for memorizing binary patterns. We developed a
new complexity measure of binary patterns, and estimated the minimal network
size for memorizing them as a function of their complexity. We formulated the
minimal network size for regular, random, and complex patterns. In particular,
the minimal size for complex patterns, which are neither ordered nor
disordered, was predicted by measuring their Hamming distances from known
ordered patterns. Our predictions agreed with simulations based on the
back-propagation algorithm.

1512.03949	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Evolution of adaptation mechanisms: adaptation energy, stress, and
  oscillating death"	"  In 1938, H. Selye proposed the notion of adaptation energy and published
""Experimental evidence supporting the conception of adaptation energy"".
Adaptation of an animal to different factors appears as the spending of one
resource. Adaptation energy is a hypothetical extensive quantity spent for
adaptation. This term causes much debate when one takes it literally, as a
physical quantity, i.e. a sort of energy. The controversial points of view
impede the systematic use of the notion of adaptation energy despite
experimental evidence. Nevertheless, the response to many harmful factors often
has general non-specific form and we suggest that the mechanisms of
physiological adaptation admit a very general and nonspecific description.
  We aim to demonstrate that Selye's adaptation energy is the cornerstone of
the top-down approach to modelling of non-specific adaptation processes. We
analyse Selye's axioms of adaptation energy together with Goldstone's
modifications and propose a series of models for interpretation of these
axioms. {\em Adaptation energy is considered as an internal coordinate on the
`dominant path' in the model of adaptation}. The phenomena of `oscillating
death' and `oscillating remission' are predicted on the base of the dynamical
models of adaptation. Natural selection plays a key role in the evolution of
mechanisms of physiological adaptation. We use the fitness optimization
approach to study of the distribution of resources for neutralization of
harmful factors, during adaptation to a multifactor environment, and analyse
the optimal strategies for different systems of factors.

1512.03970	q-bio	q-bio.PE math.DS math.PR	Coexistence in the face of uncertainty	"  Over the past century, nonlinear difference and differential equations have
been used to understand conditions for species coexistence. However, these
models fail to account for random fluctuations due to demographic and
environmental stochasticity which are experienced by all populations. I review
some recent mathematical results about persistence and coexistence for models
accounting for each of these forms of stochasticity. Demographic stochasticity
stems from populations and communities consisting of a finite number of
interacting individuals, and often are represented by Markovian models with a
countable number of states. For closed populations in a bounded world,
extinction occurs in finite time but may be preceded by long-term transients.
Quasi-stationary distributions (QSDs) of these Makov models characterize this
meta-stable behavior. For sufficiently large ""habitat sizes"", QSDs are shown to
concentrate on the positive attractors of deterministic models. Moreover, the
probability extinction decreases exponentially with habitat size.
Alternatively, environmental stochasticity stems from fluctuations in
environmental conditions which influence survival, growth, and reproduction.
Stochastic difference equations can be used to model the effects of
environmental stochasticity on population and community dynamics. For these
models, stochastic persistence corresponds to empirical measures placing
arbitrarily little weight on arbitrarily low population densities. Sufficient
and necessary conditions for stochastic persistence are reviewed. These
conditions involve weighted combinations of Lyapunov exponents corresponding to
""average"" per-capita growth rates of rare species. The results are illustrated
with Bay checkerspot butterflies, coupled sink populations, the storage effect,
and stochastic rock-paper-scissor communities. Open problems and conjectures
are presented.

1512.03988	q-bio	q-bio.MN	Hybrid framework for the simulation of stochastic chemical kinetics	"  Stochasticity plays a fundamental role in various biochemical processes, such
as cell regulatory networks and enzyme cascades. Isothermal, well-mixed systems
can be modelled as Markov processes, typically simulated using the Gillespie
Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA). While easy to implement and exact, the
computational cost of using the Gillespie SSA to simulate such systems can
become prohibitive as the frequency of reaction events increases. This has
motivated numerous coarse-grained schemes, where the ""fast"" reactions are
approximated either using Langevin dynamics or deterministically. While such
approaches provide a good approximation when all reactants are abundant, the
approximation breaks down when one or more species exist only in small
concentrations and the fluctuations arising from the discrete nature of the
reactions becomes significant. This is particularly problematic when using such
methods to compute statistics of extinction times for chemical species, as well
as simulating non-equilibrium systems such as cell-cycle models in which a
single species can cycle between abundance and scarcity. In this paper, a
hybrid jump-diffusion model for simulating well- mixed stochastic kinetics is
derived. It acts as a bridge between the Gillespie SSA and the chemical
Langevin equation. For low reactant reactions the underlying behaviour is
purely discrete, while purely diffusive when the concentrations of all species
is large, with the two different behaviours coexisting in the intermediate
region. A bound on the weak error in the classical large volume scaling limit
is obtained, and three different numerical discretizations of the
jump-diffusion model are described. The benefits of such a formalism are
illustrated using computational examples.

through relatively small distances, provoking either a state of alarm when they
move away from potentially dangerous stimulus, or charge toward it
aggressively. There is almost no knowledge if danger information can be
transmitted along large distances. In this paper, we perturb leaf cutting ants
of the species Atta insularis while they forage in their natural evioronment at
a certain point of the foraging line, so ants make a ""U"" turn to escape from
the danger zone and go back to the nest. Our results strongly suggest that
those ants do not transmit ""danger information"" to other nestmates marching
towards the danger area. The individualistic behavior of the ants returning
from the danger zone results in a depression of the foraging activity due to
the systematic sacrifice of non-informed individuals.

localized pulses and evolve by processes such as diffusion and mixing. We show
that, in such environments, physical limits on the accuracy of temporal
gradient sensing govern when and where bacteria can accurately measure the cues
they use to navigate. Chemical pulses are surrounded by a predictable dynamic
region, outside which bacterial cells cannot resolve gradients above noise. The
outer boundary of this region initially expands in proportion to $\sqrt{t}$,
before rapidly contracting. Our analysis also reveals how chemokinesis - the
increase in swimming speed many bacteria exhibit when absolute chemical
concentration exceeds a threshold - may serve to enhance chemotactic accuracy
and sensitivity when the chemical landscape is dynamic. More generally, our
framework provides a rigorous method for partitioning bacteria into populations
that are ""near"" and ""far"" from chemical hotspots in complex, rapidly evolving
environments such as those that dominate aquatic ecosystems.

  network formation in fMRI data of the human brain"	"  The formation of transient networks in response to external stimuli or as a
reflection of internal cognitive processes is a hallmark of human brain
function. However, its identification in fMRI data of the human brain is
notoriously difficult. Here we propose a new method of fMRI data analysis that
tackles this problem by considering large-scale, task-related synchronisation
networks. Networks consist of nodes and edges connecting them, where nodes
correspond to voxels in fMRI data, and the weight of an edge is determined via
task-related changes in dynamic synchronisation between their respective times
series. Based on these definitions, we developed a new data analysis algorithm
that identifies edges in a brain network that differentially respond in unison
to a task onset and that occur in dense packs with similar characteristics.
Hence, we call this approach ""Task-related Edge Density"" (TED). TED proved to
be a very strong marker for dynamic network formation that easily lends itself
to statistical analysis using large scale statistical inference. A major
advantage of TED compared to other methods is that it does not depend on any
specific hemodynamic response model, and it also does not require a
presegmentation of the data for dimensionality reduction as it can handle large
networks consisting of tens of thousands of voxels. We applied TED to fMRI data
of a fingertapping task provided by the Human Connectome Project. TED revealed
network-based involvement of a large number of brain areas that evaded
detection using traditional GLM-based analysis. We show that our proposed
method provides an entirely new window into the immense complexity of human
brain function.

  potential"	"  The main contribution to the local field potential (LFP) is thought to stem
from synaptic input to neurons and the ensuing subthreshold dendritic
processing. The role of active dendritic conductances in shaping the LFP has
received little attention, even though such ion channels are known to affect
the subthreshold neuron dynamics. Here we used a modeling approach to
investigate the effects of subthreshold dendritic conductances on the LFP.
Using a biophysically detailed, experimentally constrained model of a cortical
pyramidal neuron, we identified conditions under which subthreshold active
conductances are a major factor in shaping the LFP. We found that particularly
the hyperpolarization-activated inward current, I$_{\rm h}$, can have a sizable
effect and cause a resonance in the LFP power spectral density. To get a
general, qualitative understanding of how any subthreshold active dendritic
conductance and its cellular distribution can affect the LFP, we next performed
a systematic study with a simplified model. We found that the effect on the LFP
is most pronounced when (1) the synaptic drive to the cell is asymmetrically
distributed (i.e., either basal or apical), (2) the active conductances are
distributed non-uniformly with the highest channel densities near the synaptic
input, and (3) when the LFP is measured at the opposite pole of the cell
relative to the synaptic input. In summary, we show that subthreshold active
conductances can be strongly reflected in LFP signals, opening up the
possibility that the LFP can be used to characterize the properties and
cellular distributions of active conductances.

manual measurements of tissue cellular content and sub-cellular compartments.
Since the current manual methodology for image analysis is a tedious and

cells of interest in composite fluorescent tissue images, in which cell borders
are not visible. Nuquantus is an adaptive framework that learns the
morphological attributes of intact tissue in the presence of anatomical
variability and pathological processes. Nuquantus allowed us to robustly
perform quantitative image analysis on remodeling cardiac tissue after
myocardial infarction. Nuquantus reliably classifies cardiomyocyte versus

shown to describe many observed aspects of coordination tasks. We present here
a bifurcation study of this model, where we consider a delay in the coupling.
The delay is shown to have a significant effect on the observed dynamics. In
particular, we find a much larger degree of bistablility between in-phase and
anti-phase oscillations in the presence of a frequency detuning.

  oscillators"	"  We study the effect of additive Brownian noise on an ODE system that has a
stable hyperbolic limit cycle, for initial data that are attracted to the limit
cycle. The analysis is performed in the limit of small noise - that is, we
modulate the noise by a factor $\varepsilon \searrow 0$ - and on a long time
horizon. We prove explicit estimates on the proximity of the noisy trajectory
and the limit cycle up to times $\exp\left(c \varepsilon^{-2}\right)$, $c>0$,
and we show both that on the time scale $\varepsilon^{-2}$ the ""'dephasing""
(i.e., the difference between noiseless and noisy system measured in a natural
coordinate system that involves a phase) is close to a Brownian motion with
constant drift, and that on longer time scales the dephasing dynamics is
dominated, to leading order, by the drift. The natural choice of coordinates,
that reduces the dynamics in a neighborhood of the cycle to a rotation, plays a
central role and makes the connection with the applied science literature in
which noisy limit cycle dynamics are often reduced to a diffusion model for the
phase of the limit cycle.

1512.04590	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"An evolutionary model of tumor cell kinetics and the emergence of
  molecular heterogeneity driving Gompertzian growth"	"  A cell-molecular based evolutionary model of tumor development driven by a
stochastic Moran birth-death process is developed, where each cell carries
molecular information represented by a four-digit binary string, used to
differentiate cells into 16 molecular types. The binary string value determines
cell fitness, with lower fit cells (e.g. 0000) defined as healthy phenotypes,
and higher fit cells (e.g. 1111) defined as malignant phenotypes. At each step
of the birth-death process, the two phenotypic sub-populations compete in a
prisoner's dilemma evolutionary game with healthy cells (cooperators) competing
with cancer cells (defectors). Fitness and birth-death rates are defined via
the prisoner's dilemma payoff matrix. Cells are able undergo two types of
stochastic point mutations passed to the daughter cell's binary string during
birth: passenger mutations (conferring no fitness advantage) and driver
mutations (increasing cell fitness). Dynamic phylogenetic trees show clonal
expansions of cancer cell sub-populations from an initial malignant cell. The
tumor growth equation states that the growth rate is proportional to the
logarithm of cellular heterogeneity, here measured using the Shannon entropy of
the distribution of binary sequences in the tumor cell population. Nonconstant
tumor growth rates, (exponential growth during sub-clinical range of the tumor
and subsequent slowed growth during tumor saturation) are associated with a
Gompertzian growth curve, an emergent feature of the model explained here using
simple statistical mechanics principles related to the degree of functional
coupling of the cell states. Dosing strategies at early stage development,
mid-stage (clinical stage), and late stage development of the tumor are
compared, showing therapy is most effective during the sub-clinical stage,
before the cancer subpopulation is selected for growth.

1512.04591	q-bio	q-bio.PE	The Prisoner's dilemma as a cancer model	"  Tumor development is an evolutionary process in which a heterogeneous
population of cells with differential growth capabilities compete for resources
in order to gain a proliferative advantage. What are the minimal ingredients
needed to recreate some of the emergent features of such a developing complex
ecosystem? What is a tumor doing before we can detect it? We outline a
mathematical model, driven by a stochastic Moran process, in which cancer cells
and healthy cells compete for dominance in the population. Each are assigned
payoffs according to a Prisoner's Dilemma evolutionary game where the healthy
cells are the cooperators and the cancer cells are the defectors. With point
mutational dynamics, heredity, and a fitness landscape controlling birth and
death rates, natural selection acts on the cell population and simulated
""cancer-like"" features emerge, such as Gompertzian tumor growth driven by
heterogeneity, the log-kill law which (linearly) relates therapeutic dose
density to the (log) probability of cancer cell survival, and the Norton-Simon
hypothesis which (linearly) relates tumor regression rates to tumor growth
rates. We highlight the utility, clarity, and power that such models provide,
despite (and because of) their simplicity and built-in assumptions.

1512.04982	q-bio	q-bio.QM cond-mat.dis-nn	"Score distributions of gapped multiple sequence alignments down to the
  low-probability tail"	"  Assessing the significance of alignment scores of optimally aligned DNA or
amino acid sequences can be achieved via the knowledge of the score
distribution of random sequences. But this requires obtaining the distribution
in the biologically relevant high-scoring region, where the probabilities are
exponentially small. For gapless local alignments of infinitely long sequences
this distribution is known analytically to follow a Gumbel distribution.
Distributions for gapped local alignments and global alignments of finite
lengths can only be obtained numerically. To obtain result for the
small-probability region, specific statistical mechanics-based rare-event
algorithms can be applied. In previous studies, this was achieved for pairwise
alignments. They showed that, contrary to results from previous simple sampling
studies, strong deviations from the Gumbel distribution occur in case of finite
sequence lengths. Here we extend the studies to the for practical applications
in Molecular Biology much more relevant case of multiple sequence alignments
with gaps. We study the distributions of scores over a large range of the
support, reaching probabilities as small as 10^-160, for global and local
(sum-of-pair scores) multiple alignments. We find that even after suitable
rescaling, eliminating the sequence-length dependence, the distributions for
multiple alignment differ from the pairwise alignment case. Furthermore, we
also show that the previously discussed Gaussian correction to the Gumbel
distribution needs to be refined, also for the case of pairwise alignments.

Surprisingly, the phase diagram as well as the transition lines between the

1512.05213	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"The Tangled Nature Model of evolutionary dynamics reconsidered:
  structural and dynamical effects of trait inheritance"	"  The Tangled Nature Model of biological and cultural evolution features
interacting agents which compete for limited resources and reproduce in an
error prone fashion and at a rate depending on the `tangle' of interactions
they maintain with others.
  The set of interactions linking a TNM individual to others is key to its
reproductive success and arguably constitutes its most important property. Yet,
in many studies, the interactions of an individual and those of its mutated
off-spring are unrelated, a rather unrealistic feature corresponding to a point
mutation turning a giraffe into an elephant. To bring out the structural and
dynamical effects of trait inheritance , we introduce and numerically analyze a
family of TNM models where a positive integer $K$ parametrises correlations
between the interactions of an agent and those of its mutated offspring. For
$K=1$ a single point mutation randomizes all the interactions, while increasing
$K$ up to the length of the genome ensures an increasing level of trait
inheritance. We show that the distribution of the interactions generated by our
rule is nearly independent of the value of $K$. Changing $K$ strengthens the
core structure of the ecology, leads to population abundance distributions
which are better approximated by log-normal probability densities and increases
the probability that a species extant at time $t_{\rm w}$ is also extant at a
later time $t$. In particular, survival probabilities are shown to decay as
powers of the ratio $t/t_{\rm w}$, similarity to the pure aging behaviour
approximately describing glassy systems of physical origin. Increasing the
value of $K$ decreases the numerical value of the decay exponent of the power
law, which is a clear quantitative dynamical effect of trait inheritance.

  Imitation Brain-Computer Interface"	"  To study body ownership and control, illusions that elicit these feelings in
non-body objects are widely used. Classically introduced with the Rubber Hand
Illusion, these illusions have been replicated more recently in virtual reality
and by using brain-computer interfaces. Traditionally these illusions
investigate the replacement of a body part by an artificial counterpart,
however as brain-computer interface research develops it offers us the
possibility to explore the case where non-body objects are controlled in
addition to movements of our own limbs. Therefore we propose a new illusion
designed to test the feeling of ownership and control of an independent
supernumerary hand. Subjects are under the impression they control a virtual
reality hand via a brain-computer interface, but in reality there is no causal
connection between brain activity and virtual hand movement but correct
movements are observed with 80% probability. These imitation brain-computer
interface trials are interspersed with movements in both the subjects' real
hands, which are in view throughout the experiment. We show that subjects
develop strong feelings of ownership and control over the third hand, despite
only receiving visual feedback with no causal link to the actual brain signals.
Our illusion is crucially different from previously reported studies as we
demonstrate independent ownership and control of the third hand without loss of
ownership in the real hands.

inputs for species tree and supertree reconstruction. Computational constraints
prevent the use of all displayed quartets in many practical problems due to the
number of taxa. We introduce the notion of an Efficient Quartet System (EQS) to
represent a phylogenetic tree with a subset of the quartets displayed by the
tree. We show mathematically that the set of quartets obtained from a tree via
an EQS contains all of the combinatorial information of the tree itself. Using
performance tests on simulated datasets, we also demonstrate that using an EQS
to reduce the number of quartets in pipelines for summary methods of species
tree inference and supertree inference results in only small reductions in
accuracy.

1512.05420	q-bio	q-bio.QM q-bio.MN	"Inter-protein sequence co-evolution predicts known physical interactions
  in bacterial ribosomes and the trp operon"	"  Interaction between proteins is a fundamental mechanism that underlies
virtually all biological processes. Many important interactions are conserved
across a large variety of species. The need to maintain interaction leads to a
high degree of co-evolution between residues in the interface between partner
proteins. The inference of protein-protein interaction networks from the
rapidly growing sequence databases is one of the most formidable tasks in
systems biology today. We propose here a novel approach based on the
Direct-Coupling Analysis of the co-evolution between inter-protein residue
pairs. We use ribosomal and trp operon proteins as test cases: For the small
resp. large ribosomal subunit our approach predicts protein-interaction
partners at a true-positive rate of 70% resp. 90% within the first 10
predictions, with areas of 0.69 resp. 0.81 under the ROC curves for all
predictions. In the trp operon, it assigns the two largest interaction scores
to the only two interactions experimentally known. On the level of residue
interactions we show that for both the small and the large ribosomal subunit
our approach predicts interacting residues in the system with a true positive
rate of 60% and 85% in the first 20 predictions. We use artificial data to show
that the performance of our approach depends crucially on the size of the joint
multiple sequence alignments and analyze how many sequences would be necessary
for a perfect prediction if the sequences were sampled from the same model that
we use for prediction. Given the performance of our approach on the test data
we speculate that it can be used to detect new interactions, especially in the
light of the rapid growth of available sequence data.

1512.05431	q-bio	physics.bio-ph math.PR q-bio.PE	A Path Integral Approach to Age Dependent Branching Processes	"  Age dependent population dynamics are frequently modeled with generalizations
of the classic McKendrick-von Foerster equation. These are deterministic
systems, and a stochastic generalization was recently reported in [1,2]. Here
we develop a fully stochastic theory for age-structured populations via quantum
field theoretical Doi-Peliti techniques. This results in a path integral
formulation where birth and death events correspond to cubic and quadratic
interaction terms. This formalism allows us to efficiently recapitulate the
results in [1,2], exemplifying the utility of Doi-Peliti methods. Furthermore,
we find that the path integral formulation for age-structured moments has an
exact perturbative expansion that explicitly relates to the hereditary
structure between correlated individuals. These methods are then generalized
with a binary fission model of cell division.

age-structured populations. After reviewing existing approaches, we present a
full kinetic framework for age-structured interacting populations undergoing
birth, death and fission processes, in spatially dependent environments. We
define the complete probability density for the population-size-age-chart and
find results under specific conditions. Connections with more classical models
are also explicitly derived. In particular, we show that factorial moments for
non-interacting processes are described by a natural generalization of the
McKendrick-von Foerster equation, which describes mean-field deterministic
behaviour. Our approach utilizes mixed type, multi-dimensional probability
distributions similar to those employed in the study of gas kinetics, with
terms that satisfy BBGKY-like equation hierarchies.

1512.05463	q-bio	cs.NE q-bio.NC	"Continuous online sequence learning with an unsupervised neural network
  model"	"  The ability to recognize and predict temporal sequences of sensory inputs is
vital for survival in natural environments. Based on many known properties of
cortical neurons, hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) sequence memory is
recently proposed as a theoretical framework for sequence learning in the
cortex. In this paper, we analyze properties of HTM sequence memory and apply
it to sequence learning and prediction problems with streaming data. We show
the model is able to continuously learn a large number of variable-order
temporal sequences using an unsupervised Hebbian-like learning rule. The sparse
temporal codes formed by the model can robustly handle branching temporal
sequences by maintaining multiple predictions until there is sufficient
disambiguating evidence. We compare the HTM sequence memory with other sequence
learning algorithms, including statistical methods: autoregressive integrated
moving average (ARIMA), feedforward neural networks: online sequential extreme
learning machine (ELM), and recurrent neural networks: long short-term memory
(LSTM) and echo-state networks (ESN), on sequence prediction problems with both
artificial and real-world data. The HTM model achieves comparable accuracy to
other state-of-the-art algorithms. The model also exhibits properties that are
critical for sequence learning, including continuous online learning, the
ability to handle multiple predictions and branching sequences with high order
statistics, robustness to sensor noise and fault tolerance, and good
performance without task-specific hyper- parameters tuning. Therefore the HTM
sequence memory not only advances our understanding of how the brain may solve
the sequence learning problem, but is also applicable to a wide range of
real-world problems such as discrete and continuous sequence prediction,
anomaly detection, and sequence classification.

1512.05478	q-bio	cond-mat.dis-nn math-ph math.MP q-bio.NC	Non-Hermitian Localization in Biological Networks	"  We explore the spectra and localization properties of the N-site banded
one-dimensional non-Hermitian random matrices that arise naturally in sparse
neural networks. Approximately equal numbers of random excitatory and
inhibitory connections lead to spatially localized eigenfunctions, and an
intricate eigenvalue spectrum in the complex plane that controls the
spontaneous activity and induced response. A finite fraction of the eigenvalues
condense onto the real or imaginary axes. For large N, the spectrum has
remarkable symmetries not only with respect to reflections across the real and
imaginary axes, but also with respect to 90 degree rotations, with an unusual
anisotropic divergence in the localization length near the origin. When chains
with periodic boundary conditions become directed, with a systematic
directional bias superimposed on the randomness, a hole centered on the origin
opens up in the density-of-states in the complex plane. All states are extended
on the rim of this hole, while the localized eigenvalues outside the hole are
unchanged. The bias dependent shape of this hole tracks the bias independent
contours of constant localization length. We treat the large-N limit by a
combination of direct numerical diagonalization and using transfer matrices, an
approach that allows us to exploit an electrostatic analogy connecting the
""charges"" embodied in the eigenvalue distribution with the contours of constant
localization length. We show that similar results are obtained for more
realistic neural networks that obey ""Dale's Law"" (each site is purely
excitatory or inhibitory), and conclude with perturbation theory results that
describe the limit of large bias g, when all states are extended. Related
problems arise in random ecological networks and in chains of artificial cells
with randomly coupled gene expression patterns.

or VR displays will make it possible to trace not only what objects we look at
but also the level of attention in a given situation. Exploring whether we can
quantify the engagement of a user interacting with a laptop, we apply mobile
eye tracking in an in-depth study over 2 weeks with nearly 10.000 observations
to assess pupil size changes, related to attentional aspects of alertness,
orientation and conflict resolution. Visually presenting conflicting cues and
targets we hypothesize that it's feasible to measure the allocated effort when
responding to confusing stimuli. Although such experiments are normally carried
out in a lab, we are able to differentiate between sustained alertness and
complex decision making even with low cost eye tracking ""in the wild"". From a
quantified self perspective of individual behavioral adaptation, the
correlations between the pupil size and the task dependent reaction time and
error rates may longer term provide a foundation for modifying smartphone
content and interaction to the users perceived level of attention.

traits, including disease states, are usually found in non-coding genomic
regions. These genetic variants are often also associated to differences in
expression levels of nearby genes (they are ""expression quantitative trait
loci"" or eQTLs for short) and presumably play a gene regulatory role, affecting
the status of molecular networks of interacting genes, proteins and
metabolites. Computational systems biology approaches to reconstruct causal
gene networks from large-scale omics data have therefore become essential to
understand the structure of networks controlled by eQTLs together with other
regulatory genes, and to generate detailed hypotheses about the molecular
mechanisms that lead from genotype to phenotype. Here we review the main
analytical methods and softwares to identify eQTLs and their associated genes,
to reconstruct co-expression networks and modules, to reconstruct causal
Bayesian gene and module networks, and to validate predicted networks in

1512.05602	q-bio	q-bio.CB q-bio.TO	"Towards a cell-based mechanostat theory of bone: the need to account for
  osteocyte desensitisation and osteocyte replacement"	"  Bone's mechanostat theory describes the adaptation of bone tissues to their
mechanical environment. Many experiments have investigated and observed such
structural adaptation. However, there is still much uncertainty about how to
define the reference mechanical state at which bone structure is adapted and
stable. Clinical and experimental observations show that this reference state
varies both in space and in time, over a wide range of timescales. We propose
an osteocyte-based mechanostat theory that links various timescales of
structural adaptation with various dynamic features of the osteocyte network in
bone. This theory assumes that osteocytes are formed adapted to their current
local mechanical environment through modulation of morphological and genotypic
osteocyte properties involved in mechanical sensitivity. We distinguish two
main types of physiological responses by which osteocytes subsequently modify
the reference mechanical state. One is the replacement of osteocytes during
bone remodelling, which occurs over the long timescales of bone turnover. The
other is cell desensitisation responses, which occur more rapidly and
reversibly during an osteocyte's lifetime. The novelty of this theory is to
propose that long-lasting morphological and genotypic osteocyte properties
provide a material basis for a long-term mechanical memory of bone that is
gradually reset by bone remodelling. We test this theory by simulating
long-term mechanical disuse (modelling spinal cord injury), and short-term
mechanical loadings (modelling daily exercises) with a mathematical model. The
consideration of osteocyte desensitisation and of osteocyte replacement by
remodelling is able to capture the different phenomena and timescales observed
during the mechanical adaptation of bone tissues, lending support to this
theory.

algorithm modelling the spread of genetic mutations in populations. The
algorithm runs on an underlying graph where individuals correspond to vertices.
Initially, one vertex (chosen u.a.r.) possesses a mutation, with fitness r>1.
All other individuals have fitness 1. During each step of the algorithm, an
individual is chosen with probability proportional to its fitness, and its
state (mutant or non-mutant) is passed on to an out-neighbour which is chosen
u.a.r. If the underlying graph is strongly connected then the algorithm will
eventually reach fixation, in which all individuals are mutants, or extinction,
in which no individuals are mutants. An infinite family of directed graphs is
said to be strongly amplifying if, for every r>1, the extinction probability
tends to 0 as the number of vertices increases. Lieberman et al. proposed two
potentially strongly-amplifying families - superstars and metafunnels.
Heuristic arguments have been published, arguing that there are infinite
families of superstars that are strongly amplifying. The same has been claimed
for metafunnels. In this paper, we give the first rigorous proof that there is
an infinite family of directed graphs that is strongly amplifying. We call the
graphs in the family ""megastars"". When the algorithm is run on an n-vertex
graph in this family, starting with a uniformly-chosen mutant, the extinction
probability is roughly $n^{-1/2}$ (up to logarithmic factors). We prove that
all infinite families of superstars and metafunnels have larger extinction
probabilities (as a function of n). Finally, we prove that our analysis of
megastars is fairly tight - there is no infinite family of megastars such that
the Moran algorithm gives a smaller extinction probability (up to logarithmic
factors).

  simulation"	"  We develop, analyse and numerically simulate a model of a prototype,
glucose-driven, rhythmic drug delivery device, aimed at hormone therapies, and
based on chemomechanical interaction in a polyelectrolyte gel membrane. The
pH-driven interactions trigger volume phase transitions between the swollen and
collapsed states of the gel.For a robust set of material parameters, we find a
class of solutions of the governing system that oscillate between such states,
and cause the membrane to rhythmically swell, allowing for transport of the
drug, fuel and reaction products across it, and collapse, hampering all
transport across it. The frequency of the oscillations can be adjusted so that
it matches the natural frequency of the hormone to be released. The work is
linked to extensive laboratory experimental studies of the device built by
Siegel's team. The thinness of the membrane and its clamped boundary, together
with the homogeneously held conditions in the experimental apparatus, justify
neglecting spatial dependence on the fields of the problem. Upon identifying
the forces and energy relevant to the system, and taking into account its
dissipative properties, we apply Rayleigh's variational principle to obtain the
governing equations. The material assumptions guarantee the monotonicity of the
system and lead to the existence of a three dimensional limit cycle. By scaling
and asymptotic analysis, this limit cycle is found to be related to a
two-dimensional one that encodes the volume phase transitions of the model. The
identification of the relevant parameter set of the model is aided by a Hopf
bifurcation study of steady state solutions.

differentiated cells are constantly produced and migrate out of these niches.
In this article, we provide a general theoretical framework to study mixtures
of dividing and actively migrating particles, which we apply to biological
tissues. We show in particular that the interplay between the stresses arising

either steady or oscillating in time. The wavelength of the instability has an
order of magnitude consistent with the biological observations. We also discuss
the implications of these results for future in vitro and in vivo experiments.

information, detection of alternative isoform regulation (AIR) remains
difficult, particularly when working with an incomplete transcript annotation.
We introduce JunctionSeq, a new method that builds on the statistical
techniques used by the well-established DEXSeq package to detect differential
usage of both exonic regions and splice junctions. In particular, JunctionSeq
is capable of detecting differentials in novel splice junctions without the
need for an additional isoform assembly step, greatly improving performance
when the available transcript annotation is flawed or incomplete. JunctionSeq
also provides a powerful and streamlined visualization toolset that allows
bioinformaticians to quickly and intuitively interpret their results. We tested
our method on publicly available data from several experiments performed on the
rat pineal gland and Toxoplasma gondii, successfully detecting known and
previously validated AIR genes in 19 out of 19 gene-level hypothesis tests. Due
to its ability to query novel splice sites, JunctionSeq is still able to detect
these differentials even when all alternative isoforms for these genes were not
included in the transcript annotation. JunctionSeq thus provides a powerful
method for detecting alternative isoform regulation even with low-quality
annotations. An implementation of JunctionSeq is available as an R/Bioconductor
package.

molecules to neutralize pathogens. Yet, viruses such as HIV can cause chronic
infections by evolving as quickly as the adaptive immune system, forming an
evolutionary arms race. Here we introduce a mathematical framework to study the
coevolutionary dynamics of antibodies with antigens within a host. We focus on
changes in the binding interactions between the antibody and antigen
populations, which result from the underlying stochastic evolution of genotype
frequencies driven by mutation, selection, and drift. We identify the critical
viral and immune parameters that determine the distribution of antibody-antigen
binding affinities. We also identify definitive signatures of coevolution that
measure the reciprocal response between antibodies and viruses, and we
introduce experimentally measurable quantities that quantify the extent of
adaptation during continual coevolution of the two opposing populations. Using
this analytical framework, we infer rates of viral and immune adaptation based
on time-shifted neutralization assays in two HIV-infected patients. Finally, we
analyze competition between clonal lineages of antibodies and characterize the
fate of a given lineage in terms of the state of the antibody and viral
populations. In particular, we derive the conditions that favor the emergence
of broadly neutralizing antibodies, which may be useful in designing a vaccine
against HIV.

information storage and the communication topology of information flows within
a system. Over the last decade and a half, diagnostics for the latter have come
to be dominated by the transfer entropy. Via straightforward examples, we show
that it and a derivative quantity, the causation entropy, do not, in fact,
quantify the flow of information. At one and the same time they can
overestimate flow or underestimate influence. We isolate why this is the case
and propose several avenues to alternate measures for information flow. We also
address an auxiliary consequence: The proliferation of networks as a now-common
theoretical model for large-scale systems, in concert with the use of
transfer-like entropies, has shoehorned dyadic relationships into our
structural interpretation of the organization and behavior of complex systems.
This interpretation thus fails to include the effects of polyadic dependencies.
The net result is that much of the sophisticated organization of complex
systems may go undetected.

(G-CSF) incorporating both the freely circulating concentration and the
concentration of the cytokine bound to mature neutrophils. G-CSF concentrations
are used to directly regulate neutrophil production, with the rate of
differentiation of stem cells to neutrophil precursors, the effective
proliferation rate in mitosis, the maturation time, and the release rate from
the mature marrow reservoir into circulation all dependent on the level of
G-CSF in the system. The dependence of the maturation time on the cytokine
concentration introduces a state-dependent delay into our differential equation
model, and we show how this is derived from an age-structured partial
differential equation model of the mitosis and maturation, and also detail the
derivation of the rest of our model. The model and its estimated parameters are
shown to successfully predict the neutrophil and G-CSF responses to a variety
of treatment scenarios, including the combined administration of chemotherapy
and exogenous G-CSF. This concomitant treatment was reproduced without any
additional fitting to characterise drug-drug interactions.

1512.07043	q-bio	math.DS cs.SY math.OC q-bio.MN	Sign properties of Metzler matrices with applications	"  Several results about sign properties of Metzler matrices are obtained. It is
first established that checking the sign-stability of a Metzler sign-matrix can
be either characterized in terms of the Hurwitz stability of the unit
sign-matrix in the corresponding qualitative class, or in terms the negativity
of the diagonal elements of the Metzler sign-matrix and the acyclicity of the
associated directed graph. Similar results are obtained for the case of Metzler
block-matrices and Metzler mixed-matrices, the latter being a class of Metzler
matrices containing both sign- and real-type entries. The problem of assessing
the sign-stability of the convex hull of a finite and summable family of
Metzler matrices is also solved, and a necessary and sufficient condition for
the existence of common Lyapunov functions for all the matrices in the convex
hull is obtained. The concept of sign-stability is then generalized to the
concept of Ker$_+(B)$-sign-stability, a problem that arises in the analysis of
certain jump Markov processes. A sufficient condition for the
Ker$_+(B)$-sign-stability of Metzler sign-matrices is obtained and formulated
using inverses of sign-matrices and the concept of $L^+$-matrices. Several
applications of the results are discussed in the last section.

1512.07450	q-bio	cs.NE cs.CC nlin.CG q-bio.PE	Interacting Behavior and Emerging Complexity	"  Can we quantify the change of complexity throughout evolutionary processes?
We attempt to address this question through an empirical approach. In very
general terms, we simulate two simple organisms on a computer that compete over
limited available resources. We implement Global Rules that determine the
interaction between two Elementary Cellular Automata on the same grid. Global
Rules change the complexity of the state evolution output which suggests that
some complexity is intrinsic to the interaction rules themselves. The largest
increases in complexity occurred when the interacting elementary rules had very
little complexity, suggesting that they are able to accept complexity through
interaction only. We also found that some Class 3 or 4 CA rules are more
fragile than others to Global Rules, while others are more robust, hence
suggesting some intrinsic properties of the rules independent of the Global
Rule choice. We provide statistical mappings of Elementary Cellular Automata
exposed to Global Rules and different initial conditions onto different
complexity classes.

1512.07459	q-bio	q-bio.PE cs.DS	Reduction rules for the maximum parsimony distance on phylogenetic trees	"  In phylogenetics, distances are often used to measure the incongruence
between a pair of phylogenetic trees that are reconstructed by different
methods or using different regions of genome. Motivated by the maximum
parsimony principle in tree inference, we recently introduced the maximum
parsimony (MP) distance, which enjoys various attractive properties due to its
connection with several other well-known tree distances, such as TBR and SPR.
Here we show that computing the MP distance between two trees, a NP-hard
problem in general, is fixed parameter tractable in terms of the TBR distance
between the tree pair. Our approach is based on two reduction rules--the chain
reduction and the subtree reduction--that are widely used in computing TBR and
SPR distances. More precisely, we show that reducing chains to length 4 (but
not shorter) preserves the MP distance. In addition, we describe a
generalization of the subtree reduction which allows the pendant subtrees to be
rooted in different places, and show that this still preserves the MP distance.
On a slightly different note we also show that Monadic Second Order Logic
(MSOL), posited over an auxiliary graph structure known as the display graph
(obtained by merging the two trees at their leaves), can be used to obtain an
alternative proof that computation of MP distance is fixed parameter tractable
in terms of TBR-distance. We conclude with an extended discussion in which we
focus on similarities and differences between MP distance and TBR distance and
present a number of open problems. One particularly intriguing question,
emerging from the MSOL formulation, is whether two trees with bounded MP
distance induce display graphs of bounded treewidth.

1512.07596	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Choosing Wavelet Methods, Filters, and Lengths for Functional Brain
  Network Construction"	"  Wavelet methods are widely used to decompose fMRI, EEG, or MEG signals into
time series representing neurophysiological activity in fixed frequency bands.
Using these time series, one can estimate frequency-band specific functional
connectivity between sensors or regions of interest, and thereby construct
functional brain networks that can be examined from a graph theoretic
perspective. Despite their common use, however, practical guidelines for the
choice of wavelet method, filter, and length have remained largely
undelineated. Here, we explicitly explore the effects of wavelet method (MODWT
vs. DWT), wavelet filter (Daubechies Extremal Phase, Daubechies Least
Asymmetric, and Coiflet families), and wavelet length (2 to 24) - each
essential parameters in wavelet-based methods - on the estimated values of
network diagnostics and in their sensitivity to alterations in psychiatric
disease. We observe that the MODWT method produces less variable estimates than
the DWT method. We also observe that the length of the wavelet filter chosen
has a greater impact on the estimated values of network diagnostics than the
type of wavelet chosen. Furthermore, wavelet length impacts the sensitivity of
the method to detect differences between health and disease and tunes
classification accuracy. Collectively, our results suggest that the choice of
wavelet method and length significantly alters the reliability and sensitivity
of these methods in estimating values of network diagnostics drawn from graph
theory. They furthermore demonstrate the importance of reporting the choices
utilized in neuroimaging studies and support the utility of exploring wavelet
parameters to maximize classification accuracy in the development of biomarkers
of psychiatric disease and neurological disorders.

1512.07603	q-bio	q-bio.PE cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech nlin.CD	Symmetric and Asymmetric Tendencies in Stable Complex Systems	"  A commonly used approach to study stability in a complex system is by
analyzing the Jacobian matrix at an equilibrium point of a dynamical system.
The equilibrium point is stable if all eigenvalues have negative real parts.
Here, by obtaining eigenvalue bounds of the Jacobian, we show that stable
complex systems will favor mutualistic and competitive relationships that are
asymmetrical (non-reciprocative) and trophic relationships that are symmetrical
(reciprocative). Additionally, we define a measure called the interdependence
diversity that quantifies how distributed the dependencies are between the
dynamical variables in the system. We find that increasing interdependence
diversity has a destabilizing effect on the equilibrium point, and the effect
is greater for trophic relationships than for mutualistic and competitive
relationships. These predictions are consistent with empirical observations in
ecology. More importantly, our findings suggest stabilization algorithms that
can apply very generally to a variety of complex systems.

1512.07644	q-bio	q-bio.TO physics.bio-ph q-bio.CB q-bio.PE	"Governing equations of tissue modelling and remodelling: A unified
  generalised description of surface and bulk balance"	"  Several biological tissues undergo changes in their geometry and in their
bulk material properties by modelling and remodelling processes. Modelling
synthesises tissue in some regions and removes tissue in others. Remodelling
overwrites old tissue material properties with newly formed, immature tissue
properties. As a result, tissues are made up of different ""patches"", i.e.,
adjacent tissue regions of different ages and different material properties,
within evolving boundaries. In this paper, generalised equations governing the
spatio-temporal evolution of such tissues are developed within the continuum
model. These equations take into account nonconservative, discontinuous surface
mass balance due to creation and destruction of material at moving interfaces,
and bulk balance due to tissue maturation. These equations make it possible to
model patchy tissue states and their evolution without explicitly maintaining a
record of when/where resorption and formation processes occurred. The time
evolution of spatially averaged tissue properties is derived systematically by
integration. These spatially-averaged equations cannot be written in closed
form as they retain traces that tissue destruction is localised at tissue
boundaries.
  The formalism developed in this paper is applied to bone tissues, which
exhibit strong material heterogeneities due to their slow mineralisation and
remodelling processes. Evolution equations are proposed in particular for
osteocyte density and bone mineral density. Effective average equations for
bone mineral density (BMD) and tissue mineral density (TMD) are derived using a
mean-field approximation. The error made by this approximation when remodelling
patchy tissue is investigated. The specific time signatures of BMD or TMD
during remodelling events may provide a way to detect these events occurring at
lower, unseen spatial resolutions from microCT scans.

1512.07810	q-bio	q-bio.BM	Computational Crystallization	"  Crystallization is a key step in macromolecular structure determination by
crystallography. While a robust theoretical treatment of the process is
available, due to the complexity of the system, the experimental process is
still largely one of trial and error. In this article, efforts in the field are
discussed together with a theoretical underpinning using a solubility phase
diagram. Prior knowledge has been used to develop tools that computationally
predict the crystallization outcome and define mutational approaches that
enhance the likelihood of crystallization. For the most part these tools are
based on binary outcomes (crystal or no crystal), and the full information
contained in an assembly of crystallization screening experiments is lost. The
potential of this additional information is illustrated by examples where new
biological knowledge can be obtained and where a target can be sub-categorized
to predict which class of reagents provides the crystallization driving force.
Computational analysis of crystallization requires complete and correctly
formatted data. While massive crystallization screening efforts are under way,
the data available from many of these studies are sparse. The potential for
this data and the steps needed to realize this potential are discussed.

1512.07864	q-bio	q-bio.SC	"A mechanistic first--passage time framework for bacterial cell-division
  timing"	"  How exponentially growing cells maintain size homeostasis is an important
fundamental problem. Recent single-cell studies in prokaryotes have uncovered
the adder principle, where cells on average, add a fixed size (volume) from
birth to division. Interestingly, this added volume differs considerably among
genetically-identical newborn cells with similar sizes suggesting a stochastic
component in the timing of cell-division. To mechanistically explain the adder
principle, we consider a time-keeper protein that begins to get stochastically
expressed after cell birth at a rate proportional to the volume. Cell-division
time is formulated as the first-passage time for protein copy numbers to hit a
fixed threshold. Consistent with data, the model predicts that while the mean
cell-division time decreases with increasing size of newborns, the noise in
timing increases with size at birth. Intriguingly, our results show that the
distribution of the volume added between successive cell-division events is
independent of the newborn cell size. This was dramatically seen in
experimental studies, where histograms of the added volume corresponding to
different newborn sizes collapsed on top of each other. The model provides
further insights consistent with experimental observations: the distributions
of the added volume and the cell-division time when scaled by their respective
means become invariant of the growth rate. Finally, we discuss various
modifications to the proposed model that lead to deviations from the adder
principle. In summary, our simple yet elegant model explains key experimental
findings and suggests a mechanism for regulating both the mean and fluctuations
in cell-division timing for size control.

  X-ray Scattering (WAXS) Experiments to Molecular Dynamics Simulations"	"  Wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) is emerging as a powerful tool for
increasing the resolution of solution structure measurements of biomolecules.
Compared to its better known complement, small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS),
WAXS targets higher scattering angles and can enhance structural studies of
molecules by accessing finer details of solution structures. Although the
extension from SAXS to WAXS is easy to implement experimentally, the
computational tools required to fully harness the power of WAXS are still under
development. Currently, WAXS is employed to study structural changes and ligand
binding in proteins; however the methods are not as fully developed for nucleic
acids. Here, we show how WAXS can qualitatively characterize nucleic acid
structures as well as the small but significant structural changes driven by
the addition of multivalent ions. We show the potential of WAXS to test
all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and to provide insight in
understanding how the trivalent ion cobalt(III) hexammine (CoHex) affects the
structure of RNA and DNA helices. We find that MD simulations capture the RNA
structural change that occurs due to addition of CoHex.

huge variety of tasks at the molecular level, such as recognition, signalling,
copy, transport, ... The protein sequences realizing a given function may
largely vary across organisms, giving rise to a protein family. Here, we
estimate the entropy of those families based on different approaches, including
Hidden Markov Models used for protein databases and inferred statistical models
reproducing the low-order (1-and 2-point) statistics of multi-sequence
alignments. We also compute the entropic cost, that is, the loss in entropy
resulting from a constraint acting on the protein, such as the fixation of one
particular amino-acid on a specific site, and relate this notion to the escape
probability of the HIV virus. The case of lattice proteins, for which the
entropy can be computed exactly, allows us to provide another illustration of
the concept of cost, due to the competition of different folds. The relevance
of the entropy in relation to directed evolution experiments is stressed.

1512.08305	q-bio	q-bio.TO	"Design Principles of Pancreatic Islets: Glucose-dependent Coordination
  of Hormone Pulses"	"  Pancreatic islets are functional units involved in glucose homeostasis. The
multicellular system comprises three main cell types; $\beta$ and $\alpha$
cells reciprocally decrease and increase blood glucose by producing insulin and
glucagon pulses, while the role of $\delta$ cells is less clear. Although their
spatial organization and the paracrine/autocrine interactions between them have
been extensively studied, the functional implications of the design principles
are still lacking. In this study, we formulated a mathematical model that
integrates the pulsatility of hormone secretion and the interactions and
organization of islet cells and examined the effects of different cellular
compositions and organizations in mouse and human islets. A common feature of
both species was that islet cells produced synchronous hormone pulses under
low- and high- glucose conditions, while they produced asynchronous hormone
pulses under normal glucose conditions. However, the synchronous coordination
of insulin and glucagon pulses at low glucose was more pronounced in human
islets that had more $\alpha$ cells. When $\beta$ cells were selectively
removed to mimic diabetic conditions, the anti-synchronicity of insulin and
glucagon pulses was deteriorated at high glucose, but it could be partially
recovered when the re-aggregation of remaining cells was considered. Finally,
the third cell type, $\delta$ cells, which introduced additional complexity in
the multicellular system, prevented the excessive synchronization of hormone
pulses. Our computational study suggests that controllable synchronization is a
design principle of pancreatic islets.

  Using Directed Information"	"  In this paper, we developed a model-based and a data-driven estimator for
directed information (DI) to infer the causal connectivity graph between
electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals recorded from brain and to identify the
seizure onset zone (SOZ) in epileptic patients. Directed information, an
information theoretic quantity, is a general metric to infer causal
connectivity between time-series and is not restricted to a particular class of
models unlike the popular metrics based on Granger causality or transfer
entropy. The proposed estimators are shown to be almost surely convergent.
Causal connectivity between ECoG electrodes in five epileptic patients is
inferred using the proposed DI estimators, after validating their performance
on simulated data. We then proposed a model-based and a data-driven SOZ
identification algorithm to identify SOZ from the causal connectivity inferred
using model-based and data-driven DI estimators respectively. The data-driven
SOZ identification outperforms the model-based SOZ identification algorithm
when benchmarked against visual analysis by neurologist, the current clinical
gold standard. The causal connectivity analysis presented here is the first
step towards developing novel non-surgical treatments for epilepsy.

1512.08328	q-bio	q-bio.MN physics.bio-ph	Role of spatial averaging in multicellular gradient sensing	"  Gradient sensing underlies important biological processes including
morphogenesis, polarization, and cell migration. The precision of gradient
sensing increases with the length of a detector (a cell or group of cells) in
the gradient direction, since a longer detector spans a larger range of
concentration values. Intuition from analyses of concentration sensing suggests
that precision should also increase with detector length in the direction
transverse to the gradient, since then spatial averaging should reduce the
noise. However, here we show that, unlike for concentration sensing, the
precision of gradient sensing decreases with transverse length for the simplest
gradient sensing model, local excitation--global inhibition (LEGI). The reason
is that gradient sensing ultimately relies on a subtraction of measured
concentration values. While spatial averaging indeed reduces the noise in these
measurements, which increases precision, it also reduces the covariance between
the measurements, which results in the net decrease in precision. We
demonstrate how a recently introduced gradient sensing mechanism, regional
excitation--global inhibition (REGI), overcomes this effect and recovers the
benefit of transverse averaging. Using a REGI-based model, we compute the
optimal two- and three-dimensional detector shapes, and argue that they are
consistent with the shapes of naturally occurring gradient-sensing cell
populations.

However, each has limitations when annotating MSn data with thousands of MS

the Glycomic Elucidation and Annotation Tool (GELATO). This tool extends and
automates the functionality of existing open source projects, namely,
GlycoWorkbench (GWB) and GlycomeDB. The second is a machine learning model
called Smart Anotation Enhancement Graph (SAGE), which learns the behavior of
glycoanalysts to select annotations generated by GELATO that emulate human

1512.08470	q-bio	cond-mat.soft q-bio.BM	"Force-dependent switch in protein unfolding pathways and transition
  state movements"	"  Although known that single domain proteins fold and unfold by parallel
pathways, demonstration of this expectation has been difficult to establish in
experiments. Unfolding rate, $k_\mathrm{u}(f)$, as a function of force $f$,
obtained in single molecule pulling experiments on src SH3 domain, exhibits
upward curvature on a $\log k_\mathrm{u}(f)$ plot. Similar observations were
reported for other proteins for the unfolding rate $k_\mathrm{u}([C])$. These
findings imply unfolding in these single domain proteins involves a switch in
the pathway as $f$ or $[C]$ is increased from a low to a high value. We provide
a unified theory demonstrating that if $\log k_\mathrm{u}$ as a function of a
perturbation ($f$ or $[C]$) exhibits upward curvature then the underlying
energy landscape must be strongly multidimensional. Using molecular simulations
we provide a structural basis for the switch in the pathways and dramatic
shifts in the transition state ensemble (TSE) in src SH3 domain as $f$ is
increased. We show that a single point mutation shifts the upward curvature in
$\log k_\mathrm{u}(f)$ to a lower force, thus establishing the malleability of
the underlying folding landscape. Our theory, applicable to any perturbation
that affects the free energy of the protein linearly, readily explains movement
in the TSE in a $\beta$-sandwich (I27) protein and single chain monellin as the
denaturant concentration is varied. We predict that in the force range
accessible in laser optical tweezer experiments there should be a switch in the
unfolding pathways in I27 or its mutants.

dynamic network of the \textit{Caenorhabditis elegans} soil worm, given by the
connectome of its large somatic nervous system. Our analysis is inspired by a
realistic experiment where one stimulates externally specific parts of the
brain and studies the persistent neural activity triggered in other cortical
regions. In this work, we perturb groups of neurons that form communities,
identified by the walktrap community detection method, by trains of
stereotypical electrical Poissonian impulses and study the propagation of
neural activity to other communities by measuring the corresponding dynamic
ranges and Steven law exponents. We show that when one perturbs specific
communities, keeping the rest unperturbed, the external stimulations are able
to propagate to some of them but not to all. There are also perturbations that
do not trigger any response. We found that this depends on the initially
perturbed community. Finally, we relate our findings for the former cases with
low neural synchronization, self-criticality and large information flow
capacity, and interpret them as the ability of the brain network to respond to
external perturbations when it works at criticality and its information flow
capacity becomes maximal.

  mutations in a leukemia gene regulatory network"	"  The diverse, specialized genes in today's lifeforms evolved from a common
core of ancient, elementary genes. However, these genes did not evolve
individually: gene expression is controlled by a complex network of
interactions, and alterations in one gene may drive reciprocal changes in its
proteins' binding partners. We show that the topology of a leukemia gene
regulatory network is strongly coupled with evolutionary properties.
Slowly-evolving (""cold""), old genes tend to interact with each other, as do
rapidly-evolving (""hot""), young genes, causing genes to evolve in clusters. We
argue that gene duplication placed old, cold genes at the center of the
network, and young, hot genes on the periphery, and demonstrate this with
single-node centrality measures and two new measures of efficiency. Integrating
centrality measures with evolutionary information, we define a
medically-relevant ""cancer network core,"" strongly enriched for common cancer
mutations ($p=2\times 10^{-14}$). This could aid in identifying driver
mutations and therapeutic targets.

  idiotypes: Applications to autoimmunity and immunodeficiency"	"  In spite of their many facets, the phenomena of autoimmunity and
immunodeficiency seem to be related to each other through the subtle links
connecting retroviral mutation and action to immune response and adaptation. In
a previous work, we introduced a network model of how a set of interrelated
genotypes (called a quasispecies, in the stationary state) and a set of
interrelated idiotypes (an idiotypic network) interact. That model, which does
not cover the case of a retroviral quasispecies, was instrumental for the study
of quasispecies survival when confronting the immune system and led to the
conclusion that, unlike what happens when a quasispecies is left to evolve by
itself, letting genotypes mutate too infrequently leads to the destruction of
the quasispecies. Here we extend that genotype-idiotype interaction model by
the addition of a further parameter ($\nu$) to account for the action of
retroviruses (i.e., the destruction of idiotypes by genotypes). We give
simulation results within a suitable parameter niche, highlighting the issues
of quasispecies survival and of the onset of autoimmunity through the
appearance of the so-called pathogenic idiotypes. Our main findings refer to
how $\nu$ and $\lambda$, a parameter describing the rate at which idiotypes get
stimulated, relate to each other. While for $\nu>\lambda$ the quasispecies
survives at the expense of weakening the immune system significantly or even
destroying it, for $\nu<\lambda$ the fittest genotypes of the quasispecies
become mimicked inside the immune system as pathogenic idiotypes. The latter is
in agreement with the current understanding of the HIV quasispecies.

major cause of stroke and dementia, costing many lives and many billions of
pounds each year in the UK alone. This regulatory system, known as cerebral
autoregulation, has been the subject of much experimental and mathematical
investigation yet our understanding of it is still quite limited. One area in
which our understanding is particularly lacking is that of the role of nitric
oxide, understood to be a potent vasodilator. The interactions of nitric oxide
with the better understood myogenic response remain un-modelled and poorly
understood. In this thesis we present a novel model of the arteriolar control
mechanism, comprising a mixture of well-established and new models of
individual processes, brought together for the first time. We show that this
model is capable of reproducing experimentally observed behaviour very closely
and go on to investigate its stability in the context of the vasculature of the
whole brain. In conclusion we find that nitric oxide, although it plays a
central role in determining equilibrium vessel radius, is unimportant to the
dynamics of the system and its responses to variation in arterial blood
pressure. We also find that the stability of the system is very sensitive to
the dynamics of Ca$^{2+}$ within the muscle cell, and that self-sustaining
Ca$^{2+}$ waves are not necessary to cause whole-vessel radius oscillations
consistent with vasomotion.

  and Symmetry Breaking Driven by a Gbetagamma- Mediated, Galpha2-Ric8 --
  Dependent Signal Transduction Network"	"  Many eukaryotic cells, including Dictyostelium discoideum (Dicty),
neutrophils and other cells of the immune system, can detect and reliably
orient themselves in chemoattractant gradients. In Dicty, signal detection and
transduction involves a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) through which
extracellular cAMP signals are transduced into Ras activation via an
intermediate heterotrimeric G-protein (G2). Ras activation is the first
polarized response to cAMP gradients in Dicty. Recent work has revealed mutiple
new characteristics of Ras activation in Dicty, thereby providing new insights
into direction sensing mechanisms and pointing to the need for new models of
chemotaxis. Here we propose a novel reaction-diffusion model of Ras activation
based on three major components: one involving the GPCR, one centered on G2,
and one involving the monomeric G protein Ras. In contrast to existing local
excitation, global inhibition (LEGI) models of direction sensing, in which a
fast-responding but slowly-diffusing activator and a slow-acting rapidly
diffusing inhibitor set up an internal gradient of activity, our model is based
on equal diffusion coefficients for all cytosolic species, and the unbalanced
local sequestration of some species leads to gradient sensing and
amplification. We show that Ric8-modulated G2 cycling between the cytosol and
membrane can account for many of the observed responses in Dicty. including
imperfect adaptation, multiple phases of Ras activity in a cAMP gradient,
rectified directional sensing, and cellular memory.

adaptation, in which the reaction network is viewed as an input-output system.
Given a step change in input, Sensitivity is a measure of the magnitude of the
response, while Precision is a measure of the degree to which the system
returns to its original output for large time. High values of both are
necessary for high-quality adaptation.
  We focus on reaction networks without dissipation, which we interpret as
detailed-balance, mass-action networks. We give various upper and lower bounds
on the optimal values of Sensitivity and Precision, characterized in terms of
the stoichiometry, by using a combination of ideas from matroid theory and
differential-equation theory.
  Among other results, we show that this class of non-dissipative systems
contains networks with arbitrarily high values of both Sensitivity and
Precision. This good performance does come at a cost, however, since certain
ratios of concentrations need to be large, the network has to be extensive, or
the network should show strongly different time scales.

1601.00334	q-bio	q-bio.NC physics.data-an	Pairwise Network Information and Nonlinear Correlations	"  Reconstructing the structural connectivity between interacting units from
observed activity is a challenge across many different disciplines. The
fundamental first step is to establish whether or to what extent the
interactions between the units can be considered pairwise and, thus, can be
modeled as an interaction network with simple links corresponding to pairwise
interactions. In principle this can be determined by comparing the maximum
entropy given the bivariate probability distributions to the true joint
entropy. In many practical cases this is not an option since the bivariate
distributions needed may not be reliably estimated, or the optimization is too
computationally expensive. Here we present an approach that allows one to use
mutual informations as a proxy for the bivariate distributions. This has the
advantage of being less computationally expensive and easier to estimate. We
achieve this by introducing a novel entropy maximization scheme that is based
on conditioning on entropies and mutual informations. This renders our approach
typically superior to other methods based on linear approximations. The
advantages of the proposed method are documented using oscillator networks and
a resting-state human brain network as generic relevant examples.

1601.00364	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Direct Estimation of Firing Rates from Calcium Imaging Data	"  Two-photon imaging of calcium indicators allows simultaneous recording of
responses of hundreds of neurons over hours and even days, but provides a
relatively indirect measure of their spiking activity. Existing deconvolution
algorithms attempt to recover spikes from observed imaging data, which are then
commonly subjected to the same analyses that are applied to
electrophysiologically recorded spikes (e.g., estimation of average firing
rates, or tuning curves). Here we show, however, that in the presence of noise
this approach is often heavily biased. We propose an alternative analysis that
aims to estimate the underlying rate directly, by integrating over the
unobserved spikes instead of committing to a single estimate of the spike
train. This approach can be used to estimate average firing rates or tuning
curves directly from the imaging data, and is sufficiently flexible to
incorporate prior knowledge about tuning structure. We show that directly
estimated rates are more accurate than those obtained from averaging of spikes
estimated through deconvolution, both on simulated data and on imaging data
acquired in mouse visual cortex.

  interactions"	"  The self-assembly of proteins into $\beta$-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils has
been observed to occur with sigmoidal kinetics, indicating that the system
initially is trapped in a metastable state. Here, we use a minimal
lattice-based model to explore the thermodynamic forces driving amyloid
formation in a finite canonical ($NVT$) system. By means of
generalized-ensemble Monte Carlo techniques and a semi-analytical method, the
thermodynamic properties of this model are investigated for different sets of
intersheet interaction parameters. When the interactions support lateral growth
into multi-layered fibrillar structures, an evaporation/condensation transition
is observed, between a supersaturated solution state and a thermodynamically
distinct state where small and large fibril-like species exist in equilibrium.
Intermediate-size aggregates are statistically suppressed. These properties do
not hold if aggregate growth is one-dimensional.

1601.00496	q-bio	stat.AP q-bio.NC stat.ML	Nonparametric Modeling of Dynamic Functional Connectivity in fMRI Data	"  Dynamic functional connectivity (FC) has in recent years become a topic of
interest in the neuroimaging community. Several models and methods exist for
both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography
(EEG), and the results point towards the conclusion that FC exhibits dynamic
changes. The existing approaches modeling dynamic connectivity have primarily
been based on time-windowing the data and k-means clustering. We propose a
non-parametric generative model for dynamic FC in fMRI that does not rely on
specifying window lengths and number of dynamic states. Rooted in Bayesian
statistical modeling we use the predictive likelihood to investigate if the
model can discriminate between a motor task and rest both within and across
subjects. We further investigate what drives dynamic states using the model on
the entire data collated across subjects and task/rest. We find that the number
of states extracted are driven by subject variability and preprocessing
differences while the individual states are almost purely defined by either
task or rest. This questions how we in general interpret dynamic FC and points
to the need for more research on what drives dynamic FC.

tissue repair asks for a sound understanding of underlying principles and
mechanisms. Here, we address recent in vitro experiments on cell monolayers
which show that the advancement of the leading edge relies on cell
proliferation and protrusive activity at the tissue margin. Within a simple
viscoelastic mechanical model amenable to detailed analysis, we identify a key
parameter responsible for tissue expansion, and we determine the dependence of
the monolayer velocity as a function of measurable rheological parameters. Our
results allow us to discuss the effects of pharmacological perturbations on the
observed tissue dynamics.

equations may vary significantly depending upon boundary and initial
conditions, as well as in the spatial dependence of the coefficients involved.
From an extensive numerical study of the BVAM model, we demonstrate that the
geometric pattern of a reaction-diffusion system is not uniquely determined by
the value of the parameters in the equation. From this result, we suggest that
the variability of patterns among individuals of the same species may have its
roots in this sensitivity. Furthermore, this study analyzes briefly how the
inclusion of the advection and the space dependency in the parameters of the
model influences the forms of a specific pattern. The results of this study are
compared to the skin patterns that appear in Pseudoplatystom} fishes.

1601.00720	q-bio	q-bio.NC cs.AI	"How do neurons operate on sparse distributed representations? A
  mathematical theory of sparsity, neurons and active dendrites"	"  We propose a formal mathematical model for sparse representations and active
dendrites in neocortex. Our model is inspired by recent experimental findings
on active dendritic processing and NMDA spikes in pyramidal neurons. These
experimental and modeling studies suggest that the basic unit of pattern memory
in the neocortex is instantiated by small clusters of synapses operated on by
localized non-linear dendritic processes. We derive a number of scaling laws
that characterize the accuracy of such dendrites in detecting activation
patterns in a neuronal population under adverse conditions. We introduce the
union property which shows that synapses for multiple patterns can be randomly
mixed together within a segment and still lead to highly accurate recognition.
We describe simulation results that provide further insight into sparse
representations as well as two primary results. First we show that pattern
recognition by a neuron with active dendrites can be extremely accurate and
robust with high dimensional sparse inputs even when using a tiny number of
synapses to recognize large patterns. Second, equations representing
recognition accuracy of a dendrite predict optimal NMDA spiking thresholds
under a generous set of assumptions. The prediction tightly matches NMDA
spiking thresholds measured in the literature. Our model matches many of the
known properties of pyramidal neurons. As such the theory provides a
mathematical framework for understanding the benefits and limits of sparse
representations in cortical networks.

1601.00756	q-bio	q-bio.QM	"Probabilistic Nearest Neighbor Estimation of Diffusion Constants from
  Single Molecular Measurement without Explicit Tracking"	"  Time course measurement of single molecules on a cell surface provides
detailed information on the dynamics of the molecules, which is otherwise
inaccessible. To extract the quantitative information, single particle tracking
(SPT) is typically performed. However, trajectories extracted by SPT inevitably
have linking errors when the diffusion speed of single molecules is high
compared to the scale of the particle density. To circumvent this problem we
developed an algorithm to estimate diffusion constants without relying on SPT.
We demonstrated that the proposed algorithm provides reasonable estimation of
diffusion constants even when other methods fail due to high particle density
or inhomogeneous particle distribution. In addition, our algorithm can be used
for visualization of time course data from single molecular measurements.

1601.00891	q-bio	q-bio.QM	"An expanded evaluation of protein function prediction methods shows an
  improvement in accuracy"	"  Background: The increasing volume and variety of genotypic and phenotypic
data is a major defining characteristic of modern biomedical sciences. At the
same time, the limitations in technology for generating data and the inherently
stochastic nature of biomolecular events have led to the discrepancy between
the volume of data and the amount of knowledge gleaned from it. A major
bottleneck in our ability to understand the molecular underpinnings of life is
the assignment of function to biological macromolecules, especially proteins.
While molecular experiments provide the most reliable annotation of proteins,
their relatively low throughput and restricted purview have led to an
increasing role for computational function prediction. However, accurately
assessing methods for protein function prediction and tracking progress in the
field remain challenging. Methodology: We have conducted the second Critical
Assessment of Functional Annotation (CAFA), a timed challenge to assess
computational methods that automatically assign protein function. One hundred
twenty-six methods from 56 research groups were evaluated for their ability to
predict biological functions using the Gene Ontology and gene-disease
associations using the Human Phenotype Ontology on a set of 3,681 proteins from
18 species. CAFA2 featured significantly expanded analysis compared with CAFA1,
with regards to data set size, variety, and assessment metrics. To review
progress in the field, the analysis also compared the best methods
participating in CAFA1 to those of CAFA2. Conclusions: The top performing
methods in CAFA2 outperformed the best methods from CAFA1, demonstrating that
computational function prediction is improving. This increased accuracy can be
attributed to the combined effect of the growing number of experimental
annotations and improved methods for function prediction.

1601.00979	q-bio	q-bio.TO cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.bio-ph	Fracture toughness of leaves: Overview and observations	"  One might ask why is it important to know the mechanism of fracture in leaves
when Mother Nature is doing her job perfectly. I could list the following
reasons to address that question: (a) Leaves are natural composite structures,
during millions of years of evolution, they have adapted themselves to their
surrounding environment and their design is optimized, one can apply the
knowledge gained from studying the fracture mechanism of leaves to the
development of new composite materials; (b) Other soft tissues like skin and
blood vessel have similar structure at some scales and may possess the same
fracture mechanism. The gained knowledge can also be applied to these
materials; (c) Global need for food is skyrocketing. There are few countries,
including the United States, that have all the potentials (i.e. water, soil,
sunlight, and manpower) to play a major role in the future world food supplying
market. If we can increase the output of our farms and forests, by means of
protecting them against herbivores [Beck 1965], pathogens [Campbell et al.
1980], and other physical damages, our share of the future market will be
higher. It will also enforce our national food security because we will not be
dependent on food import. We do not yet know how much of our farms and forests
output can be saved if we can genetically design tougher materials, but the
whole idea does worth to be studied.

increasingly being employed to treat neurological disorders and to enhance
human performance. Despite the growing interest in brain stimulation as a form
of neuromodulation, much remains unknown about the network-level impact of
these focal perturbations. To study the system wide impact of regional
stimulation, we employ a data-driven computational model of nonlinear brain
dynamics to systematically explore the effects of targeted stimulation.
Validating predictions from network control theory, we uncover the relationship
between regional controllability and the focal versus global impact of
stimulation, and we relate these findings to differences in the underlying
network architecture. Finally, by mapping brain regions to cognitive systems,
we observe that the default mode system imparts large global change despite
being highly constrained by structural connectivity. This work forms an
important step towards the development of personalized stimulation protocols
for medical treatment or performance enhancement.

1601.01048	q-bio	q-bio.QM	Community-Wide Evaluation of Computational Function Prediction	"  A biological experiment is the most reliable way of assigning function to a
protein. However, in the era of high-throughput sequencing, scientists are
unable to carry out experiments to determine the function of every single gene
product. Therefore, to gain insights into the activity of these molecules and
guide experiments, we must rely on computational means to functionally annotate
the majority of sequence data. To understand how well these algorithms perform,
we have established a challenge involving a broad scientific community in which
we evaluate different annotation methods according to their ability to predict
the associations between previously unannotated protein sequences and Gene
Ontology terms. Here we discuss the rationale, benefits and issues associated
with evaluating computational methods in an ongoing community-wide challenge.

organization of the genome consists in extracting information about this
spatial organization, the function and structure of chromatin topological
domains from existing experimental data, in particular, from genome
colocalization (Hi-C) matrices. Here we present an algorithm allowing to reveal
the underlying hierarchical domain structure of a polymer conformation from
analyzing the modularity of colocalization matrices. We also test this
algorithm on several model polymer structures: equilibrium globules, random
fractal globules and regular fractal (Peano) conformations. We define what we
call a spectrum of cluster borders, and show that these spectra behave
strikingly differently for equilibrium and fractal conformations, allowing us
to suggest an additional criterion to identify fractal polymer conformations.

components: cellular, chemical, and mechanical. The cellular component
describes the different chondrocyte states according to the chemicals these
cells release. The chemical component models the change in concentrations of
those chemicals. The mechanical component contains a simulation of pressure

Every bacterium produces signaling molecules, the local concentration of which
triggers a response when a certain threshold is reached. If this response
lowers the motility then an aggregation of bacteria occurs, which differs
fundamentally from standard motility-induced phase separation due to the
long-ranged nature of the concentration of signal molecules. We analyze this
phenomenon analytically and by numerical simulations employing two different
protocols leading to stationary cluster and ring morphologies, respectively.

modeling based on Big Data tools since they reflect the complexity of processes
taking place in human body and its responses to external events. Here we
present studies of fluctuations in facial electromyography (fEMG) and
electrodermal activity (EDA) massive time series and changes of such signals in
the course of emotional stimulation. Zygomaticus major (ZYG, ""smiling"" muscle)
activity, corrugator supercilii (COR, ""frowning""bmuscle) activity, and phasic
skin conductance (PHSC, sweating) levels of 65 participants were recorded
during experiments that involved exposure to emotional stimuli (i.e., IAPS
images, reading and writing messages on an artificial online discussion board).
Temporal Taylor's fluctuations scaling were found when signals for various
participants and during various types of emotional events were compared. Values
of scaling exponents were close to 1, suggesting an external origin of system
dynamics and/or strong interactions between system's basic elements (e.g.,
muscle fibres). Our statistical analysis shows that the scaling exponents
enable identification of high valence and arousal levels in ZYG and COR
signals.

biology provide users with the ability to submit their experimental results as
gene sets for individual analysis. Such queries are kept private, and have
never before been considered as a resource for integrative analysis. By
harnessing gene set query submissions from thousands of users, we aim to
discover biological knowledge beyond the scope of an individual study. In this
work, we investigated a large collection of gene sets submitted to the tool
Enrichr by thousands of users. Based on co-occurrence, we constructed a global
gene-gene association network. We interpret this inferred network as providing
a summary of the structure present in this crowdsourced gene set library, and
show that this network recapitulates known protein-protein interactions and
functional associations between genes. This finding implies that this network
also offers predictive value. Furthermore, we visualize this gene-gene
association network using a new edge-pruning algorithm that retains both the
local and global structures of large-scale networks. Our ability to make
predictions for currently unknown gene associations, that may not be captured
by individual researchers and data sources, is a demonstration of the potential
of harnessing collective knowledge from users of popular tools in the field of
molecular systems biology.

  for understanding higher-order structure in neural data"	"  The language of graph theory, or network science, has proven to be an
exceptional tool for addressing myriad problems in neuroscience. Yet, the use
of networks is predicated on a critical simplifying assumption: that the
quintessential unit of interest in a brain is a dyad -- two nodes (neurons or
brain regions) connected by an edge. While rarely mentioned, this fundamental
assumption inherently limits the types of neural structure and function that
graphs can be used to model. Here, we describe a generalization of graphs that
overcomes these limitations, thereby offering a broad range of new
possibilities in terms of modeling and measuring neural phenomena.
Specifically, we explore the use of \emph{simplicial complexes}, a theoretical
notion developed in the field of mathematics known as algebraic topology, which
is now becoming applicable to real data due to a rapidly growing computational
toolset. We review the underlying mathematical formalism as well as the budding
literature applying simplicial complexes to neural data, from
electrophysiological recordings in animal models to hemodynamic fluctuations in
humans. Based on the exceptional flexibility of the tools and recent
ground-breaking insights into neural function, we posit that this framework has
the potential to eclipse graph theory in unraveling the fundamental mysteries
of cognition.

used to represent reticulate evolution. Unrooted phylogenetic networks form a
special class of such networks, which naturally generalize unrooted
phylogenetic trees. In this paper we define two operations on unrooted
phylogenetic networks, one of which is a generalization of the well-known
nearest-neighbor interchange (NNI) operation on phylogenetic trees. We show
that any unrooted phylogenetic network can be transformed into any other such
network using only these operations. This generalizes the well-known fact that
any phylogenetic tree can be transformed into any other such tree using only
NNI operations. It also allows us to define a generalization of tree space and
to define some new metrics on unrooted phylogenetic networks. To prove our main
results, we employ some fascinating new connections between phylogenetic
networks and cubic graphs that we have recently discovered. Our results should
be useful in developing new strategies to search for optimal phylogenetic
networks, a topic that has recently generated some interest in the literature,
as well as for providing new ways to compare networks.

  conical-shaped microfilters: concept, optimization and design criteria"	"  The ability of detecting and separating CTCs can play a key role in early
cancer detection and treatment. In recent years, there has been growing
interest in using deformability-based CTC separation microfilters due to their
simplicity and low cost. Most of previous studies in this area are mainly based
on experimental work. Although experimental research provides useful insights
in designing CTC separation devices, there is still a lack of design guidelines
based on fundamental understandings of the cell separation process in the
filers. While experimental efforts face challenges especially microfabrication
difficulties, we adopt numerical simulation here to study conical-shaped
microfilters using deformability difference between CTCs and blood cells for
separation process. We use liquid drop model for modeling a CTC passing through
such microfilters. The accuracy of the model in predicting the pressure
signature of the system is validated by comparing with previous experiments.
Pressure-deformability analysis of the cell going through the channel is then
carried out in detail in order to better understand how a CTC behaves
throughout the filtration process. Different system design criteria such as
system throughput and unclogging of the system are discussed. Specifically,
pressure behavior under different system throughput is analyzed. Regarding the
unclogging issue, we define pressure ratio as a key parameter representing the
ability to overcome clogging in such CTC separation devices and investigate the
effect of conical angle on the optimum pressure ratio. Finally, the effect of
unclogging applied pressure on the system performance is examined. Our study
provides detailed understandings of the cell separation process and its
characteristics, which can be used for developing more efficient CTC separation
devices.

  deformation-based CTC microfiltration"	"  Deformation based circulating tumor cell (CTC) microchips are a
representative diagnostic device for early cancer detection. This type of
device usually involves a process of CTC trapping in a confined microgeometry.
Further understanding of the CTC flow regime, as well as the threshold
passing-through pressure is key to the design of deformation based CTC
filtration devices. In the present numerical study, we investigate the
transitional deformation and pressure signature from surface tension dominated
flow to viscous shear stress dominated flow using a droplet model. Regarding
whether CTC fully blocks the channel inlet, we observe two flow regimes: CTC
squeezing and shearing regime. By studying the relation of CTC deformation at
the exact critical pressure point for increasing inlet velocity, three
different types of cell deformation are observed: 1) hemispherical front, 2)
parabolic front, and 3) elongated CTC co-flowing with carrier media. Focusing
on the circular channel, we observe a first increasing and then decreasing
critical pressure change with increasing flow rate. By pressure analysis, the
concept of optimum velocity is proposed to explain the behavior of CTC
filtration and design optimization of CTC filter. Similar behavior is also
observed in channels with symmetrical cross sessions like square and triangular
but not in rectangular channels which only results in decreasing critical
pressure.

well-established Lotka-Volterra models. Using the long-term abundance data

spatially distributed particles or agents. Stochastic reaction-diffusion
processes are widely used to model such behaviour in disciplines ranging from
biology to the social sciences, yet they are notoriously difficult to simulate
and calibrate to observational data. Here we use ideas from statistical physics

stochastic reaction-diffusion process from data. Our solution relies on a
non-trivial connection between stochastic reaction-diffusion processes and
spatio-temporal Cox processes, a well-studied class of models from
computational statistics. This connection leads to an efficient and flexible
algorithm for parameter inference and model selection. Our approach shows
excellent accuracy on numeric and real data examples from systems biology and
epidemiology. Our work provides both insights into spatio-temporal stochastic

typically decrease when subject to mechanical force. However, a plethora of
biological systems exhibit the counter-intuitive phenomenon of catch bonding,
where non-covalent bonds become stronger under externally applied forces. The
quest to understand the origin of catch-bond behavior has lead to the
development of phenomenological and microscopic theories that can
quantitatively recapitulate experimental data. Here, we assess the successes
and limitations of such theories in explaining experimental data. The most
widely applied approach is a phenomenological two-state model, which fits all
of the available data on a variety of complexes: actomyosin,
kinetochore-microtubule, selectin-ligand, and cadherin-catenin binding to
filamentous actin. With a primary focus on the selectin family of cell-adhesion
complexes, we discuss the positives and negatives of phenomenological models
and the importance of evaluating the physical relevance of fitting parameters.
We describe a microscopic theory for selectins, which provides a structural
basis for catch bonds and predicts a crucial allosteric role for residues
Asn82--Glu88. We emphasize the need for new theories and simulations that can
mimic experimental conditions, given the complex response of cell adhesion
complexes to force and their potential role in a variety of biological
contexts.

make such a mission unachievable. In addition, as a result of the enormous
number of required measurements, the estimated network parameters would differ
from the original ones. Here we present a versatile experimental technique,
which enables the study of recurrent neural networks activity while being
capable of dictating the network connectivity and synaptic strengths. This
method is based on the observation that the response of neurons depends solely
on their recent stimulations, a short-term memory. It allows a long-term scheme
of stimulation and recording of a single neuron, to mimic simultaneous activity
measurements of neurons in a recurrent network. Utilization of this technique
demonstrates the spontaneous emergence of cooperative synchronous oscillations,
in particular the coexistence of fast Gamma and slow Delta oscillations, and

spatiotemporal chaos and turbulence. However, in another range of parameters,
we observe a transition from ST to RS states in both 2D or 3D domains and for
both cases (a) and (b). Our studies show that the ST-RS transition and rotation
period of a spiral or scroll wave in the RS state depends on (i) the coupling
strength between myocytes and fibroblasts and (ii) the number of fibroblasts
attached to myocytes. We conclude that myocyte-fibroblast coupling strength and
the number of fibroblasts are more important for the ST-RS transition than the
precise way in which fibroblasts are distributed over myocyte tissue.

  nature's genetic engineering tools and T cell surveillance emergence for
  purging nascent selfish cells"	"  The US and Hungarian statistical records of the years 1900 and 1896,
respectively, before the dramatic medical advances, show 32% and 27% deaths
attributable to infections, whereas only 5% and 2% due to cancer. These data
can be interpreted to mean that (i) the immune system evolved for purging
nascent selfish cells, which establish natural chimerism littering the soma and
the germline by conspecific alien cells and (ii) defense against pathogens that
represent xenogeneic aliens appeared later in evolution.
  `Liberating' T cells from the semantic trap of immunity and the shackles of
the `two-signal' model of T cell activation, we point out theoretical grounds
that the immune response to cancer is conceptually different from the immune
response to infection. We argue for a one-signal model (with stochastic
influences) as the explanation for T cell activation in preference to the
widely accepted two-signal model of co-stimulation. Convincing evidence for our
one-signal model emerged from the widespread autoimmune adverse events in 64.2%
of advanced melanoma patients treated with the anti-CTLA-4 antibody
(ipilimumab) that blocks an immune checkpoint. Harnessing the unleashed
autoimmune power of T cells could be rewarding to defeat cancer. Assuming that
immunization against isogeneic tumors also would be effective is a fallacy.

their durable storage and accessibility an efficient compression algorithm is
paramount. State of the art domain-specific algorithms combine quantization,
Huffman encoding and occasionally domain knowledge. We propose the high
resolution trajectory compression scheme (HRTC) that relies on piecewise linear
functions to approximate quantized trajectories. By splitting the error budget
between quantization and approximation, our approach beats the current state of
the art by several orders of magnitude given the same error tolerance. It
allows storing samples at far less than one bit per sample. It is simple and
fast enough to be integrated into the inner simulation loop, store every time

  constriction chains"	"  Mechanical stress plays an intricate role in gene expression in individual
cells and sculpting of developing tissues. However, systematic methods of
studying how mechanical stress and feedback help to harmonize cellular
activities within a tissue have yet to be developed. Motivated by our
observation of the cellular constriction chains (CCCs) during the initial phase
of ventral furrow formation in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo, we propose
an active granular fluid (AGF) model that provides valuable insights into
cellular coordination in the apical constriction process. In our model, cells
are treated as circular particles connected by a predefined force network, and
they undergo a random constriction process in which the particle constriction
probability P is a function of the stress exerted on the particle by its
neighbors. We find that when P favors tensile stress, constricted particles
tend to form chain-like structures. In contrast, constricted particles tend to
form compact clusters when P favors compression. A remarkable similarity of
constricted-particle chains and CCCs observed in vivo provides indirect
evidence that tensile-stress feedback coordinates the apical constriction
activity. We expect that our particle-based AGF model will be useful in
analyzing mechanical feedback effects in a wide variety of morphogenesis and
organogenesis phenomena.

1601.02709	q-bio	q-bio.NC math.DS	Dynamic signal tracking in a simple V1 spiking model	"  This work is part of an effort to understand the neural basis for our visual
system's ability, or failure, to accurately track moving visual signals. We
consider here a ring model of spiking neurons, intended as a simplified
computational model of a single hypercolumn of the primary visual cortex.
Signals that consist of edges with time-varying orientations localized in space
are considered. Our model is calibrated to produce spontaneous and driven
firing rates roughly consistent with experiments, and our two main findings,
for which we offer dynamical explanation on the level of neuronal interactions,
are the following: (1) We have documented consistent transient overshoots in
signal perception following signal switches due to emergent interactions of the
E- and I-populations, and (2) for continuously moving signals, we have found
that accuracy is considerably lower at reversals of orientation than when
continuing in the same direction (as when the signal is a rotating bar). To
measure performance, we use two metrics, called fidelity and reliability, to
compare signals reconstructed by the system to the ones presented, and to
assess trial-to-trial variability. We propose that the same population
mechanisms responsible for orientation selectivity also impose constraints on
dynamic signal tracking that manifest in perception failures consistent with
psychophysical observations.

characterization of cellular hierarchy in multi-cellular organisms. However,
cell lineage reconstruction is still often associated with significant
uncertainty due to technological constraints. Such uncertainties have not been
taken into account in current methods. We present ECLAIR, a novel computational
method for the statistical inference of cell lineage relationships from
single-cell gene expression data. ECLAIR uses an ensemble approach to improve
the robustness of lineage predictions, and provides a quantitative estimate of
the uncertainty of lineage branchings. We show that the application of ECLAIR
to published datasets successfully reconstructs known lineage relationships and
significantly improves the robustness of predictions. In conclusion, ECLAIR is
a powerful bioinformatics tool for single-cell data analysis. It can be used
for robust lineage reconstruction with quantitative estimate of prediction
accuracy.

such as Capture-C. However it is unclear how such population level data relates
to the organisation within a single cell, and the mechanisms leading to the
observed interactions are still largely obscure. We present a polymer modelling
scheme based on the assumption that chromosome architecture is maintained by
protein bridges which form chromatin loops. To test the model we perform FISH
experiments and also compare with Capture-C data. Starting merely from the
locations of protein binding sites, our model accurately predicts the

1601.02918	q-bio	q-bio.CB q-bio.PE	Spatial self-organization in hybrid models of multicellular adhesion	"  Spatial self-organization emerges in distributed systems exhibiting local
interactions when nonlinearities and the appropriate propagation of signals are
at work. These kinds of phenomena can be modeled with different frameworks,
typically cellular automata or reaction-diffusion systems. A different class of
dynamical processes involves the correlated movement of agents over space,
which can be mediated through chemotactic movement or minimization of cell-cell
interaction energy. A classic example of the latter is given by the formation
of spatially segregated assemblies when cells display differential adhesion.
Here we consider a new class of dynamical models, involving cell adhesion among
two stochastically exchangeable cell states as a minimal model capable of
exhibiting well-defined, ordered spatial patterns. Our results suggest that a
whole space of pattern-forming rules is hosted by the combination of physical
differential adhesion and the value of probabilities modulating cell phenotypic
switching, showing that Turing-like patterns can be obtained without resorting
to reaction-diffusion processes. If the model is expanded allowing cells to
proliferate and die in an environment where diffusible nutrient and toxic waste
are at play, different phases are observed, characterized by regularly spaced
patterns. The analysis of the parameter space reveals that certain phases reach
higher population levels than other modes of organization. A detailed
exploration of the mean-field theory is also presented. Finally we let
populations of cells with different adhesion matrices compete for reproduction,
showing that, in our model, structural organization can improve the fitness of
a given cell population. The implications of these results for ecological and
evolutionary models of pattern formation and the emergence of multicellularity
are outlined.

reconstructing a genome from a set of reads. Its output consists of contigs --
a set of strings that are promised to appear in any genome that could have
generated the reads. From the introduction of contigs 20 years ago, assemblers
have tried to obtain longer and longer contigs, but the following question was
never solved: given a genome graph $G$ (e.g. a de Bruijn, or a string graph),
what are all the strings that can be safely reported from $G$ as contigs? In
this paper we finally answer this question, and also give a polynomial time
algorithm to find them. Our experiments show that these strings, which we call
omnitigs, are 66% to 82% longer on average than the popular unitigs, and 29% of
dbSNP locations have more neighbors in omnitigs than in unitigs.

  Allocation of Grid Cells to Modules in the Entorhinal Cortex"	"  Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex encode the position of an animal in its
environment using spatially periodic tuning curves of varying periodicity.
Recent experiments established that these cells are functionally organized in
discrete modules with uniform grid spacing. Here we develop a theory for
efficient coding of position, which takes into account the temporal statistics
of the animal's motion. The theory predicts a sharp decrease of module
population sizes with grid spacing, in agreement with the trends seen in the
experimental data. We identify a simple scheme for readout of the grid cell
code by neural circuitry, that can match in accuracy the optimal Bayesian
decoder of the spikes. This readout scheme requires persistence over varying
timescales, ranging from ~1ms to ~1s, depending on the grid cell module. Our
results suggest that the brain employs an efficient representation of position
which takes advantage of the spatiotemporal statistics of the encoded variable,
in similarity to the principles that govern early sensory coding.

  Dynamics of Human Visual Object Recognition"	"  The complex multi-stage architecture of cortical visual pathways provides the
neural basis for efficient visual object recognition in humans. However, the
stage-wise computations therein remain poorly understood. Here, we compared
temporal (magnetoencephalography) and spatial (functional MRI) visual brain
representations with representations in an artificial deep neural network (DNN)
tuned to the statistics of real-world visual recognition. We showed that the
DNN captured the stages of human visual processing in both time and space from
early visual areas towards the dorsal and ventral streams. Further
investigation of crucial DNN parameters revealed that while model architecture
was important, training on real-world categorization was necessary to enforce
spatio-temporal hierarchical relationships with the brain. Together our results
provide an algorithmically informed view on the spatio-temporal dynamics of
visual object recognition in the human visual brain.

1601.02974	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Memory Recall and Spike Frequency Adaptation	"  The brain can reproduce memories from partial data; this ability is critical
for memory recall. The process of memory recall has been studied using
auto-associative networks such as the Hopfield model. This kind of model
reliably converges to stored patterns which contain the memory. However, it is
unclear how the behavior is controlled by the brain so that after convergence
to one configuration, it can proceed with recognition of another one. In the
Hopfield model this happens only through unrealistic changes of an effective
global temperature that destabilizes all stored configurations. Here we show
that spike frequency adaptation (SFA), a common mechanism affecting neuron
activation in the brain, can provide state dependent control of pattern
retrieval. We demonstrate this in a Hopfield network modified to include SFA,
and also in a model network of biophysical neurons. In both cases SFA allows
for selective stabilization of attractors with different basins of attraction,
and also for temporal dynamics of attractor switching that is not possible in
standard auto-associative schemes. The dynamics of our models give a plausible
account of different sorts of memory retrieval.

1601.03022	q-bio	cs.HC q-bio.NC	"Riemannian geometry applied to detection of respiratory states from EEG
  signals: the basis for a brain-ventilator interface"	"  During mechanical ventilation, patient-ventilator disharmony is frequently
observed and may result in increased breathing effort, compromising the
patient's comfort and recovery. This circumstance requires clinical
intervention and becomes challenging when verbal communication is difficult. In
this work, we propose a brain computer interface (BCI) to automatically and
non-invasively detect patient-ventilator disharmony from
electroencephalographic (EEG) signals: a brain-ventilator interface (BVI). Our
framework exploits the cortical activation provoked by the inspiratory
compensation when the subject and the ventilator are desynchronized. Use of a
one-class approach and Riemannian geometry of EEG covariance matrices allows
effective classification of respiratory states. The BVI is validated on nine
healthy subjects that performed different respiratory tasks that mimic a
patient-ventilator disharmony. Classification performances, in terms of areas
under ROC curves, are significantly improved using EEG signals compared to
detection based on air flow. Reduction in the number of electrodes that can
achieve discrimination can often be desirable (e.g. for portable BCI systems).
By using an iterative channel selection technique, the Common Highest Order
Ranking (CHOrRa), we find that a reduced set of electrodes (n=6) can slightly
improve for an intra-subject configuration, and it still provides fairly good
performances for a general inter-subject setting. Results support the
discriminant capacity of our approach to identify anomalous respiratory states,
by learning from a training set containing only normal respiratory epochs. The
proposed framework opens the door to brain-ventilator interfaces for monitoring
patient's breathing comfort and adapting ventilator parameters to patient
respiratory needs.

The 20-parameter KD and MZ hydropathicity scales have different thermodynamic

qualitative amino acid phobic and philic binary 2x10 properties that define
quaternary 4x5 subgroups (but not quinary 5x4 subgroups), with the modern MZ

  non-elementary rates"	"  The chemical master equation (CME) is the exact mathematical formulation of
chemical reactions occurring in a dilute and well-mixed volume. The
reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) is a stochastic description of
reaction-diffusion processes on a spatial lattice, assuming well-mixing only on
the length scale of the lattice. It is clear that, for the sake of consistency,
the solution of the RDME of a chemical system should converge to the solution
of the CME of the same system in the limit of fast diffusion: indeed, this has
been tacitly assumed in most literature concerning the RDME. We show that, in
the limit of fast diffusion, the RDME indeed converges to a master equation,
but not necessarily the CME. We introduce a class of propensity functions, such
that if the RDME has propensities exclusively of this class then the RDME
converges to the CME of the same system; while if the RDME has propensities not
in this class then convergence is not guaranteed. These are revealed to be
elementary and non-elementary propensities respectively. We also show that
independent of the type of propensity, the RDME converges to the CME in the
simultaneous limit of fast diffusion and large volumes. We illustrate our
results with some simple example systems, and argue that the RDME cannot be an
accurate description of systems with non-elementary rates.

  exploitation"	"  Proper balance between exploitation and exploration is what makes good
decisions, which achieve high rewards like payoff or evolutionary fitness. The
Infomax principle postulates that maximization of information directs the
function of diverse systems, from living systems to artificial neural networks.
While specific applications are successful, the validity of information as a
proxy for reward remains unclear. Here, we consider the multi-armed bandit
decision problem, which features arms (slot-machines) of unknown probabilities
of success and a player trying to maximize cumulative payoff by choosing the
sequence of arms to play. We show that an Infomax strategy (Info-p) which
optimally gathers information on the highest mean reward among the arms
saturates known optimal bounds and compares favorably to existing policies. The
highest mean reward considered by Info-p is not the quantity actually needed
for the choice of the arm to play, yet it allows for optimal tradeoffs between
exploration and exploitation.

  in reading and successful highlighting of relevant information"	"  Highlighted text in the Internet (i.e. Hypertext) is predominantly blue and
underlined. The percept of these hypertext characteristics were heavily
questioned by applied research and empirical tests resulted in inconclusive
results. The ability to identify blue text in foveal and parafoveal vision was
identified as potentially constrained by the low number of foveally centered
blue light sensitive retinal cells. The present study investigates if foveal
and parafoveal perceptibility of hypertext is reduced during reading. A
silent-sentence reading study with simultaneous eye movement recordings and the
invisible boundary paradigm, which allows the investigation of foveal and
parafoveal perceptibility, separately, was realized. Target words in sentences
were presented in either black or blue and either underlined or normal. No
effect of color and underlining, but a preview benefit could be detected for
first pass reading measures (comparing fixation times after degraded vs. un-
degraded parafoveal previews). Fixation time measures that included re-reading
(i.e., total viewing times) showed, in addition to a preview effect, a reduced
fixation time for not highlighted (black not underlined) in contrast to
highlighted target words (either blue or underlined or both). Thus, the present
pattern reflects no detectable perceptual disadvantage of hyperlink stimuli but
increased attraction of attention resources, after first pass reading, through
highlighting. Blue or underlined text allows readers to easily perceive
hypertext and at the same time readers re-visited hypertext longer as a
consequence of highlighting. On the basis of the present evidence blue
hypertext can be safely recommended to web designers for future use.

interference and neural noise. There is experimental evidence of multiplexing
of sensory information across population of neurons, particularly in the
vertebrate visual and olfactory systems. Recently, it has been discovered that
in lateral intraparietal cortex of the brain, decision signals are multiplexed
with decision-irrelevant visual signals. Furthermore, it is well known that
several cortical neurons exhibit chaotic spiking patterns. Multiplexing of
chaotic neural signals and their successful demultiplexing in the neurons
amidst interference and noise, is difficult to explain. In this work, a novel
compressed sensing model for efficient multiplexing of chaotic neural signals
constructed using the Hindmarsh-Rose spiking model is proposed. The signals are
multiplexed from a pre-synaptic neuron to its neighbouring post-synaptic
neuron, in the presence of $10^4$ interfering noisy neural signals and
demultiplexed using compressed sensing techniques.

account for growth benefit and burden due to expression of the network
proteins. Modifying the model to incorporate galactose transport and basal
Gal1p production allows us to better reproduce experimental observations.
Incorporating the growth rate effect demonstrates how the native network can
optimize growth in different galactose environments. These findings advance our

of resting-state fMRI brain connectivity with a high temporal sensitivity.
Whereas most existing methods often rely on dividing the time-series into
larger segments of data (i.e. so called sliding window techniques), the
point-based method (PBM) proposed here provides an estimate of brain
connectivity at the level of individual sampled time-points. The achieved
increase in temporal sensitivity, together with temporal graph network theory
allowed us to study functional integration between, as well as within,
resting-state networks. Our results show that functional integrations between
two resting-state networks predominately occurs in bursts of activity with
intermittent periods of less connectivity, whereas the functional connectivity
within resting-state networks is characterized by a tonic/periodic connectivity
pattern. Moreover, the point-based approach allowed us to estimate the
persistency of brain connectivity, i.e. the duration of the intrinsic trace or
memory of resting-state connectivity patterns. The described point-based method
of dynamic resting-state functional connectivity allows for a detailed and
expanded view on the temporal dynamics of resting-state connectivity that
provides novel insights into how neuronal information processing is integrated
in the human brain at the level of large-scale networks.

map between physically viable flux configurations and cellular metabolic
phenotypes described, at the most basic level, by the corresponding growth
rates. By sampling the solution space of E. coli's metabolic network, we show
that empirical growth rate distributions recently obtained in experiments at
single-cell resolution can be explained in terms of a trade-off between the
higher fitness of fast-growing phenotypes and the higher entropy of
slow-growing ones. Based on this, we propose a minimal model for the evolution
of a large bacterial population that captures this trade-off. The scaling
relationships observed in experiments encode, in such frameworks, for the same
distance from the maximum achievable growth rate, the same degree of growth
rate maximization, and/or the same rate of phenotypic change. Being grounded on
genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions, these results allow for
multiple implications and extensions in spite of the underlying conceptual
simplicity.

and sliding paradigm this matrix contains useful information about the signals
in a two dimensional image form. Then this representation can be treated either
as an algebraic matrix or as a geometric image. We have shown applications of
both on human multichannel intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG). In the
first application we have shown that for certain patients the highest
eigenvalue of the matrix obtained from the epileptic focal channels goes up
during a seizure. The focus of this paper is on an application of the second
concept, by which we have come up with an automatic seizure detection algorithm
on a publicly available benchmark data. Except for delay in detection in all
other aspects the new algorithm outperformed the detection performance based on
a support vector machine based algorithm. We have also indicated how this

hierarchical model. This allows us to derive corrections that minimize the mean
squared error, an objective that may be important when sample sizes are small.
The statistical framework also highlights the need for quantile normalization,
and provides justification for the use of the sample correlation between the
two reporter expression levels to estimate the percent contribution of
extrinsic noise to the total noise. Finally, we provide a geometric

about the influence of systemic chemotherapy on the development of drug
resistance at metastatic sites. In this work, we use a hybrid spatial model of
tumor response to a DNA damaging drug to study how the development of
chemoresistance in micrometastases depends on the drug dosing schedule. We
separately consider cell populations that harbor pre-existing resistance to the
drug, and those that acquire resistance during the course of treatment. For
each of these independent scenarios, we consider one hypothetical cell line
that is responsive to metronomic chemotherapy, and another that with high
probability cannot be eradicated by a metronomic protocol. Motivated by
experimental work on ovarian cancer xenografts, we consider all possible
combinations of a one week treatment protocol, repeated for three weeks, and
constrained by the total weekly drug dose. Simulations reveal a small number of
fractionated-dose protocols that are at least as effective as metronomic
therapy in eradicating micrometastases with acquired resistance (weak or
strong), while also being at least as effective on those that harbor weakly
pre-existing resistant cells. Given the responsiveness of very different
theoretical cell lines to these few fractionated-dose protocols, these may
represent more effective ways to schedule chemotherapy with the goal of
limiting metastatic tumor progression.

dynamic process driven by nonlinear interactions in the sociocultural school
environment. The impact of food association learning on diet dynamics, inspired
by a pilot study conducted among Arizona children in Pre-Kindergarten to 8th
grades, is used to build simple population-level learning models.
Qualitatively, mathematical studies are used to highlight the possible
ramifications of instruction, learning in nutrition, and health at the
community level. Model results suggest that nutrition education programs at the
population-level have minimal impact on improving eating behaviors, findings
that agree with prior field studies. Hence, the incorporation of food
association learning may be a better strategy for creating resilient
communities of healthy and non-healthy eaters. A \textit{Ratatouille} effect
can be observed when food association learners become food preference learners,
a potential sustainable behavioral change, which in turn, may impact the
overall distribution of healthy eaters. In short, this work evaluates the
effectiveness of population-level intervention strategies and the importance of
institutionalizing nutrition programs that factor in economical, social,
cultural, and environmental elements that mesh well with the norms and values

revealed that circadian clocks can be highly stable, raising the question how
reliably they can be read out. Here, we combine mathematical modeling with
information theory to address the question how accurately a cell can infer the
time from an ensemble of protein oscillations, which are driven by a circadian
clock. We show that the precision increases with the number of oscillations and
their amplitude relative to their noise. Our analysis also reveals that their
exists an optimal phase relation that minimizes the error in the estimate of
time, which depends on the relative noise levels of the protein oscillations.
Lastly, our work shows that cross-correlations in the noise of the protein
oscillations can enhance the mutual information, which suggests that
cross-regulatory interactions between the proteins that read out the clock can
be beneficial for temporal information transmission.

rooms were recorded, with a low rate of hand-hygiene compliance. Both data sets
were used to construct histories and statistics of contacts informed by the use
of hydro-alcoholic solution, or lack thereof, of the involved health-care
workers. Hand-hygiene compliance data strongly enrich the information
concerning contacts among health-care workers, by assigning a 'safe' or
'at-risk' value to each contact. The global contact network can thus be divided
into 'at-risk' and 'safe' contact networks. The combined data could be of high
relevance for outbreak investigation and to inform data-driven models of
nosocomial disease spread.

1601.03649	q-bio	cs.NE q-bio.NC	"Supervised Learning in Spiking Neural Networks for Precise Temporal
  Encoding"	"  Precise spike timing as a means to encode information in neural networks is
biologically supported, and is advantageous over frequency-based codes by
processing input features on a much shorter time-scale. For these reasons, much
recent attention has been focused on the development of supervised learning
rules for spiking neural networks that utilise a temporal coding scheme.
However, despite significant progress in this area, there still lack rules that
have a theoretical basis, and yet can be considered biologically relevant. Here
we examine the general conditions under which synaptic plasticity most
effectively takes place to support the supervised learning of a precise
temporal code. As part of our analysis we examine two spike-based learning
methods: one of which relies on an instantaneous error signal to modify
synaptic weights in a network (INST rule), and the other one on a filtered
error signal for smoother synaptic weight modifications (FILT rule). We test
the accuracy of the solutions provided by each rule with respect to their
temporal encoding precision, and then measure the maximum number of input
patterns they can learn to memorise using the precise timings of individual
spikes as an indication of their storage capacity. Our results demonstrate the
high performance of FILT in most cases, underpinned by the rule's
error-filtering mechanism, which is predicted to provide smooth convergence
towards a desired solution during learning. We also find FILT to be most
efficient at performing input pattern memorisations, and most noticeably when
patterns are identified using spikes with sub-millisecond temporal precision.
In comparison with existing work, we determine the performance of FILT to be
consistent with that of the highly efficient E-learning Chronotron, but with
the distinct advantage that FILT is also implementable as an online method for
increased biological realism.

  Isolation-With-Initial-Migration Model With Potentially Asymmetric Gene Flow"	"  The isolation-with-migration (IM) model is a common tool to make inferences
about the presence of gene flow during speciation, using polymorphism data.
However, Becquet and Przeworski (2009) report that the parameter estimates
obtained by fitting the IM model are very sensitive to the model's assumptions,
including the assumption of constant gene flow until the present. This paper is
concerned with the isolation-with-initial-migration (IIM) model of
Wilkinson-Herbots (2012), which drops precisely this assumption. In the IIM
model, one ancestral population divides into two descendant subpopulations,
between which there is an initial period of gene flow and a subsequent period
of isolation. We derive a fast method of fitting an extended version of the IIM
model, which allows for asymmetric gene flow and unequal subpopulation sizes.
This is a maximum-likelihood method, applicable to observations on the number
of different sites between pairs of DNA sequences from a large number of
independent loci. In addition to obtaining parameter estimates, our method can
also be used to distinguish between alternative models representing different
evolutionary cenarios, by means of likelihood ratio tests. We illustrate the
procedure on pairs of Drosophila sequences from approximately 30,000 loci. The
computing time needed to fit the most complex version of the model to this data
set is only a couple of minutes. The code to fit the IIM model can be found in
the supplementary files of this paper.

  genomes"	"  A plethora of natural, artificial and social systems exist which do not
belong to the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistical-mechanical world, based on the
standard additive entropy $S_{BG}$ and its associated exponential BG factor.
Frequent behaviors in such complex systems have been shown to be closely
related to $q$-statistics instead, based on the nonadditive entropy $S_q$ (with
$S_1=S_{BG}$), and its associated $q$-exponential factor which generalizes the
usual BG one. In fact, a wide range of phenomena of quite different nature
exist which can be described and, in the simplest cases, understood through
analytic (and explicit) functions and probability distributions which exhibit
some universal features. Universality classes are concomitantly observed which
can be characterized through indices such as $q$. We will exhibit here some
such cases, namely concerning the distribution of inter-occurrence (or
inter-event) times in the areas of finance, earthquakes and genomes.

  Nonlinear $q$-Voter Model with Zealotry"	"  We introduce an heterogeneous nonlinear $q$-voter model with zealots and two
types of susceptible voters, and study its non-equilibrium properties when the
population is finite and well mixed. In this two-opinion model, each individual
supports one of two parties and is either a zealot or a susceptible voter of
type $q_1$ or $q_2$. While here zealots never change their opinion, a
$q_i$-susceptible voter ($i=1,2$) consults a group of $q_i$ neighbors at each
time step, and adopts their opinion if all group members agree. We show that
this model violates the detailed balance whenever $q_1 \neq q_2$ and has
surprisingly rich properties. Here, we focus on the characterization of the
model's non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) in terms of its probability
distribution and currents in the distinct regimes of low and high density of
zealotry. We unveil the NESS properties in each of these phases by computing
the opinion distribution and the circulation of probability currents, as well
as the two-point correlation functions at unequal times (formally related to a
""probability angular momentum""). Our analytical calculations obtained in the
realm of a linear Gaussian approximation are compared with numerical results.

1601.03909	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Integrating Theory and Experiment to Explain the Breakdown of Population
  Synchrony in a Complex Microbial Community"	"  We consider the extension of the `Moran effect', where correlated noise
generates synchrony between isolated single species populations, to the study
of synchrony between populations embedded in multi-species communities. In
laboratory experiments on complex microbial communities, comprising both
predators (protozoa) and prey (bacteria), we observe synchrony in abundances
between isolated replicates. A breakdown in synchrony occurs for both predator
and prey as the reactor dilution rate increases, which corresponds to both an
increased rate of input of external resources and an increased effective
mortality though washout. The breakdown is more rapid, however, for the lower
trophic level. We can explain this phenomenon using a mathematical framework
for determining synchrony between populations in multi-species communities at
equilibrium. We assume that there are multiple sources of environmental noise
with different degrees of correlation that affect the individual species
population dynamics differently. The deterministic dynamics can then influence
the degree of synchrony between species in different communities. In the case
of a stable equilibrium community synchrony is controlled by the eigenvalue
with smallest negative real part. Intuitively fluctuations are minimally damped
in this direction. We show that the experimental observations are consistent
with this framework but only for multiplicative noise.

  eigensystem formulation"	"  On the basis of experimental data and mathematical equations in the
literature, we remodel the ionic dynamics of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) as an
eigensystem formulation, which is valid for investigating finite variations of
variables from the equilibrium like in common experimental operations. This
algorithm provides an alternate viewpoint from frequency-domain analysis and
enables one to probe functionalities of SMC's rhythm by means of a
resonance-related mechanism. Numerical results show three types of calcium
oscillations of SMCs in mesenteric arterioles: spontaneous calcium oscillation,
agonist-dependent calcium oscillation, and agonist-dependent calcium spike. For
simple single and double SMCs, we demonstrate properties of synchronization
among complex signals related to calcium oscillations, and show different
correlation relations between calcium and voltage signals for various
synchronization and resonance conditions. For practical cell clusters, our
analyses indicate that the rhythm of SMCs could (1) benefit enhancements of
signal communications among remote cells, (2) respond to a significant calcium
peaking against transient stimulations for triggering globally-oscillating
modes, and (3) characterize the globally-oscillating modes via frog-leap
(non-molecular-diffusion) calcium waves across inhomogeneous SMCs.

  inhibition in mirror symmetry breaking"	"  Applying the constraints dictated by the principle of detailed balance, we
analyze a recent proposal for spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking (SMSB) based
on enantioselective autocatalysis coupled to a linear decay of the enantiomers
and in the presence of reaction noise. We find the racemic state is the final
stable outcome for both deterministic as well as for stochastic dynamics, and
for both well-mixed and small spatially-coupled systems. The racemic outcome
results even when the autocatalytic cycles are driven irreversibly by external
reagents, in manifestly non-equilibrium conditions. Our findings suggest that
first-order autocatalysis coupled to reactions involving \textit{non-linear}
heterochiral dynamics is a necessary pre-condition for any mechanism purporting
to lead to molecular homochirality.

1601.04181	q-bio	q-bio.BM cond-mat.soft physics.bio-ph	Folding PDZ2 domain using the Molecular Transfer Model	"  A major challenge in molecular simulations is to describe
denaturant-dependent folding of proteins order to make direct comparisons with
{\it in vitro} experiments. We use the molecular transfer model, which is
currently the only method that accomplishes this goal albeit
phenomenologically, to quantitatively describe urea-dependent folding of PDZ
domain, which plays a significant role in molecular recognition and signaling.
Experiments show that urea-dependent unfolding rates of the PDZ2 domain exhibit
a downward curvature at high urea concentrations, which has been interpreted by
invoking the presence of a sparsely populated high energy intermediate.
Simulations using the MTM and a coarse-grained model of PDZ2 are used to show
that the intermediate, which has some native-like character, is present in
equilibrium both in the presence and absence of urea. The free energy profiles
show that there are two barriers separating the folded and unfolded states.
Structures of the transition state ensembles, ($TSE1$ separating the unfolded
and $I_{EQ}$ and $TSE2$ separating $I_{EQ}$ and the native state), determined
using the $P_{fold}$ method, show that $TSE1$ is expanded; $TSE2$ and
native-like. Folding trajectories reveal that PDZ2 folds by parallel routes. In
one pathway folding occurs exclusively through $I_1$, which resembles $I_{EQ}$.
In a fraction of trajectories, constituting the second pathway, folding occurs
through a combination of $I_{1}$ and a kinetic intermediate. The radius of
gyration ($R_g^{U}$) of the unfolded state is more compact (by $\sim$ 9\%)
under native conditions. Decrease in $R_g^{U}$ occurs on the time scale on the
order of utmost $\sim$ 20 $\mu s$. The modest decrease in $R_g^{U}$ and the
rapid collapse suggest that high spatial and temporal resolution are needed to
detect compaction in finite-sized proteins.

1601.04183	q-bio	q-bio.NC cs.NE	TrueHappiness: Neuromorphic Emotion Recognition on TrueNorth	"  We present an approach to constructing a neuromorphic device that responds to
language input by producing neuron spikes in proportion to the strength of the
appropriate positive or negative emotional response. Specifically, we perform a
fine-grained sentiment analysis task with implementations on two different
systems: one using conventional spiking neural network (SNN) simulators and the
other one using IBM's Neurosynaptic System TrueNorth. Input words are projected
into a high-dimensional semantic space and processed through a fully-connected
neural network (FCNN) containing rectified linear units trained via
backpropagation. After training, this FCNN is converted to a SNN by
substituting the ReLUs with integrate-and-fire neurons. We show that there is
practically no performance loss due to conversion to a spiking network on a
sentiment analysis test set, i.e. correlations between predictions and human
annotations differ by less than 0.02 comparing the original DNN and its spiking
equivalent. Additionally, we show that the SNN generated with this technique
can be mapped to existing neuromorphic hardware -- in our case, the TrueNorth
chip. Mapping to the chip involves 4-bit synaptic weight discretization and
adjustment of the neuron thresholds. The resulting end-to-end system can take a
user input, i.e. a word in a vocabulary of over 300,000 words, and estimate its
sentiment on TrueNorth with a power consumption of approximately 50 uW.

  human body"	"  The search to understand how the HIV virus spreads inside the human body and
how the immune response works to control it has motivated studies related to
Mathematical Immunology. Actually, researches include the idea of mathematical
models representing the dynamics of healthy and infected cell populations and
focusing on mechanisms used by HIV to invade target-host cells, viral
dissemination (which leads to depletion of the T-cell pool and collapse of the
immune system), and impairment of immune response. In this work, we show the
importance of specific cells of immune response, as infection vectors involved
in the dynamics of viral proliferation within an untreated patient, by using an
ordinary differential equation model in which we considered that the virus
infected target-cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes
TCD4 and TCD8 populations. In conclusion, we demonstrate the importance of each
cell-host and the threshold of viral establishment and posterior spread based
on the presence of infected macrophages and dendritic cells in
antigen-presenting processing, which leads to new infections (by wild or mutant
virions) after immune response activation episodes. We presented an $R_0$
expression that provides the major parameters of HIV infection. Additionally,
we suggest some possibilities of new targets for functional vaccines.

the exact nature of the hippocampal representation of space is still being
explored. Recently, there has been a fair amount of success in modeling
hippocampal spatial maps in rats, assuming a topological perspective on spatial
information processing. In this paper, we use the topological model to study
$3D$ learning in bats, which produces several insights into neurophysiological
mechanisms of the hippocampal spatial mapping. First, we demonstrate functional
importance of the cell assemblies for producing accurate maps of the $3D$
environments. Second, the model suggests that the readout neurons in these cell
assemblies should function as integrators of synaptic inputs, rather than
detectors of place cells' coactivity and allows estimating the integration time
window. Lastly, the model suggests that, in contrast with relatively slow
moving rats, suppressing $\theta$-precession in bats improves the place cells
capacity to encode spatial maps, which is consistent with the experimental
observations.

of the paper is two-fold: we present new graph-theoretic properties of dual
graphs to validate the further analysis and classification of RNAs using these
topological representations; we also present a linear-time algorithm to
partition dual graphs into topological components called {\it blocks} and
determine if each block contains a {\it pseudoknot} or not. We show that a
block contains a pseudoknot if and only if the block has a vertex of degree $3$
or more; this characterization allows us to efficiently isolate smaller RNA
fragments and classify them as pseudoknotted or pseudoknot-free regions, while
keeping these sub-structures intact. Even though non-topological techniques to
detect and classify pseudoknots have been efficiently applied, structural
properties of dual graphs provide a unique perspective for the further analysis
of RNAs. Applications to RNA design can be envisioned since modular building
blocks with intact pseudoknots can be combined to form new
constructs.\end{abstract}

1601.04398	q-bio	math.GR q-bio.PE q-bio.QM	Bacterial phylogeny in the Cayley graph	"  Many models of genome rearrangement involve operations (e.g. inversions and
translocations) that are self-inverse, and hence generate a group acting on the
space of genomes. This gives a correspondence between genome arrangements and
the elements of a group, and consequently, between evolutionary paths and walks
on the Cayley graph. Many common methods for phylogeny reconstruction rely on
calculating the minimal distance between two genomes; this omits much of the
other information available from the Cayley graph. In this paper we begin an
exploration of some of this additional information, in particular describing
the phylogeny as a Steiner tree within the Cayley graph, and exploring the
""interval"" between two genomes. While motivated by problems in systematic
biology, many of these ideas are of independent group-theoretic interest.

  using piecewise evaluation and state estimation"	"  Ordinary differential equations (ODE) are widely used for modeling in Systems
Biology. As most commonly only some of the kinetic parameters are measurable or
precisely known, parameter estimation techniques are applied to parametrize the
model to experimental data. A main challenge for the parameter estimation is
the complexity of the parameter space, especially its high dimensionality and
local minima.
  Parameter estimation techniques consist of an objective function, measuring
how well a certain parameter set describes the experimental data, and an
optimization algorithm that optimizes this objective function. A lot of effort
has been spent on developing highly sophisticated optimization algorithms to
cope with the complexity in the parameter space, but surprisingly few articles
address the influence of the objective function on the computational complexity
in finding global optima. We extend a recently developed multiple shooting for
stochastic systems (MSS) objective function for parameter estimation of
stochastic models and apply it to parameter estimation of ODE models. This MSS
objective function treats the intervals between measurement points separately.
This separate treatment allows the ODE trajectory to stay closer to the data
and we show that it reduces the complexity of the parameter space.
  We use examples from Systems Biology, namely a Lotka-Volterra model, a
FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillator and a Calcium oscillation model, to demonstrate the
power of the MSS approach for reducing the complexity and the number of local
minima in the parameter space. The approach is fully implemented in the COPASI
software package and, therefore, easily accessible for a wide community of
researchers.

flux analysis (MFA-ILE) in isotope labeling experiments. The balance equations
are given by hundreds of algebraic (stationary MFA) or ordinary differential
equations (nonstationary MFA), and reducing the number of operations is
therefore a crucial part of reducing the computation cost. The main bottleneck
for deterministic algorithms is the computation of derivatives, particularly
for nonstationary MFA. In this article we explain how the overall
identification process may be speeded up by using the adjoint approach to
compute the gradient of the residual sum of squares. The proposed approach
shows significant improvements in terms of complexity and computation time when
it is compared with the usual (direct) approach. Numerical results are obtained
for the central metabolic pathways of Escherichia coli and are validated
against reference software in the stationary case. The methods and algorithms

in microbial populations by leading to the division of labour among cells, or
ensuring that at least some of the population survives an unexpected change in
environmental conditions. Here we use a computational model to investigate an
alternative possible function of stochastic phenotype switching - as a way to
adapt more quickly even in a static environment. We show that when a genetic
mutation causes a population to become less fit, switching to an alternative
phenotype with higher fitness (growth rate) may give the population enough time
to develop compensatory mutations that increase the fitness again. The
possibility of switching phenotypes can reduce the time to adaptation by orders
of magnitude if the ""fitness valley"" caused by the deleterious mutation is deep
enough. Our work has important implications for the emergence of
antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In line with recent experimental findings we
hypothesise that switching to a slower growing but less sensitive phenotype
helps bacteria to develop resistance by exploring a larger set of beneficial
mutations while avoiding deleterious ones.

set of $P$ unknown model parameters from $N$ noisy measurements. What are
fundamental limits on the accuracy of parameter inference, given finite
signal-to-noise ratios, limited measurements, prior information, and
computational tractability requirements? How can we combine prior information
with measurements to achieve these limits? Classical statistics gives incisive
answers to these questions as the measurement density $\alpha =
\frac{N}{P}\rightarrow \infty$. However, these classical results are not
relevant to modern high-dimensional inference problems, which instead occur at
finite $\alpha$. We formulate and analyze high-dimensional inference as a
problem in the statistical physics of quenched disorder. Our analysis uncovers
fundamental limits on the accuracy of inference in high dimensions, and reveals
that widely cherished inference algorithms like maximum likelihood (ML) and
maximum-a posteriori (MAP) inference cannot achieve these limits. We further
find optimal, computationally tractable algorithms that can achieve these
limits. Intriguingly, in high dimensions, these optimal algorithms become
computationally simpler than MAP and ML, while still outperforming them. For
example, such optimal algorithms can lead to as much as a 20% reduction in the
amount of data to achieve the same performance relative to MAP. Moreover, our
analysis reveals simple relations between optimal high dimensional inference
and low dimensional scalar Bayesian inference, insights into the nature of
generalization and predictive power in high dimensions, information theoretic
limits on compressed sensing, phase transitions in quadratic inference, and
connections to central mathematical objects in convex optimization theory and

Balanced networks offer a parsimonious model of this variability. In balanced
networks, strong excitatory synaptic inputs are canceled by strong inhibitory
inputs on average and spiking activity is driven by transient breaks in this
balance. Most previous studies of balanced networks assume a homogeneous or
distance-dependent connectivity structure, but connectivity in biological
cortical networks is more intricate. We use a heterogeneous mean-field theory
of balanced networks to show that heterogeneous in-degrees can break balance,
but balance can be restored by heterogeneous out-degrees that are correlated
with in-degrees. In all examples considered, we find that highly connected
neurons spike less frequently, consistent with recent experimental
observations.

contain non-treelike evolutionary events such as hybridization and horizontal
gene transfer. In some cases, such histories can be described by a phylogenetic
base-tree with additional linking arcs, which can for example represent gene
transfer events. Such phylogenetic networks are called tree-based. Here, we
consider two possible generalizations of this concept to nonbinary networks,
which we call tree-based and strictly-tree-based nonbinary phylogenetic
networks. We give simple graph-theoretic characterizations of tree-based and
strictly-tree-based nonbinary phylogenetic networks. Moreover, we show for each
of these two classes that it can be decided in polynomial time whether a given
network is contained in the class. Our approach also provides a new view on
tree-based binary phylogenetic networks. Finally, we discuss two examples of
nonbinary phylogenetic networks in biology and show how our results can be
applied to them.

  Modeling with Covariates"	"  Effective population size characterizes the genetic variability in a
population and is a parameter of paramount importance in population genetics.
Kingman's coalescent process enables inference of past population dynamics
directly from molecular sequence data, and researchers have developed a number
of flexible coalescent-based models for Bayesian nonparametric estimation of
the effective population size as a function of time. A major goal of
demographic reconstruction is understanding the association between the
effective population size and potential explanatory factors. Building upon
Bayesian nonparametric coalescent-based approaches, we introduce a flexible
framework that incorporates time-varying covariates through Gaussian Markov
random fields. To approximate the posterior distribution, we adapt efficient
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms designed for highly structured Gaussian
models. Incorporating covariates into the demographic inference framework
enables the modeling of associations between the effective population size and
covariates while accounting for uncertainty in population histories.
Furthermore, it can lead to more precise estimates of population dynamics. We
apply our model to four examples. We reconstruct the demographic history of
raccoon rabies in North America and find a significant association with the
spatiotemporal spread of the outbreak. Next, we examine the effective
population size trajectory of the DENV-4 virus in Puerto Rico along with viral
isolate count data and find similar cyclic patterns. We compare the population
history of the HIV-1 CRF02_AG clade in Cameroon with HIV incidence and
prevalence data and find that the effective population size is more reflective
of incidence rate. Finally, we explore the hypothesis that the population
dynamics of musk ox during the Late Quaternary period were related to climate
change.

  configurations on a representative rat head model"	"  The curtain of technical limitations impeding rat multichannel non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) has risen. Given the importance of this
preclinical model, development and validation of EEG source imaging (ESI) is
essential. We investigate the validity of well-known human ESI methodologies in
rats which individual tissue geometries have been approximated by those
extracted from an MRI template, leading also to imprecision in electrode
localizations. With the half and fifth sensitivity volumes we determine both
the theoretical minimum electrode separation for non-redundant scalp EEG
measurements and the electrode sensitivity resolution, which vary over the
scalp because of the head geometry. According to our results, electrodes should
be at least ~3-3.5 mm apart for an optimal configuration. The sensitivity
resolution is generally worse for electrodes at the boundaries of the scalp
measured region, though, by analogy with human montages, concentrates the
sensitivity enough to localize sources. Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds of source
localization errors indicate it is theoretically possible to achieve ESI
accuracy at the level of anatomical structures, such as the stimulus-specific
somatosensory areas, using the template. More validation for this approximation
is provided through the comparison between the template and the individual lead
field matrices, for several rats. Finally, using well-accepted inverse methods,
we demonstrate that somatosensory ESI is not only expected but also allows
exploring unknown phenomena related to global sensory integration. Inheriting
the advantages and pitfalls of human ESI, rat ESI will boost the understanding
of brain pathophysiological mechanisms and the evaluation of ESI methodologies,
new pharmacological treatments and ESI-based biomarkers.

  cancer using a network modeling approach"	"  Copy number alterations (CNAs) are thought to account for 85% of the
variation in gene expression observed among breast tumours. The expression of
cis-associated genes is impacted by CNAs occurring at proximal loci of these
genes, whereas the expression of trans-associated genes is impacted by CNAs
occurring at distal loci. While a majority of these CNA-driven genes
responsible for breast tumourigenesis are cis-associated, trans-associated
genes are thought to further abet the development of cancer and influence
disease outcomes in patients. Here we present a network-based approach that
integrates copy-number and expression profiles to identify putative cis- and
trans-associated genes in breast cancer pathogenesis. We validate these cis-
and trans-associated genes by employing them to subtype a large cohort of
breast tumours obtained from the METABRIC consortium, and demonstrate that
these genes accurately reconstruct the ten subtypes of breast cancer. We
observe that individual breast cancer subtypes are driven by distinct sets of
cis- and trans-associated genes. Among the cis-associated genes, we recover
several known drivers of breast cancer (e.g. CCND1, ERRB2, MDM2 and ZNF703) and
some novel putative drivers (e.g. BRF2 and SF3B3). siRNA-mediated knockdown of
BRF2 across a panel of breast cancer cell lines showed significant reduction
specifically in cell proliferation in HER2+ lines, thereby indicating that BRF2
could be a context-dependent oncogene and potentially targetable in these
lines. Among the trans-associated genes, we identify modules of immune-response
(CD2, CD19, CD38 and CD79B), mitotic/cell-cycle kinases (e.g. AURKB, MELK, PLK1
and TTK), and DNA-damage response genes (e.g. RFC4 and FEN1).

  Biological Samples"	"  Comparative transcriptomics has gained increasing popularity in genomic
research thanks to the development of high-throughput technologies including
microarray and next-generation RNA sequencing that have generated numerous
transcriptomic data. An important question is to understand the conservation
and differentiation of biological processes in different species. We propose a
testing-based method TROM (Transcriptome Overlap Measure) for comparing
transcriptomes within or between different species, and provide a different
perspective to interpret transcriptomic similarity in contrast to traditional
correlation analyses. Specifically, the TROM method focuses on identifying
associated genes that capture molecular characteristics of biological samples,
and subsequently comparing the biological samples by testing the overlap of
their associated genes. We use simulation and real data studies to demonstrate
that TROM is more powerful in identifying similar transcriptomes and more
robust to stochastic gene expression noise than Pearson and Spearman
correlations. We apply TROM to compare the developmental stages of six
Drosophila species, C. elegans, S. purpuratus, D. rerio and mouse liver, and
find interesting correspondence patterns that imply conserved gene expression
programs in the development of these species. The TROM method is available as
an R package on CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/) with manuals and source codes
available at http://www.stat.ucla.edu/ jingyi.li/software-and-data/trom.html.

  and reorientation behaviour of collagen fibrres in articular cartilage"	"  In articular cartilage the orientation of collagen fibres is not uniform,
varying mostly with the depth on the tissue. Besides, the biomechanical
response of each layer of the articular cartilage differs from the neighbouring
ones, evolving through thickness as a function of the distribution, density and
orientation of the collagen fibres. Based on a finite element implementation, a
new continuum formulation is proposed to describe the remodelling and
reorientation of the collagen fibres under arbitrary mechanical loads: the
cartilaginous tissue is modelled based on a hyperelastic formulation, being the
ground isotropic matrix described by a neo-Hookean law and the fibrillar
anisotropic part modelled by a new anisotropic formulation introduced for the
first time in the present work, in which both reorientation and remodelling are
taken into account. To characterize the orientation of fibres, a structure
tensor is defined to represent the expected distribution and orientation of
fibres around a reference direction. The isotropic and anisotropic constitutive
parameters were determined by the good validation of the numerical models with
the experimental data available from the literature. Considering the effect of
realistic collagen fibre reorientation in the cartilage tissue, the remodelling
algorithm associated with a distribution of fibres model showed accurate
results with few numerical calculations.

  the assembly of a pollinator community"	"  The foundational concepts behind the persistence of ecological communities
have been based on two ecological properties: dynamical stability and
feasibility. The former is typically regarded as the capacity of a community to
return to an original equilibrium state after a perturbation in species
abundances, and is usually linked to the strength of interspecific
interactions. The latter is the capacity to sustain positive abundances on all
its constituent species, and is linked to both interspecific interactions and
species demographic characteristics. Over the last 40 years, theoretical
research in ecology has emphasized the search for conditions leading to the
dynamical stability of ecological communities, while the conditions leading to
feasibility have been overlooked. However, thus far, we have no evidence of
whether species interactions are more conditioned by the community's need to be
stable or feasible. Here, we introduce novel quantitative methods and use
empirical data to investigate the consequences of species interactions on the
dynamical stability and feasibility of mutualistic communities. First, we
demonstrate that the more nested the species interactions in a community are,
the lower the mutualistic strength that the community can tolerate without
losing dynamical stability. Second, we show that high feasibility in a
community can be reached either with high mutualistic strength or with highly
nested species interactions. Third, we find that during the assembly process of
a seasonal pollinator community located at The Zackenberg Research Station (NE
Greenland), a high feasibility is reached through the nested species
interactions established between newcomer and resident species. Our findings
imply that nested mutualistic communities promote feasibility over stability,
which may suggest that the former can be key for community persistence.

  series"	"  The advent of accessible ancient DNA technology now allows the direct
ascertainment of allele frequencies in ancestral populations, thereby enabling
the use of allele frequency time series to detect and estimate natural
selection. Such direct observations of allele frequency dynamics are expected
to be more powerful than inferences made using patterns of linked neutral
variation obtained from modern individuals. We develop a Bayesian method to
make use of allele frequency time series data and infer the parameters of
general diploid selection, along with allele age, in non-equilibrium
populations. We introduce a novel path augmentation approach, in which we use
Markov chain Monte Carlo to integrate over the space of allele frequency
trajectories consistent with the observed data. Using simulations, we show that
this approach has good power to estimate selection coefficients and allele age.
Moreover, when applying our approach to data on horse coat color, we find that
ignoring a relevant demographic history can significantly bias the results of
inference. Our approach is made available in a C++ software package.

could arise and different growth characteristics of the new tumor are observed.
In order to get a better understanding of the phenomenon, a mathematical model

  songbirds"	"  Animals in groups often exchange calls, in patterns whose temporal structure
may be influenced by contextual factors such as physical location and the
social network structure of the group. We introduce a model-based analysis for
temporal patterns of animal call timing, originally developed for networks of
firing neurons. This has advantages over cross-correlation analysis in that it
can correctly handle common-cause confounds and provides a generative model of
call patterns with explicit parameters for the influences between individuals.
It also has advantages over standard Markovian analysis in that it incorporates
detailed temporal interactions which affect timing as well as sequencing of
calls. Further, a fitted model can be used to generate novel synthetic call
sequences. We apply the method to calls recorded from groups of domesticated
zebra finch (Taenopyggia guttata) individuals. We find that the communication
network in these groups has stable structure that persists from one day to the
next, and that ""kernels"" reflecting the temporal range of influence have a
characteristic structure for a calling individual's effect on itself, its
partner, and on others in the group. We further find characteristic patterns of
influences by call type as well as by individual.

1601.05506	q-bio	q-bio.MN cs.SI	"AptRank: An Adaptive PageRank Model for Protein Function Prediction on
  Bi-relational Graphs"	"  Diffusion-based network models are widely used for protein function
prediction using protein network data and have been shown to outperform
neighborhood- and module-based methods. Recent studies have shown that
integrating the hierarchical structure of the Gene Ontology (GO) data
dramatically improves prediction accuracy. However, previous methods usually
either used the GO hierarchy to refine the prediction results of multiple
classifiers, or flattened the hierarchy into a function-function similarity
kernel. No study has taken the GO hierarchy into account together with the
protein network as a two-layer network model.
  We first construct a Bi-relational graph (Birg) model comprised of both
protein-protein association and function-function hierarchical networks. We
then propose two diffusion-based methods, BirgRank and AptRank, both of which
use PageRank to diffuse information on this two-layer graph model. BirgRank is
an application of traditional PageRank with fixed decay parameters. In
contrast, AptRank uses an adaptive mechanism to improve the performance of
BirgRank. We evaluate both methods in predicting protein function on yeast,
fly, and human datasets, and compare with four previous methods: GeneMANIA,
TMC, ProteinRank and clusDCA. We design three validation strategies: missing
function prediction, de novo function prediction, and guided function
prediction to comprehensively evaluate all six methods. We find that both
BirgRank and AptRank outperform the others, especially in missing function
prediction when using only 10% of the data for training.
  AptRank combines protein-protein associations and the GO function-function
hierarchy into a two-layer network model without flattening the hierarchy into
a similarity kernel. Introducing an adaptive mechanism to the traditional,
fixed-parameter model of PageRank greatly improves the accuracy of protein
function prediction.

two-step cascade $\text{S} \rightarrow \text{X} \rightarrow \text{Y}$. Starting
from a set of Langevin equations obeying Gaussian noise processes we calculate
the variance and covariance while considering both linear and nonlinear
production terms for different biochemical species of the cascade. These
quantities are then used to calculate the net synergy within the purview of
partial information decomposition. We show that redundancy in information
transmission is essentially an important consequence of Markovian property of
the two-step cascade motif. We also show that redundancy increases fidelity of
the signalling pathway.

necessary to account for non-linear terms when working with fractions of
individuals. We also derive the transition probabilities that give rise to such
macroscopic behavior, completing the bottom-up description. Finally, it shown
that the usual assumption of constant population sizes induces a hidden

an important question in ecology. Both demographic and environmental
stochasticity impact a population's ability to persist. Here we explore ways of
including this variability. We study populations which have traditionally been
modelled using a deterministic integrodifference equation (IDE) framework, with
distinct dispersal and sedentary stages. Individual based models (IBMs) are the
most intuitive stochastic analogues to IDEs but yield few analytic insights. We
explore two alternate approaches; one is a scaling up to the population level
using the Central Limit Theorem, and the other a variation on both
Galton-Watson branching processes and branching processes in random
environments. These branching process models closely approximate the IBM and
yield insight into the factors determining the critical domain size for a given
population subject to stochasticity.

  Background Rejection"	"  Ultrasound super-localization microscopy techniques presented in the last few
years enable non-invasive imaging of vascular structures at the capillary level
by tracking the flow of ultrasound contrast agents (gas microbubbles). However,
these techniques are currently limited by low temporal resolution and long
acquisition times. Super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) is a
fluorescence microscopy technique enabling sub-diffraction limit imaging with
high temporal resolution by calculating high order statistics of the
fluctuating optical signal. The aim of this work is to achieve fast acoustic
imaging with enhanced resolution by applying the tools used in SOFI to
contrast-enhance ultrasound (CEUS) plane-wave scans. The proposed method was
tested using numerical simulations and evaluated using two in-vivo rabbit
models: scans of healthy kidneys and VX-2 tumor xenografts. Improved spatial
resolution was observed with a reduction of up to 50% in the full width half
max of the point spread function. In addition, substantial reduction in the
background level was achieved compared to standard mean amplitude persistence
images, revealing small vascular structures within tumors. The scan duration of
the proposed method is less than a second while current superlocalization
techniques require acquisition duration of several minutes. As a result, the
proposed technique may be used to obtain scans with enhanced spatial resolution
and high temporal resolution, facilitating flow-dynamics monitoring. Our method
can also be applied during a breath-hold, reducing the sensitivity to motion
artifacts.

consists of junk DNA, i.e., the fraction of the genome on which selection does
not operate, and garbage DNA, i.e., sequences that lower the fitness of the
organism, but exist in the genome because purifying selection is neither
omnipotent nor instantaneous. In this chapter, I (1) review the concepts of

  diffusion"	"  The two-parameter Poisson--Dirichlet diffusion, introduced in 2009 by Petrov,
extends the infinitely-many-neutral-alleles diffusion model, related to
Kingman's one-parameter Poisson--Dirichlet distribution and to certain
Fleming--Viot processes. The additional parameter has been shown to regulate
the clustering structure of the population, but is yet to be fully understood
in the way it governs the reproductive process. Here we shed some light on
these dynamics by formulating a $K$-allele Wright--Fisher model for a
population of size $N$, involving a uniform mutation pattern and a specific
state-dependent migration mechanism. Suitably scaled, this process converges in
distribution to a $K$-dimensional diffusion process as $N\to\infty$. Moreover,
the descending order statistics of the $K$-dimensional diffusion converge in
distribution to the two-parameter Poisson--Dirichlet diffusion as $K\to\infty$.
The choice of the migration mechanism depends on a delicate balance between
reinforcement and redistributive effects. The proof of convergence to the
infinite-dimensional diffusion is nontrivial because the generators do not
converge on a core. Our strategy for overcoming this complication is to prove
\textit{a priori} that in the limit there is no ""loss of mass"", i.e., that, for
each limit point of the sequence of finite-dimensional diffusions (after a
reordering of components by size), allele frequencies sum to one.

with the potential to provide a means to perform predictions on spatiotemporal
data. The algorithm, inspired by the neocortex, currently does not have a
comprehensive mathematical framework. This work brings together all aspects of
the spatial pooler (SP), a critical learning component in HTM, under a single
unifying framework. The primary learning mechanism is explored, where a maximum
likelihood estimator for determining the degree of permanence update is
proposed. The boosting mechanisms are studied and found to be only relevant
during the initial few iterations of the network. Observations are made
relating HTM to well-known algorithms such as competitive learning and
attribute bagging. Methods are provided for using the SP for classification as
well as dimensionality reduction. Empirical evidence verifies that given the
proper parameterizations, the SP may be used for feature learning.

  with variable sequences"	"  Researches on sequential vocalization often require analysis of vocalizations
in long continuous sounds. In such studies as developmental ones or studies
across generations in which days or months of vocalizations must be analyzed,
methods for automatic recognition would be strongly desired. Although methods
for automatic speech recognition for application purposes have been intensively
studied, blindly applying them for biological purposes may not be an optimal
solution. This is because, unlike human speech recognition, analysis of
sequential vocalizations often requires accurate extraction of timing
information. In the present study we propose automated systems suitable for
recognizing birdsong, one of the most intensively investigated sequential
vocalizations, focusing on the three properties of the birdsong. First, a song
is a sequence of vocal elements, called notes, which can be grouped into
categories. Second, temporal structure of birdsong is precisely controlled,
meaning that temporal information is important in song analysis. Finally, notes
are produced according to certain probabilistic rules, which may facilitate the
accurate song recognition. We divided the procedure of song recognition into
three sub-steps: local classification, boundary detection, and global
sequencing, each of which corresponds to each of the three properties of
birdsong. We compared the performances of several different ways to arrange
these three steps. As results, we demonstrated a hybrid model of a deep neural
network and a hidden Markov model is effective in recognizing birdsong with
variable note sequences. We propose suitable arrangements of methods according
to whether accurate boundary detection is needed. Also we designed the new
measure to jointly evaluate the accuracy of note classification and boundary
detection. Our methods should be applicable, with small modification and
tuning, to the songs in other species that hold the three properties of the
sequential vocalization.

Most interesting finding is that wound pH depends on actual wound size.

widely used to model two-alternative forced choice decisions, and, while simple
formulae for accuracy, mean DT and coefficient of variation are readily
available, third and higher moments and conditioned moments are not generally
available. We provide explicit formulae for these, describe their behaviors as
drift rates and starting points approach interesting limits, and, with the
support of numerical simulations, discuss how trial-to-trial variability of
drift rates, starting points, and non-decision times affect these behaviors in
the extended diffusion model. Both unconditioned moments and those conditioned
on correct and erroneous responses are treated. We argue that the results will

many genes in a diverse manner. It is widely believed that these alterations
follow combinatorial patterns that have a strong connection with the underlying
molecular interaction networks and functional pathways. A better understanding
of the generative mechanisms behind the mutation rules and their influence on
gene communities is of great importance for the process of driver mutations
discovery and for identification of network modules related to cancer
development and progression. We developed a new method for cancer mutation
pattern analysis based on a constrained form of correlation clustering.
Correlation clustering is an agnostic learning method that can be used for
general community detection problems in which the number of communities or
their structure is not known beforehand. The resulting algorithm, named $C^3$,
leverages mutual exclusivity of mutations, patient coverage, and driver network
concentration principles; it accepts as its input a user determined combination
of heterogeneous patient data, such as that available from TCGA (including
mutation, copy number, and gene expression information), and creates a large
number of clusters containing mutually exclusive mutated genes in a particular
type of cancer. The cluster sizes may be required to obey some useful soft size
constraints, without impacting the computational complexity of the algorithm.
To test $C^3$, we performed a detailed analysis on TCGA breast cancer and
glioblastoma data and showed that our algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art CoMEt method in terms of discovering mutually exclusive gene
modules and identifying driver genes. Our $C^3$ method represents a unique tool
for efficient and reliable identification of mutation patterns and driver
pathways in large-scale cancer genomics studies.

delivery kinetics. The purpose of the current study is to provide a useful
mathematical model for drug release from a drug delivery device and consecutive
drug transport in biological tissue, thereby aiding the development of new

coupled media is presented. Drug release is described by considering
solubilisation dynamics of drug particle, diffusion of the solubilised drug
through porous matrix and also some other processes like reversible
dissociation / recrystallization, drug particle-receptor binding and
internalization phenomena. The model has led to a system of partial
differential equations describing the important properties of drug kinetics.
This model contributes towards the perception of the roles played by diffusion,

method, which allows dissimilarities among graphs up to a predetermined level.
We then formulate the problem as a novel quadratic unconstrained binary

our study is molecular similarity where the presence of noise might be due to
regular errors in measuring molecular features. We develop a similarity measure

mixture comprised of a linear fluid phase and a thrombus (solid) phase. The
transport and reactions of 10 chemical and biological species are incorporated
using a system of coupled convection-reaction-diffusion (CRD) equations to
represent three processes in thrombus formation: initiation, propagation and
stabilization. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations using the
libraries of OpenFOAM were performed for two illustrative benchmark problems:
in vivo thrombus growth in an injured blood vessel and in vitro thrombus
deposition in micro-channels (1.5mm x 1.6mm x 0.1mm) with small crevices
(125{\mu}m x 75{\mu}m and 125{\mu}m x 137{\mu}m). For both problems, the
simulated thrombus deposition agreed very well with experimental observations,
both spatially and temporally. Based on the success with these two benchmark
problems, which have very different flow conditions and biological
environments, we believe that the current model will provide useful insight
into the genesis of thrombosis in blood-wetted devices, and provide a tool for
the design of less thrombogenic devices.

in Neuroscience. This is an ill-posed problem, due to the non-uniqueness of the
solution, and many kinds of prior information have been used to constrain it. A
combination of smoothness (L2 norm-based) and sparseness (L1 norm-based)
constraints is a flexible approach that have been pursued by important examples
such as the Elastic Net (ENET) and mixed-norm (MXN) models. The former is used
to find solutions with a small number of smooth non-zero patches, while the
latter imposes sparseness and smoothness simultaneously along different
dimensions of the spatio-temporal matrix solutions. Both models have been
addressed within the penalized regression approach, where the regularization
parameters are selected heuristically, leading usually to non-optimal
solutions. The existing Bayesian formulation of ENET allows hyperparameter
learning, but using computationally intensive Monte Carlo/Expectation
Maximization methods. In this work we attempt to solve the EEG IP using a
Bayesian framework for models based on mixtures of L1/L2 norms penalization
functions (Laplace/Normal priors) such as ENET and MXN. We propose a Sparse
Bayesian Learning algorithm based on combining the Empirical Bayes and the
iterative coordinate descent procedures to estimate both the parameters and
hyperparameters. Using simple but realistic simulations we found that our
methods are able to recover complicated source setups more accurately and with
a more robust variable selection than the ENET and LASSO solutions using
classical algorithms. We also solve the EEG IP using data coming from a visual
attention experiment, finding more interpretable neurophysiological patterns
with our methods, as compared with other known methods such as LORETA, ENET and
LASSO FUSION using the classical regularization approach.

for this calculation, there are no free-standing, open-source tools designed
for easy tool-chain integration. FreeSASA is an open source C library for SASA
calculations that provides both command-line and Python interfaces in addition
to its C API. The library implements both Lee and Richards' and Shrake and
Rupley's approximations, and is highly configurable to allow the user to
control molecular parameters, accuracy and output granularity. It only depends
on standard C libraries and should therefore be easy to compile and install on
any platform. The source code is freely available from

1601.06780	q-bio	cs.IT math.IT q-bio.OT	"Multivariate information measures: a unification using M\""obius
  operators on subset lattices"	"  Information related measures are useful tools for multi variable data
analysis, as measures of dependence among variables, and as descriptions of
order in biological and physical systems. Information related measures, like
marginal entropies, mutual / interaction / multi-information, have been used in
a number of fields including descriptions of systems complexity and biological
data analysis. The mathematical relationships among these measures are
therefore of significant interest. Relations between common information
measures include the duality relations based on M\""obius inversion on lattices.
These are the direct consequence of the symmetries of the lattices of the sets
of variables (subsets ordered by inclusion). While the mathematical properties
and relationships among these information-related measures are of significant
interest, there has been, to our knowledge, no systematic examination of the
full range of relationships and no unification of this diverse range of
functions into a single formalism as we do here. In this paper we define
operators on functions on these lattices based on the M\""obius inversion idea
that map the functions into one another (M\""obius operators.) We show that
these operators form a simple group isomorphic to the symmetric group S3.
Relations among the set of functions on the lattice are transparently expressed
in terms of the operator algebra, and, applied to the information measures, can
be used to derive a wide range of relationships among measures. We describe a
direct relation between sums of conditional log-likelihoods and previously
defined dependency measures. The algebra is naturally generalized which yields
more extensive relationships. This formalism provides a fundamental unification
of information related measures, but isomorphism of all distributive lattices
with the subset lattice implies broad potential application of these results.

1601.06829	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Stochasticity and the limits to confidence when estimating R_0 of Ebola
  and other emerging infectious diseases"	"  Dynamic models - often deterministic in nature - were used to estimate the
basic reproductive number, R_0, of the 2014-5 Ebola virus disease (EVD)
epidemic outbreak in West Africa. Estimates of R_0 were then used to project
the likelihood for large outbreak sizes, e.g., exceeding hundreds of thousands
of cases. Yet fitting deterministic models can lead to over-confidence in the
confidence intervals of the fitted R_0, and, in turn, the type and scope of
necessary interventions. In this manuscript we propose a hybrid
stochastic-deterministic method to estimate R_0 and associated confidence
intervals (CIs). The core idea is that stochastic realizations of an underlying
deterministic model can be used to evaluate the compatibility of candidate
values of R_0 with observed epidemic curves. The compatibility is based on
comparing the distribution of expected epidemic growth rates with the observed
epidemic growth rate given ""process noise"", i.e., arising due to stochastic
transmission, recovery and death events. By applying our method to reported EVD
case counts from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, we show that prior estimates
of R_0 based on deterministic fits appear to be more confident than analysis of
stochastic trajectories suggests should be possible. Moving forward, we
recommend including a hybrid stochastic-deterministic fitting procedure when
quantifying the full R_0 CI at the onset of an epidemic due to multiple sources
of noise.

  single-molecule FRET using a fast anti-Brownian electrokinetic trap"	"  Observation times of freely diffusing single molecules in solution are
limited by the photophysics of the attached fluorescence markers and by a small
observation volume in the femtolitre range that is required for a sufficient
signal-to-background ratio. To extend diffusion-limited observation times
through a confocal detection volume, A. E. Cohen and W. E. Moerner have
invented and built the ABELtrap - a microfluidic device to actively counteract
Brownian motion of single nanoparticles with an electrokinetic trap. Here we
present a version of an ABELtrap with a laser focus pattern generated by
electro-optical beam deflectors and controlled by a programmable FPGA chip.
This ABELtrap holds single fluorescent nanoparticles for more than 100 seconds,
increasing the observation time of fluorescent nanoparticles compared to free
diffusion by a factor of 10000. To monitor conformational changes of individual
membrane proteins in real time, we record sequential distance changes between
two specifically attached dyes using F\""orster resonance energy transfer
(smFRET). Fusing the a-subunit of the FoF1-ATP synthase with mNeonGreen results
in an improved signal-to-background ratio at lower laser excitation powers.
This increases our measured trap duration of proteoliposomes beyond 2 s.
Additionally, we observe different smFRET levels attributed to varying
distances between the FRET donor (mNeonGreen) and acceptor (Alexa568)
fluorophore attached at the a- and c-subunit of the FoF1-ATP synthase
respectively.

  polymerization"	"  We discuss how information encoded in a template polymer can be
stochastically copied into a copy polymer. We consider four different
stochastic copy protocols of increasing complexity, inspired by building blocks
of the mRNA translation pathway. In the first protocol, monomer incorporation
occurs in a single stochastic transition. We then move to a more elaborate
protocol in which an intermediate step can be used for error correction.
Finally, we discuss the operating regimes of two kinetic proofreading
protocols: one in which proofreading acts from the final copying step, and one
in which it acts from an intermediate step. We review known results for these
models and, in some cases, extend them to analyze all possible combinations of
energetic and kinetic discrimination. We show that, in each of these protocols,
only a limited number of these combinations leads to an improvement of the
overall copying accuracy.

  environments"	"  We study an individual-based model in which two spatially-distributed
species, characterized by different diffusivities, compete for resources. We
consider three different ecological settings. In the first, diffusing faster
has a cost in terms of reproduction rate. In the second case, resources are not
uniformly distributed in space. In the third case, the two species are
transported by a fluid flow. In all these cases, at varying the parameters, we
observe a transition from a regime in which diffusing faster confers an
effective selective advantage to one in which it constitutes a disadvantage. We
analytically estimate the magnitude of this advantage (or disadvantage) and
test it by measuring fixation probabilities in simulations of the
individual-based model. Our results provide a framework to quantify
evolutionary pressure for increased or decreased dispersal in a given
environment.

1601.06962	q-bio	q-bio.QM cs.CY	Towards a Theory for Bio - Cyber Physical Systems Modelling	"  Currently, CyberPhysical Systems (CPS) represents a great challenge for
automatic control and smart systems engineering on both theoretical and
practical levels. Designing CPS requires approaches involving multidisciplinary
competences. However they are designed to be autonomous, the CPS present a part
of uncertainty, which requires interaction with human for engineering,
monitoring, controlling, performing operational maintenance, etc. This
human-CPS interaction led naturally to the human in-the-loop (HITL) concept.
Nevertheless, this HITL concept , which stems from a reductionist point of
view, exhibits limitations due to the different natures of the systems
involved. As opposed to this classical approach, we propose, in this paper, a
model of Bio-CPS (i.e. systems based on an integration of computational
elements within biological systems) grounded on theoretical biology, physics
and computer sciences and based on the key concept of human systems
integration.

According to the literature, this cortex structure can be described by a
clustered network. This way, we construct a clustered network with the same
number of areas as in the cat matrix, where each area is described as a
sub-network with small-world property. We focus on the suppression of neuronal
phase synchronisation considering different kinds of perturbations. Among the
various controlling interventions, we choose three methods: delayed feedback
control, external time-periodic driving, and activation of selected neurons. We
simulate these interventions to provide a procedure to suppress undesired and
pathological abnormal rhythms that can be associated with many forms of
synchronisation. In our simulations, we have verified that the efficiency of
synchronisation suppression by delayed feedback control is higher than external
time-periodic driving and activation of selected neurons for the cat cerebral
cortex with the same coupling strengths.

1601.07019	q-bio	q-bio.QM q-bio.PE	"Fast coalescent-based computation of local branch support from quartet
  frequencies"	"  Species tree reconstruction is complicated by effects of Incomplete Lineage
Sorting (ILS), commonly modeled by the multi-species coalescent model. While
there has been substantial progress in developing methods that estimate a
species tree given a collection of gene trees, less attention has been paid to
fast and accurate methods of quantifying support. In this paper, we propose a
fast algorithm to compute quartet-based support for each branch of a given
species tree with regard to a given set of gene trees. We then show how the
quartet support can be used in the context of the multi-species coalescent
model to compute i) the local posterior probability that the branch is in the
species tree and ii) the length of the branch in coalescent units. We evaluate
the precision and recall of the local posterior probability on a wide set of
simulated and biological data, and show that it has very high precision and
improved recall compared to multi-locus bootstrapping. The estimated branch
lengths are highly accurate when gene trees have little error, but are
underestimated when gene tree estimation error increases. Computation of both
branch length and local posterior probability is implemented as a new feature
in ASTRAL.

1601.07041	q-bio	q-bio.QM	Patterns of mast fruiting - a stochastic approach	"  Mast fruiting represents a synchronous population behaviour which can spread
on large landscape areas. This reproductive pattern is generally perceived as a
synchronous periodic production of large seed crops and has a significant
practical importance to forest natural regeneration in order to synchronize
cuttings. The mechanisms of masting are still argued and models of this
phenomenon are uncommon, so a stochastic approach can cast significant light on
some particular aspects. Trees manage to get synchronized and coordinate their
reproductive routines. But is it possible that trees get synchronized by
chance, absolutely random? Using a Monte Carlo simulation of seeding years and
a theoretical masting pattern, a stochastic analysis is performed in order to
assess the chance of random mast fruiting. Two populations of 100 trees, with
different fruiting periodicity of 2-3 years and 4-6 years, were set and the
fruition dynamic was simulated for 100 years. The results show that periodicity
itself cannot induce by chance the masting effect, but periodicity
mathematically influences the reproductive pattern.

1601.07054	q-bio	physics.data-an q-bio.NC	On causality of extreme events	"  Multiple metrics have been developed to detect causality relations between
data describing the elements constituting complex systems, all of them
considering their evolution through time. Here we propose a metric able to
detect causality within static data sets, by analysing how extreme events in
one element correspond to the appearance of extreme events in a second one. The
metric is able to detect non- linear causalities; to analyse both
cross-sectional and longitudinal data sets; and to discriminate between real
causalities and correlations caused by confounding factors. We validate the
metric through synthetic data, dynamical and chaotic systems, and data
representing the human brain activity in a cognitive task. We further show how
the proposed metric is able to outperform classical causality metrics, provided
non-linear relationships are present and large enough data sets are available.

  intensive farming conditions"	"  Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are contiguous stretches of homozygous genome
which likely reflect transmission from common ances- tors and can be used to
track the inheritance of haplotypes of interest. In the present paper, ROH were
extracted from 50K SNPs and used to detect regions of the genome associated
with susceptibility to diseases in a population of 468 Holstein-Frisian cows.
Diagnosed diseases were categorised as infectious diseases, metabolic
syndromes, mastitis, reproductive diseases and locomotive disorders. ROH
associated with infectious diseases, mastitis and locomotive disorders were
found on BTA 12. A long region of homozygosity linked with metabolic syndromes,
infectious and reproductive diseases was detected on BTA 15, disclosing complex
relationships between immunity, metabolism and functional disorders. ROH
associated with infectious and reproductive diseases, mastitis and metabolic
syndromes were observed on chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 13 and 18. Previous studies
reported QTLs for milk production traits on all of these regions, thus
substantiating the known negative relationship between selection for milk
production and health in dairy cattle.

1601.07063	q-bio	q-bio.QM	A dynamical network model for age-related health deficits and mortality	"  How long people live depends on their health, and how it changes with age.
Individual health can be tracked by the accumulation of age-related health
deficits. The fraction of age-related deficits is a simple quantitative measure
of human aging. This quantitative frailty index (F) is as good as chronological
age in predicting mortality. In this paper, we use a dynamical network model of
deficits to explore the effects of interactions between deficits, deficit
damage and repair processes, and the connection between the F and mortality.
With our model, we qualitatively reproduce Gompertz's law of increasing human
mortality with age, the broadening of the F distribution with age, the
characteristic non-linear increase of the F with age, and the increased
mortality of high-frailty individuals. No explicit time-dependence in damage or
repair rates is needed in our model. Instead, implicit time-dependence arises
through deficit interactions -- so that the average deficit damage rates
increases, and deficit repair rates decreases, with age . We use a simple
mortality criterion, where mortality occurs when the most connected node is
damaged.

1601.07086	q-bio	q-bio.GN cs.IT math.IT math.PR	Sequence assembly from corrupted shotgun reads	"  The prevalent technique for DNA sequencing consists of two main steps:
shotgun sequencing, where many randomly located fragments, called reads, are
extracted from the overall sequence, followed by an assembly algorithm that
aims to reconstruct the original sequence. There are many different
technologies that generate the reads: widely-used second-generation methods
create short reads with low error rates, while emerging third-generation
methods create long reads with high error rates. Both error rates and error
profiles differ among methods, so reconstruction algorithms are often tailored
to specific shotgun sequencing technologies. As these methods change over time,
a fundamental question is whether there exist reconstruction algorithms which
are robust, i.e., which perform well under a wide range of error distributions.
  Here we study this question of sequence assembly from corrupted reads. We
make no assumption on the types of errors in the reads, but only assume a bound
on their magnitude. More precisely, for each read we assume that instead of
receiving the true read with no errors, we receive a corrupted read which has
edit distance at most $\epsilon$ times the length of the read from the true
read. We show that if the reads are long enough and there are sufficiently many
of them, then approximate reconstruction is possible: we construct a simple
algorithm such that for almost all original sequences the output of the
algorithm is a sequence whose edit distance from the original one is at most
$O(\epsilon)$ times the length of the original sequence.

hypotheses that explain the saturation expressed in the fractional cell kill
law that governs the lysis of tumor cells by cytotoxic CD8 + T cells (CTLs). In
order to give insight into the significance of the parameters appearing in such
law, a hybrid cellular automaton model describing the spatio-temporal evolution
of tumor growth and its interaction with the cell-mediated immune response is
used. When the CTLs eradicate efficiently the tumor cells, the model predicts a
correlation between the morphology of the tumors and the rate at which they are
lysed. As the effectiveness of the effector cells is decreased, the saturation
gradually disappears. This limit is thoroughly discussed and a new fractional
cell kill is proposed.

1601.07191	q-bio	q-bio.MN cond-mat.dis-nn physics.bio-ph	Probing the limits to microRNA-mediated control of gene expression	"  According to the `ceRNA hypothesis', microRNAs (miRNAs) may act as mediators
of an effective positive interaction between long coding or non-coding RNA
molecules, carrying significant potential implications for a variety of
biological processes. Here, inspired by recent work providing a quantitative
description of small regulatory elements as information-conveying channels, we
characterize the effectiveness of miRNA-mediated regulation in terms of the
optimal information flow achievable between modulator (transcription factors)
and target nodes (long RNAs). Our findings show that, while a sufficiently
large degree of target derepression is needed to activate miRNA-mediated
transmission, (a) in case of differential mechanisms of complex processing
and/or transcriptional capabilities, regulation by a post-transcriptional
miRNA-channel can outperform that achieved through direct transcriptional
control; moreover, (b) in the presence of large populations of weakly
interacting miRNA molecules the extra noise coming from titration disappears,
allowing the miRNA-channel to process information as effectively as the direct
channel. These observations establish the limits of miRNA-mediated
post-transcriptional cross-talk and suggest that, besides providing a degree of
noise buffering, this type of control may be effectively employed in cells both
as a failsafe mechanism and as a preferential fine tuner of gene expression,
pointing to the specific situations in which each of these functionalities is
maximized.

classic and hemorrhagic dengue continue to be reported presently. Since 2002
(and before), a worrying outbreak of dengue was observed in several states of
Mexico, notably the case of Colima for which a ""descacharrizacion"" campaign was
implemented in 2009 to encourage the population to get rid of old objects
accumulated in their backyards and outdoors so as to prevent proliferation of
mosquitoes Aedes Aegypti. To understand the effect of such campaign, we studied
the incidence of dengue in four municipalities of the mentioned state, namely
Manzanillo, Armeria, Tecoman and Ixtlahuacan. In particular, we observed that
the incidence of dengue in these four municipalities had a strong relationship
with climatological normals, specifically precipitation and minimum
temperature. Furthermore, the results showed that the mentioned campaign helped
prevent mosquito eggs incubation and their development, thus leading to
reduction of the incidence of dengue in the human population.

uncoupling, the lack of electrical, and respectively mechanical,
synchronization in different regions of the stomach. Therefore, non-invasive
detection of the onset of gastric electrical uncoupling can be important for
diagnosing associated gastric motility disorders. The aim of this study is to
provide a wavelet-based analysis of electrogastrograms (EGG, the cutaneous
recordings of gastric electric activity), to detect gastric electric
uncoupling. Eight-channel EGG recordings were acquired from sixteen dogs in
basal state and after each of two circular gastric myotomies. These myotomies
simulated mild and severe gastric electrical uncoupling, while keeping the
separated gastric sections electrophysiologically active by preserving their
blood supply. After visual inspection, manually selected 10-minute EGG segments
were submitted to wavelet analysis. Quantitative methodology to choose an
optimal wavelet was derived. This ""matching"" wavelet was determined using the
Pollen parameterization for 6-tap wavelet filters and error minimization
criteria. After a wavelet-based compression, the distortion of the approximated
EGG signals was computed. Statistical analysis on the distortion values allowed
to significantly ($p<0.05$) distinguish basal state from mild and severe
gastric electrical uncoupling groups in particular EGG channels.

historical growth of the world population in the past 12,000 years and with a
similar but limited study carried out over 50 years ago. This analysis is also
in harmony with the study of the historical economic growth. Within the range
of analysable data, there was no Malthusian stagnation. Takeoffs from
stagnation to growth, postulated by the Unified Growth Theory never happened.
There were no escapes from the Malthusian trap because there was no trap. This
analysis and the earlier studies of the Gross Domestic Product lead to the
conclusion that there were also no takeoffs in the income per capita
distributions, claimed by the Unified Growth Theory. Consequently, the claimed
in this theory differential timing in takeoffs never happened. Unified Growth
Theory is contradicted yet again by the mathematical analysis of the same data,
which were used, but never analysed, during the formulation of this theory.
However, this study, as well as the earlier publications on the related topics,
shows also that some fundamental postulates used in the economic and
demographic research are repeatedly contradicted by the mathematical analysis
of data.

1601.07447	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Bayesian phylogenetic estimation of fossil ages	"  Recent advances have allowed for both morphological fossil evidence and
molecular sequences to be integrated into a single combined inference of
divergence dates under the rule of Bayesian probability. In particular the
fossilized birth-death tree prior and the Lewis-Mk model of discrete
morphological evolution allow for the estimation of both divergence times and
phylogenetic relationships between fossil and extant taxa. We exploit this
statistical framework to investigate the internal consistency of these models
by producing phylogenetic estimates of the age of each fossil in turn, within
two rich and well-characterized data sets of fossil and extant species
(penguins and canids). We find that the estimation accuracy of fossil ages is
generally high with credible intervals seldom excluding the true age and median
relative error in the two data sets of 5.7% and 13.2% respectively. The median
relative standard error (RSD) was 9.2% and 7.2% respectively, suggesting good
precision, although with some outliers. In fact in the two data sets we analyze
the phylogenetic estimates of fossil age is on average < 2 My from the midpoint
age of the geological strata from which it was excavated. The high level of
internal consistency found in our analyses suggests that the Bayesian
statistical model employed is an adequate fit for both the geological and
morphological data, and provides evidence from real data that the framework
used can accurately model the evolution of discrete morphological traits coded
from fossil and extant taxa. We anticipate that this approach will have diverse
applications beyond divergence time dating, including dating fossils that are
temporally unconstrained, testing of the ""morphological clock"", and for
uncovering potential model misspecification and/or data errors when
controversial phylogenetic hypotheses are obtained based on combined divergence
dating analyses.

connectivity from the perspective of complex networks theory. More
specifically, we apply graph theoretical analyses to provide evidence of the
modular structure of the mouse brain and to shed light on its hierarchical
organization. We propose a novel percolation analysis and we apply our approach
to the analysis of a resting-state functional MRI data set from 41 mice. This
approach reveals a robust hierarchical structure of modules persistent across
different subjects. Importantly, we test this approach against a statistical
benchmark (or null model) which constrains only the distributions of empirical
correlations. Our results unambiguously show that the hierarchical character of
the mouse brain modular structure is not trivially encoded into this
lower-order constraint. Finally, we investigate the modular structure of the
mouse brain by computing the Minimal Spanning Forest, a technique that
identifies subnetworks characterized by the strongest internal correlations.
This approach represents a faster alternative to other community detection
methods and provides a means to rank modules on the basis of the strength of
their internal edges.

or ""rate"" model networks have been analyzed and applied extensively for these
purposes. However, neurons fire action potentials, and the discrete nature of
spiking is an important feature of neural circuit dynamics. Despite significant
advances, training recurrently connected spiking neural networks remains a
challenge. We present a procedure for training recurrently connected spiking
networks to generate dynamical patterns autonomously, to produce complex
temporal outputs based on integrating network input, and to model physiological
data. Our procedure makes use of a continuous-variable network to identify
targets for training the inputs to the spiking model neurons. Surprisingly, we
are able to construct spiking networks that duplicate tasks performed by
continuous-variable networks with only a relatively minor expansion in the
number of neurons. Our approach provides a novel view of the significance and
appropriate use of ""firing rate"" models, and it is a useful approach for
building model spiking networks that can be used to address important questions
about representation and computation in neural systems.

Hypertension is a complex disease caused by many reasons including genetic,

show that the network has the small-world but not scale-free property, and
exhibits a modular structure, revealing compact and complex connections among
these genes. By the threshold of integrated centrality larger than 0.71, seven
key hub genes are found: Jun, Rps6kb1, Cycs, Creb3l2, Cdk4, Actg1 and RT1-Da.
These genes should play an important role in hypertension, suggesting that the

spread of communicable diseases. Control and elimination efforts depend on
characterizing these networks in terms of connections and flux rates of
individuals between contact nodes. In some cases, transport can be
parameterized with gravity-type models or approximated by a diffusive random
walk. As a alternative, we have isolated intranational commercial air traffic
as a case study for the utility of non-diffusive, heavy-tailed transport
models. We implemented new stochastic simulations of a prototypical
influenza-like infection, focusing on the dense, highly-connected United States
air travel network. We show that mobility on this network can be described
mainly by a power law, in agreement with previous studies. Remarkably, we find
that the global evolution of an outbreak on this network is accurately
reproduced by a two-parameter space-fractional diffusion equation, such that
those parameters are determined by the air travel network.

1601.07740	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"A computational model describing the interplay of basal ganglia and
  subcortical background oscillations during working memory processes"	"  Working memory is responsible for the temporary manipulation and storage of
information to support reasoning, learning and comprehension in the human
brain. Background oscillations from subcortical structures may drive a gating
or switching mechanism during working memory computations, and different
frequency bands may be associated with different processes while working memory
tasks are performed. There are three well-known relationships between working
memory processes and specific frequency bands of subcortical oscillations,
namely: the storage of new information which correlates positively with
beta/gamma-frequency band oscillations, the maintenance of information while
ignoring irrelevant stimulation which is directly linked to theta-frequency
band oscillations, and the clearance of memory which is associated with
alpha-frequency band oscillations. Although these relationships between working
memory processes and subcortical background oscillations have been observed, a
full explanation of these phenomena is still needed. This paper will aid
understanding of the working memory's operation and phase switching by
proposing a novel and biophysical realistic mathematical-computational
framework which unifies the generation of subcortical background oscillations,
the role of basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits and the influence of
dopamine in the selection of working memory operations and phases: this has
never been attempted before.

1601.07766	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Prediction Errors Drive UCS Revaluation and not Classical Conditioning:
  Evidence and Neurophysiological Consequences"	"  Nowadays, the experimental study of emotional learning is commonly based on
classical conditioning paradigms and models, which have been thoroughly
investigated in the last century. On the contrary, limited attention has been
paid to the revaluation of an unconditioned stimulus (UCS), which, as
experimentally observed by various researchers in the last four decades, occurs
out of classical conditioning. For this reason, no analytical or quantitative
theory has been developed for this phenomenon and its dynamics. Unluckily,
models based on classical conditioning are unable to explain or predict
important psychophysiological phenomena, such as the failure of the extinction
of emotional responses in certain circumstances. In this manuscript an
analytical representation of UCS revaluation learning is developed; this allows
us to identify the conditions determining the ""inextinguishability"" (or
resistant-to-extinction) property of emotional responses and reactions (such as
those observed in evaluative conditioning, in the nonreinforcement presentation
of a conditioned inhibitor, in post-traumatic stress disorders and in panic
attacks). Furthermore, an analysis of the causal relation existing between
classical conditioning and UCS revaluation is provided. Starting from this
result, a theory of implicit emotional learning and a novel interpretation of
classical conditioning are derived. Moreover, we discuss how the proposed
theory can lead to the development of new methodologies for the detection and
the treatment of undesired or pathological emotional responses, and can inspire
animal models for resistant-to-extinction responses and reactions.

1601.07810	q-bio	cs.CE math.NA q-bio.NC	"The Unfitted Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Solving the EEG Forward
  Problem"	"  Objective: The purpose of this study is to introduce and evaluate the
unfitted discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (UDG-FEM) for solving the
electroencephalography (EEG) forward problem. Methods: This new approach for
source analysis does not use a geometry conforming volume triangulation, but
instead uses a structured mesh that does not resolve the geometry. The geometry
is described using level set functions and is incorporated implicitly in its
mathematical formulation. As no triangulation is necessary, the complexity of a
simulation pipeline and the need for manual interaction for patient specific
simulations can be reduced and is comparable with that of the FEM for
hexahedral meshes. In addition, it maintains conservation laws on a discrete
level. Here, we present the theory for UDG-FEM forward modeling, its
verification using quasi-analytical solutions in multi-layer sphere models and
an evaluation in a comparison with a discontinuous Galerkin (DG-FEM) method on
hexahedral and on conforming tetrahedral meshes. We furthermore apply the
UDG-FEM forward approach in a realistic head model simulation study. Results:
The given results show convergence and indicate a good overall accuracy of the
UDG-FEM approach. UDG-FEM performs comparable or even better than DG-FEM on a
conforming tetrahedral mesh while providing a less complex simulation pipeline.
When compared to DG-FEM on hexahedral meshes, an overall better accuracy is
achieved. Conclusion: The UDG-FEM approach is an accurate, flexible and
promising method to solve the EEG forward problem. Significance: This study
shows the first application of the UDG-FEM approach to the EEG forward problem.

  and the Canonical Equation"	"  We propose a faster algorithm for individual based simulations for adaptive
dynamics based on a simple modification to the standard Gillespie Algorithm for
simulating stochastic birth-death processes. We provide an analytical
explanation that shows that simulations based on the modified algorithm, in the
deterministic limit, lead to the same equations of adaptive dynamics as well as
same conditions for evolutionary branching as those obtained from the standard
Gillespie algorithm. Based on this algorithm, we provide an intuitive and
simple interpretation of the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics. With the
help of examples we compare the performance of this algorithm to the standard
Gillespie algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency. We also study an example
using this algorithm to study evolutionary dynamics in a multi-dimensional
phenotypic space and study the question of predictability of evolution.

  corticobasal syndrome"	"  Multimodal neuroimaging studies of corticobasal syndrome using volumetric MRI
and DTI successfully discriminate between Alzheimer's disease and
frontotemporal lobar degeneration but this evidence has typically included
clinically heterogeneous patient cohorts and has rarely assessed the network
structure of these distinct sources of pathology. Using structural MRI data, we
identify areas in fronto-temporo-parietal cortex with reduced gray matter
density in corticobasal syndrome relative to age matched controls. A support
vector machine procedure demonstrates that gray matter density poorly
discriminates between frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease
pathology subgroups with low sensitivity and specificity. In contrast, a
statistic of local network efficiency demonstrates excellent discriminatory
power, with high sensitivity and specificity. Our results indicate that the
underlying pathological sources of corticobasal syndrome can be classified more
accurately using graph theoretical statistics of white matter microstructure in
association cortex than by regional gray matter density alone. These results
highlight the importance of a multimodal neuroimaging approach to diagnostic
analyses of corticobasal syndrome and suggest that distinct sources of
pathology mediate the circuitry of brain regions affected by corticobasal
syndrome.

positively correlated with emotional state. Our results inform the modulation

1601.07970	q-bio	q-bio.PE cond-mat.stat-mech	Comparing reactive and memory-one strategies of direct reciprocity	"  Direct reciprocity is a mechanism for the evolution of cooperation based on
repeated interactions. When individuals meet repeatedly, they can use
conditional strategies to enforce cooperative outcomes that would not be
feasible in one-shot social dilemmas. Direct reciprocity requires that
individuals keep track of their past interactions and find the right response.
However, there are natural bounds on strategic complexity: Humans find it
difficult to remember past interactions accurately, especially over long
timespans. Given these limitations, it is natural to ask how complex strategies
need to be for cooperation to evolve. Here, we study stochastic evolutionary
game dynamics in finite populations to systematically compare the evolutionary
performance of reactive strategies, which only respond to the co-player's
previous move, and memory-one strategies, which take into account the own and
the co-player's previous move. In both cases, we compare deterministic strategy
and stochastic strategy spaces. For reactive strategies and small costs, we
find that stochasticity benefits cooperation, because it allows for
generous-tit-for-tat. For memory one strategies and small costs, we find that
stochasticity does not increase the propensity for cooperation, because the
deterministic rule of win-stay, lose-shift works best. For memory one
strategies and large costs, however, stochasticity can augment cooperation.

  cancer tissue"	"  We introduce a simple, interpretable strategy for making predictions on test
data when the features of the test data are available at the time of model
fitting. Our proposal - customized training - clusters the data to find
training points close to each test point and then fits an $\ell_1$-regularized
model (lasso) separately in each training cluster. This approach combines the
local adaptivity of $k$-nearest neighbors with the interpretability of the
lasso. Although we use the lasso for the model fitting, any supervised learning
method can be applied to the customized training sets. We apply the method to a
mass-spectrometric imaging data set from an ongoing collaboration in gastric
cancer detection which demonstrates the power and interpretability of the
technique. Our idea is simple but potentially useful in situations where the
data have some underlying structure.

  drive shaft"	"  F1F0 ATP synthase (ATPase) either facilitates the synthesis of ATP in the
mitochondrial membranes and bacterial inner membranes in a process driven by
the proton moving force (pmf), or uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to pump
protons against the concentration gradient across the membrane. ATPase is
composed of two rotary motors, F0 and F1, which generate the opposing rotation
and compete for control of their shared central gamma-shaft. Here we present a
self-consistent physical model of the F1 motor as a simplified two-state
Brownian ratchet based on the asymmetry of torsional elastic energy of the
coiled-coil gamma-shaft. This stochastic model unifies the physical description
of linear and rotary motors and explains the stepped unidirectional rotation of
the $\gamma$-shaft, in agreement with the `binding-change' ideas of Boyer.
Substituting the model parameters, all independently known from recent
experiments, our model quantitatively reproduces the ATPase operation, e.g. the
`no-load' angular velocity is ca. 400~rad/s anticlockwise at 4 mM ATP, in close
agreement with experiment. Increasing the pmf torque exerted by F0 can slow,
stop and overcome the torque generated by F1, switching from ATP hydrolysis to
synthesis at a very low value of `stall torque'. We discuss the matters of the
motor efficiency, which is very low if calculated from the useful mechanical
work it produces - but is quite high when the `useful outcome' is measured in
the number of H+ pushed against the chemical gradient in the F1 ATP-driven
operation.

1601.08165	q-bio	stat.ML cs.CV q-bio.NC	Mapping Tractography Across Subjects	"  Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and tractography provide means to
study the anatomical structures within the white matter of the brain. When
studying tractography data across subjects, it is usually necessary to align,
i.e. to register, tractographies together. This registration step is most often
performed by applying the transformation resulting from the registration of
other volumetric images (T1, FA). In contrast with registration methods that
""transform"" tractographies, in this work, we try to find which streamline in
one tractography correspond to which streamline in the other tractography,
without any transformation. In other words, we try to find a ""mapping"" between
the tractographies. We propose a graph-based solution for the tractography
mapping problem and we explain similarities and differences with the related
well-known graph matching problem. Specifically, we define a loss function
based on the pairwise streamline distance and reformulate the mapping problem
as combinatorial optimization of that loss function. We show preliminary
promising results where we compare the proposed method, implemented with
simulated annealing, against a standard registration techniques in a task of
segmentation of the corticospinal tract.

1601.08202	q-bio	q-bio.QM	"Identifying differences in the rules of interaction between individuals
  in moving animal groups"	"  Collective movement can be achieved when individuals respond to the local
movements and positions of their neighbours. Some individuals may
disproportionately influence group movement if they occupy particular spatial
positions in the group, for example, positions at the front of the group. We
asked, therefore, what led individuals in moving pairs of fish (Gambusia
holbrooki) to occupy a position in front of their partner. Individuals adjusted
their speed and direction differently in response to their partner's position,
resulting in individuals occupying different positions in the group.
Individuals that were found most often at the front of the pair had greater
mean changes in speed than their partner, and were less likely to turn towards
their partner, compared to those individuals most often found at the back of
the pair. The pair moved faster when led by the individual that was usually at
the front. Our results highlight how differences in the social responsiveness
between individuals can give rise to leadership in free moving groups. They
also demonstrate how the movement characteristics of groups depend on the
spatial configuration of individuals within them.

1602.00096	q-bio	q-bio.MN	Exploiting synthetic lethal vulnerabilities for cancer therapy	"  Synthetic lethality refers to a combination of two or more genetic events
(typically affecting different genes) in which the co-occurrence of the events
results in cell or organismal lethality, but the cell or organism remains
viable when only one of the events occurs. Synthetic lethality has gained
attention in the last few years for its value in selective killing of cancer
cells: by targeting the synthetic lethal partner of an altered gene in cancer,
only the cancer cells can be killed while sparing normal cells. In a recent
study, we showed that mutual exclusive combinations of genetic events in cancer
hint at naturally occurring synthetic lethal combinations, and therefore by
systematically mining for these combinations we can identify novel therapeutic
targets for cancer. Based on this, we had identified a list of 718 genes that
are mutually exclusive to six DNA-damage response genes in cancer. Here, we
extend these results to identify a subset of 43 genes whose over-expression
correlates with significantly poor survival in estrogen receptor-negative
breast cancers, and thus provide a promising list of potential therapeutic
targets and/or biomarkers.

1602.00236	q-bio	stat.ML q-bio.NC	"Nonlinearities and Adaptation of Color Vision from Sequential Principal
  Curves Analysis"	"  Mechanisms of human color vision are characterized by two phenomenological
aspects: the system is nonlinear and adaptive to changing environments.
Conventional attempts to derive these features from statistics use separate
arguments for each aspect. The few statistical approaches that do consider both
phenomena simultaneously follow parametric formulations based on empirical
models. Therefore, it may be argued that the behavior does not come directly
from the color statistics but from the convenient functional form adopted. In
addition, many times the whole statistical analysis is based on simplified
databases that disregard relevant physical effects in the input signal, as for
instance by assuming flat Lambertian surfaces. Here we address the simultaneous
statistical explanation of (i) the nonlinear behavior of achromatic and
chromatic mechanisms in a fixed adaptation state, and (ii) the change of such
behavior. Both phenomena emerge directly from the samples through a single
data-driven method: the Sequential Principal Curves Analysis (SPCA) with local
metric. SPCA is a new manifold learning technique to derive a set of sensors
adapted to the manifold using different optimality criteria. A new database of
colorimetrically calibrated images of natural objects under these illuminants
was collected. The results obtained by applying SPCA show that the
psychophysical behavior on color discrimination thresholds, discount of the
illuminant and corresponding pairs in asymmetric color matching, emerge
directly from realistic data regularities assuming no a priori functional form.
These results provide stronger evidence for the hypothesis of a statistically
driven organization of color sensors. Moreover, the obtained results suggest
that color perception at this low abstraction level may be guided by an error
minimization strategy rather than by the information maximization principle.

  Neurophysiological Consequences and a Quantitative Model"	"  Despite growing scientific interest in the placebo effect and increasing
understanding of neurobiological mechanisms, theoretical modeling of the
placebo response remains poorly developed. The most extensively accepted
theories are expectation and conditioning, involving both conscious and
unconscious information processing. However, it is not completely understood
how these mechanisms can shape the placebo response. We focus here on neural
processes which can account for key properties of the response to substance
intake. It is shown that placebo response can be conceptualized as a reaction
of a distributed neural system within the central nervous system. Such a
reaction represents an integrated component of the response to open substance
administration (or to substance intake) and is updated through ""unconditioned
stimulus (UCS) revaluation"" learning. The analysis leads to a theorem, which
proves the existence of two distinct quantities coded within the brain, these
are the expected or prediction outcome and the reactive response. We show that
the reactive response is updated automatically by implicit revaluation lerning,
while the expected outcome can also be modulated through conscious information
processing. Conceptualizing the response to substance intake in terms of UCS
revaluation learning leads to the theoretical formulation of a potential
neuropharmacological treatment for increasing unlimitedly the effectiveness of
a given drug.

1602.00282	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Role of epistasis on the fixation probability of a non-mutator in an
  adapted asexual population"	"  The mutation rate of a well adapted population is prone to reduction so as to
have a lower mutational load. We aim to understand the role of epistatic
interactions between the fitness affecting mutations in this process. Using a
multitype branching process, the fixation probability of a single non-mutator
emerging in a large asexual mutator population is analytically calculated here.
The mutator population undergoes deleterious mutations at constant, but at a
much higher rate than that of the non-mutator. We find that antagonistic
epistasis lowers the chances of mutation rate reduction, while synergistic
epistasis enhances it. Below a critical value of epistasis, the fixation
probability behaves non-monotonically with variation in mutation rate of the
background population. Moreover, the variation of this critical value of the
epistasis parameter with the strength of the mutator is discussed in the
Appendix. For synergistic epistasis, when selection is varied, the fixation
probability reduces overall, with damped oscillations.

dynamic behaviour of a moving-boundary model for tubulin-driven axonal growth.
The model is nonlinear and consists of a coupled set of a partial differential
equation (PDE) and two ordinary differential equations. The PDE is defined on a
computational domain with a moving boundary, which is part of the solution.
Numerical simulations based on standard explicit time-stepping methods are too
time consuming due to the small time steps required for numerical stability. On
the other hand standard implicit schemes are too complex due to the nonlinear
equations that needs to be solved in each step. Instead, we propose to use the
Peaceman--Rachford splitting scheme combined with temporal and spatial scalings
of the model. Simulations based on this scheme have shown to be efficient,
accurate, and reliable which makes it possible to evaluate the model, e.g.\ its
dependency on biological and physical model parameters. These evaluations show
among other things that the initial axon growth is very fast, that the active
transport is the dominant reason over diffusion for the growth velocity, and
that the polymerization rate in the growth cone does not affect the final axon
length.

  approach"	"  Based on the glocal HIM metric and its induced graph kernel, we propose a
novel solution in differential network analysis that integrates network
comparison and classification tasks. The HIM distance is defined as the
one-parameter family of product metrics linearly combining the normalised
Hamming distance H and the normalised Ipsen-Mikhailov spectral distance IM. The
combination of the two components within a single metric allows overcoming
their drawbacks and obtaining a measure that is simultaneously global and
local. Furthermore, plugging the HIM kernel into a Support Vector Machine gives
us a classification algorithm based on the HIM distance. First, we outline the
theory underlying the metric construction. We introduce two diverse
applications of the HIM distance and the HIM kernel to biological datasets.
This versatility supports the adoption of the HIM family as a general tool for
information extraction, quantifying difference among diverse in- stances of a
complex system. An Open Source implementation of the HIM metrics is provided by
the R package nettols and in its web interface ReNette.

diffusion and ballistic motion, in which the distribution function of ballistic
motion directions varies from point to point in space. The specific space
dependence of the directional distribution together with the switching rates
between the two modes of motion establishes a spatially inhomogeneous search
strategy. We show that the mean first passage times for several standard search
problems - narrow escape, reaction partner finding, reaction-escape - can be
minimized with a directional distribution that is reminiscent of the spatial
organization of the cytoskeleton filaments of cells with a centrosome: radial
ballistic transport from center to periphery and back, and ballistic transport
in random directions within a concentric shell of thickness $\Delta_{\rm opt}$
along the domain boundary. The results suggest that living cells realize
efficient search strategies for various intracellular transport problems
economically through a spatial cytoskeleton organization that involves radial
microtubules in the central region and only a narrow actin cortex rather than a
cell body filled with randomly oriented actin filaments.

  Principal Orthogonal Decomposition: Evidence for Leptospira in the Ugandan
  Neonatal Septisome"	"  Neonatal sepsis (NS) is responsible for over a 1 million yearly deaths
worldwide. In the developing world NS is often treated without an identified
microbial pathogen. Amplicon sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene can be
used to identify organisms that are difficult to detect by routine
microbiological methods. However, contaminating bacteria are ubiquitous in both
hospital settings and research reagents, and must be accounted for to make
effective use of these data. In the present study, we sequenced the bacterial
16S rRNA gene obtained from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 80 neonates
presenting with NS to the Mbarara Regional Hospital in Uganda. Assuming that
patterns of background contamination would be independent of pathogenic
microorganism DNA, we applied a novel quantitative approach using principal
orthogonal decomposition to separate background contamination from potential
pathogens in sequencing data. We designed our quantitative approach contrasting
blood, CSF, and control specimens, and employed a variety of statistical random
matrix bootstrap hypotheses to estimate statistical significance. These
analyses demonstrate that Leptospira appears present in some infants presenting
within 48 hr of birth, indicative of infection in utero, and up to 28 days of
age, suggesting environmental exposure. This organism cannot be cultured in
routine bacteriological settings, and is enzootic in the cattle that the rural
peoples of western Uganda often live in close proximity. Our findings
demonstrate that statistical approaches to remove background organisms common
in 16S sequence data can reveal putative pathogens in small volume biological
samples from newborns. This computational analysis thus reveals an important
medical finding that has the potential to alter therapy and prevention efforts
in a critically ill population.

  residential mobility"	"  Residential mobility is deeply entangled with all aspects of hunter-gatherer
life ways, and is therefore an issue of central importance in hunter-gatherer
studies. Hunter-gatherers vary widely in annual rates of residential mobility,
and understanding the sources of this variation has long been of interest to
anthropologists and archaeologists. Since mobility is, to a large extent,
driven by the need for a continuous supply of food, a natural framework for
addressing this question is provided by the metabolic theory of ecology. This
provides a powerful framework for formulating formal testable hypotheses
concerning evolutionary and ecological constraints on the scale and variation
of hunter-gatherer residential mobility. We evaluate these predictions using
extant data and show strong support for the hypotheses. We show that the
overall scale of hunter-gatherer residential mobility is predicted by average
human body size, and the limited capacity of mobile hunter-gatherers to store
energy internally. We then show that the majority of variation in residential
mobility observed across cultures is predicted by energy availability in local
ecosystems. Our results demonstrate that large-scale evolutionary and
ecological processes, common to all plants and animals, constrain
hunter-gatherers in predictable ways as they move through territories to
effectively exploit resources over the course of a year. Moreover, our results
extend the scope of the metabolic theory of ecology by showing how it
successfully predicts variation in the behavioral ecology of populations within
a species.

oncogene, neuroblastoma derived) has been a well-documented indicator for poor
prognosis in neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer. Unfortunately, there has been
limited success in understanding MYCN functionality in the landscape of
neuroblastoma and more importantly, given that MYCN has been deemed
undruggable, the need to potentially illuminate key opportunities that
indirectly target MYCN is of great interest. To this end, this work employs an
emerging quantitative technique from network science, namely network curvature,
to quantify the biological robustness of MYCN and its surrounding neighborhood.
In particular, when amplified in Stage IV cancer, MYCN exhibits higher
curvature (more robust) than those samples with under expressed MYCN levels.
When examining the surrounding neighborhood, the above argument still holds for
network curvature, but is lost when only analyzing differential expression - a
common technique amongst oncologists and computational/molecular biologists.
This finding points to the problem (and possible solution) of drug targeting in
the context of complexity and indirect cell signaling affects that have often

1602.00723	q-bio	q-bio.PE	An In Silico Model to Simulate the Evolution of Biological Aging	"  Biological aging is characterized by an age-dependent increase in the
probability of death and by a decrease in the reproductive capacity. Individual
age-dependent rates of survival and reproduction have a strong impact on
population dynamics, and the genetic elements determining survival and
reproduction are under different selective forces throughout an organism
lifespan. Here we develop a highly versatile numerical model of genome
evolution --- both asexual and sexual --- for a population of virtual
individuals with overlapping generations, where the genetic elements affecting
survival and reproduction rate at different life stages are free to evolve due
to mutation and selection. Our model recapitulates several emerging properties
of natural populations, developing longer reproductive lifespan under stable
conditions and shorter survival and reproduction in unstable environments.
Faster aging results as the consequence of the reduced strength of purifying
selection in more unstable populations, which have large portions of the genome
that accumulate detrimental mutations. Unlike sexually reproducing populations
under constant resources, asexually reproducing populations fail to develop an
age-dependent increase in death rates and decrease in reproduction rates,

framework to simulate how populations and genomes change in the context of
biological aging and opens a novel analytical opportunity to characterize how
real populations evolve their specific aging dynamics.

  Circadian System"	"  A wide range of organisms features molecular machines, circadian clocks,
which generate endogenous oscillations with ~24 h periodicity and thereby
synchronize biological processes to diurnal environmental fluctuations.
Recently, it has become clear that plants harbor more complex gene regulatory
circuits within the core circadian clocks than other organisms, inspiring a
fundamental question: are all these regulatory interactions between clock genes
equally crucial for the establishment and maintenance of circadian rhythms? Our
mechanistic simulation for Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrates that at least half
of the total regulatory interactions must be present to express the circadian
molecular profiles observed in wild-type plants. A set of those essential
interactions is called herein a kernel of the circadian system. The kernel
structure unbiasedly reveals four interlocked negative feedback loops
contributing to circadian rhythms, and three feedback loops among them drive
the autonomous oscillation itself. Strikingly, the kernel structure, as well as
the whole clock circuitry, is overwhelmingly composed of inhibitory, rather
than activating, interactions between genes. We found that this tendency
underlies plant circadian molecular profiles which often exhibit
sharply-shaped, cuspidate waveforms. Through the generation of these cuspidate
profiles, inhibitory interactions may facilitate the global coordination of
temporally-distant clock events that are markedly peaked at very specific times
of day. Our systematic approach resulting in experimentally-testable
predictions provides insights into a design principle of biological clockwork,
with implications for synthetic biology.

1602.00808	q-bio	q-bio.NC	The balancing effect in brain-machine interaction	"  The meta analysis of Intangible Brain Machine Interaction (IMMI) data with
random number generators is re-evaluated through the application of rigorous
and recognized mathematical tools. The current analysis shows that the
statistical average of the true RNG-IMMI data is not shifted from chance by
direct mental intervention, thus refuting the IMMI hypothesis. A facet of this
general statistical behavior of true RNG-IMMI data is the statistical balancing
of scores observed in IMMI tests where binary testing conditions are adopted.
The actual dynamics that had been supporting the elusive IMMI effect are shown
to be related to the psychology of experimenters. The implications of the
refutation of the IMMI hypothesis especially on associated phenomena are also
discussed.

gels, and other amorphous aggregates. The final forms include virus capsids and
condensed phases associated with diseases, such as amyloid fibrils. Although
seemingly different, these assemblies all originate from fundamental protein
interactions and are driven by similar thermodynamic and kinetic factors. Here
we review recent advances in understanding protein self-assembly through a soft
condensed matter perspective with an emphasis on three specific systems:
globular proteins, viruses and amyloid fibers. We conclude with a discussion of
unanswered questions in the field.

  Connectivity Analyses"	"  Understanding the human brain remains the Holy Grail in biomedical science,
and arguably in all of the sciences. Our brains represent the most complex
systems in the world (and some contend the universe) comprising nearly one
hundred billion neurons with septillions of possible connections between them.
The structure of these connections engenders an efficient hierarchical system
capable of consciousness, as well as complex thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
Brain connectivity and network analyses have exploded over the last decade due
to their potential in helping us understand both normal and abnormal brain
function. Functional connectivity (FC) analysis examines functional
associations between time series pairs in specified brain voxels or regions.
Brain network analysis serves as a distinct subfield of connectivity analysis
in which associations are quantified for all time series pairs to create an
interconnected representation of the brain (a brain network), which allows
studying its systemic properties. While connectivity analyses underlie network
analyses, the subtle distinction between the two research areas has generally
been overlooked in the literature, with them often being referred to
synonymously. However, developing more useful analytic methods and allowing for
more precise biological interpretations requires distinguishing these two
complementary domains.

  quantum defects in diamond"	"  A key challenge for neuroscience is noninvasive, label-free sensing of action
potential (AP) dynamics in whole organisms with single-neuron resolution. Here,
we present a new approach to this problem: using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) quantum
defects in diamond to measure the time-dependent magnetic fields produced by
single-neuron APs. Our technique has a unique combination of features: (i) it
is noninvasive, as the light that probes the NV sensors stays within the
biocompatible diamond chip and does not enter the organism, enabling activity
monitoring over extended periods; (ii) it is label-free and should be widely
applicable to most organisms; (iii) it provides high spatial and temporal
resolution, allowing precise measurement of the AP waveforms and conduction
velocities of individual neurons; (iv) it directly determines AP propagation
direction through the inherent sensitivity of NVs to the associated AP magnetic
field vector; (v) it is applicable to neurons located within optically opaque
tissue or whole organisms, through which magnetic fields pass largely
unperturbed; and (vi) it is easy-to-use, scalable, and can be integrated with
existing techniques such as wide-field and superresolution imaging. We
demonstrate our method using excised single neurons from two invertebrate
species, marine worm and squid; and then by single-neuron AP magnetic sensing
exterior to whole, live, opaque marine worms for extended periods with no
adverse effect. The results lay the groundwork for real-time, noninvasive 3D
magnetic mapping of functional neuronal networks, ultimately with synapse-scale
(~10 nm) resolution and circuit-scale (~1 cm) field-of-view.

  of Brain Functional Networks"	"  Brain Functional Networks (BFNs), graph theoretical models of brain activity
data, provide a systems perspective of complex functional connectivity within
the brain. Neurological disorders are known to have basis in abnormal
functional activities, that could be captured in terms of network markers.
Schizophrenia is a pathological condition characterized with altered brain
functional state. We created weighted and binary BFN models of schizophrenia
patients as well as healthy subjects starting from fMRI data in an effort to
search for network biomarkers of the disease. We investigated 45 topological
features of BFNs and their higher order combinations (2 to 8). We find that
network features embodying modularity, betweenness, assortativity and edge
density emerge as key markers of schizophrenia. Also, features derived from
weighted BFNs were observed to be more effective in disease classification as
compared to those from binary BFNs. These topological markers may provide
insights into mechanisms of functional activity underlying disease phenotype
and could further be used for designing algorithms for clinical diagnosis of
schizophrenia as well as its early detection.

  features of genomes"	"  Since the sequencing of large genomes, many statistical features of their
sequences have been found. One intriguing feature is that certain subsequences
are much more abundant than others. In fact, abundances of subsequences of a
given length are distributed with a scale-free power-law tail, resembling
properties of human texts, such as the Zipf's law. Despite recent efforts, the
understanding of this phenomenon is still lacking. Here we find that selfish
DNA elements, such as those belonging to the Alu family of repeats, dominate
the power-law tail. Interestingly, for the Alu elements the power-law exponent
increases with the length of the considered subsequences. Motivated by these
observations, we develop a model of selfish DNA expansion. The predictions of
this model qualitatively and quantitatively agree with the empirical
observations. This allows us to estimate parameters for the process of selfish
DNA spreading in a genome during its evolution. The obtained results shed light
on how evolution of selfish DNA elements shapes non-trivial statistical
properties of genomes.

1602.01672	q-bio	q-bio.PE stat.AP	"The Generalised Isolation-With-Migration Model: a Maximum-Likelihood
  Implementation for Multilocus Data Sets"	"  Statistical inference about the speciation process has often been based on
the isolation-with-migration (IM) model, especially when the research aim is to
learn about the presence or absence of gene flow during divergence. The
generalised IM model introduced in this paper extends both the standard
two-population IM model and the isolation-with-initial-migration (IIM) model,
and encompasses both these models as special cases. It can be described as a
two-population IM model in which migration rates and population sizes are
allowed to change at some point in the past. By developing a maximum-likelihood
implementation of this GIM model, we enable inference on both historical and
contemporary rates of gene flow between two closely related species. Our method
relies on the spectral decomposition of the coalescent generator matrix and is
applicable to data sets consisting of the numbers of nucleotide differences
between one pair of DNA sequences at each of a large number of independent
loci.

1602.01743	q-bio	q-bio.QM	Inferring the perturbation time from biological time course data	"  Time course data are often used to study the changes to a biological process
after perturbation. Statistical methods have been developed to determine
whether such a perturbation induces changes over time, e.g. comparing a
perturbed and unperturbed time course dataset to uncover differences. However,
existing methods do not provide a principled statistical approach to identify
the specific time when the two time course datasets first begin to diverge
after a perturbation; we call this the perturbation time. Estimation of the
perturbation time for different variables in a biological process allows us to
identify the sequence of events following a perturbation and therefore provides
valuable insights into likely causal relationships.
  In this paper, we propose a Bayesian method to infer the perturbation time
given time course data from a wild-type and perturbed system. We use a
non-parametric approach based on Gaussian Process regression. We derive a
probabilistic model of noise-corrupted and replicated time course data coming
from the same profile before the perturbation time and diverging after the
perturbation time. The likelihood function can be worked out exactly for this
model and the posterior distribution of the perturbation time is obtained by a
simple histogram approach, without recourse to complex approximate inference
algorithms. We validate the method on simulated data and apply it to study the
transcriptional change occurring in Arabidopsis following inoculation with P.
syringae pv. tomato DC3000 versus the disarmed strain DC3000hrpA.
  An R package, DEtime, implementing the method is available at

1602.01778	q-bio	q-bio.TO physics.bio-ph	Dynamics of Plant Growth; A Theory Based on Riemannian Geometry	"  In this work, a new model for macroscopic plant tissue growth based on
dynamical Riemannian geometry is presented. We treat 1D and 2D tissues as
continuous, deformable, growing geometries for sizes larger than 1mm. The
dynamics of the growing tissue are described by a set of coupled tensor
equations in non-Euclidean (curved) space. These coupled equations represent a
novel feedback mechanism between growth and curvature dynamics.
  For 1D growth, numerical simulations are compared to two measures of root
growth. First, modular growth along the simulated root shows an elongation zone
common to many species of plant roots. Second, the relative elemental growth
rate (REGR) calculated in silico exhibits temporal dynamics recently
characterized in high-resolution root growth studies but which thus far lack a
biological hypothesis to explain them. Namely, the REGR can evolve from a
single peak localized near the root tip to a double-peak structure. In our
model, this is a direct consequence of considering growth as both a geometric
reaction-diffusion process and expansion due to a distributed source of new
materials.
  In 2D, we study a circularly symmetric growing disk with emergent negative
curvatures. These results are compared against thin disk experiments, which are
a proxy model for plant leaves. These results also apply to the curvature
evolution and the inhomogeneous growth pattern of the Acetabularia cap. Lastly,
we extend the model to anisotropic disks and predict the growth dynamics for a
2D curved surface which develops an elongated shape with localized ruffling.
  Our model also provides several measures of the dynamics of tissue growth.
These include the time evolution of the metric and velocity field, which are
dynamical variables in the model, as well as expansion, shear and rotation
which are deformation tensors characterizing the growth of the tissue.

1602.01815	q-bio	q-bio.NC physics.data-an stat.OT	"Exploiting plume structure to decode gas source distance using
  metal-oxide gas sensors"	"  Estimating the distance of a gas source is important in many applications of
chemical sensing, like e.g. environmental monitoring, or chemically-guided
robot navigation. If an estimation of the gas concentration at the source is
available, source proximity can be estimated from the time-averaged gas
concentration at the sensing site. However, in turbulent environments, where
fast concentration fluctuations dominate, comparably long measurements are
required to obtain a reliable estimate. A lesser known feature that can be
exploited for distance estimation in a turbulent environment lies in the
relationship between source proximity and the temporal variance of the local
gas concentration - the farther the source, the more intermittent are gas
encounters. However, exploiting this feature requires measurement of changes in
gas concentration on a comparably fast time scale, that have up to now only
been achieved using photo-ionisation detectors. Here, we demonstrate that by
appropriate signal processing, off-the-shelf metal-oxide sensors are capable of
extracting rapidly fluctuating features of gas plumes that strongly correlate
with source distance. We show that with a straightforward analysis method it is
possible to decode events of large, consistent changes in the measured signal,
so-called 'bouts'. The frequency of these bouts predicts the distance of a gas
source in wind-tunnel experiments with good accuracy. In addition, we found
that the variance of bout counts indicates cross-wind offset to the centreline
of the gas plume. Our results offer an alternative approach to estimating gas
source proximity that is largely independent of gas concentration, using
off-the-shelf metal-oxide sensors. The analysis method we employ demands very
few computational resources and is suitable for low-power microcontrollers.

1602.01848	q-bio	q-bio.QM	Stochastic modeling of cell growth with symmetric or asymmetric division	"  We consider a class of biologically-motivated stochastic processes in which a
unicellular organism divides its resources (volume or damaged proteins, in
particular) symmetrically or asymmetrically between its progeny. Assuming the
final amount of the resource is controlled by a growth policy and subject to
additive and multiplicative noise, we derive the ""master equation"" describing
how the resource distribution evolves over subsequent generations and use it to
study the properties of stable resource distributions. We find conditions under
which a unique stable resource distribution exists and calculate its moments
for the class of affine linear growth policies. Moreover, we apply an
asymptotic analysis to elucidate the conditions under which the stable
distribution (when it exists) has a power-law tail. Finally, we use the results
of this asymptotic analysis along with the moment equations to draw a stability
phase diagram for the system that reveals the counterintuitive result that
asymmetry serves to increase stability while at the same time widening the
stable distribution. We also briefly discuss how cells can divide damaged
proteins asymmetrically between their progeny as a form of damage control. In
the appendix, motivated by the asymmetric division of cell volume in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we extend our results to the case wherein mother and
daughter cells follow different growth policies.

1602.01872	q-bio	math.AP q-bio.QM	Photoacoustic imaging taking into account thermodynamic attenuation	"  In this paper we consider a mathematical model for photoacoustic imaging
which takes into account attenuation due to thermodynamic dissipation. The
propagation of acoustic (compressional) waves is governed by a scalar wave
equation coupled to the heat equation for the excess temperature. We seek to
recover the initial acoustic profile from knowledge of acoustic measurements at
the boundary.
  We recognize that this inverse problem is a special case of boundary
observability for a thermoelastic system. This leads to the use of
control/observability tools to prove the unique and stable recovery of the
initial acoustic profile in the weak thermoelastic coupling regime. This
approach is constructive, yielding a solvable equation for the unknown acoustic
profile. Moreover, the solution to this reconstruction equation can be
approximated numerically using the conjugate gradient method. If certain
geometrical conditions for the wave speed are satisfied, this approach is
well--suited for variable media and for measurements on a subset of the
boundary. We also present a numerical implementation of the proposed
reconstruction algorithm.

understanding of its structure or how it is developed, which is both a strength
and a weakness. In this chapter, we discuss some common misinterpretations of
the ontology and the annotations. A better understanding of the pitfalls and
the biases in the GO should help users make the most of this very rich

commonly made about GO, including the effect of data incompleteness, the

managed. Although bare-metal stents can be traced back to 1994, long term
efficacy of these stents has been shattered by ISR (In-Stent restenosis) and
late stent thrombosis. Research on finding a solution to these issues has led
to the development of DESs (Drug eluting stents). However long term
effectiveness of DESs and various drug delivery systems have raised concerns.
Also current DESs does not have the capability to adjust the drug dose or
release kinetics that corresponds to the diseased status of the affected
vessel. Through the use of a drug delivery system which employs controlled drug
release, it may be possible to control the release rate of the pharmacological
drugs or substances of interest, and therefore one might be able to circumvent
the range of events that leads to ISR, thus preventing the need for further
invasive interventions. To overcome the limitations of drug delivery systems,
the administration of drugs using nanoparticle based microcapsules as carriers
is being researched for their ability to facilitate a sustained, prolonged and
controlled release of drugs. But still much research is needed to evaluate and
fix issues relating toxicity, chemical and mechanical properties of the
nanoparticles. This project combines a range of nanobiotechnological techniques
to synthesise nano-components which are finally assembled together to get the
microcapsules which could be used in drug delivery systems. The microcapsules

  a Spatial Point Process Mixture Model"	"  Cataloging the neuronal cell types that comprise circuitry of individual
brain regions is a major goal of modern neuroscience and the BRAIN initiative.
Single-cell RNA sequencing can now be used to measure the gene expression
profiles of individual neurons and to categorize neurons based on their gene
expression profiles. While the single-cell techniques are extremely powerful
and hold great promise, they are currently still labor intensive, have a high
cost per cell, and, most importantly, do not provide information on spatial
distribution of cell types in specific regions of the brain. We propose a
complementary approach that uses computational methods to infer the cell types
and their gene expression profiles through analysis of brain-wide single-cell
resolution in situ hybridization (ISH) imagery contained in the Allen Brain
Atlas (ABA). We measure the spatial distribution of neurons labeled in the ISH
image for each gene and model it as a spatial point process mixture, whose
mixture weights are given by the cell types which express that gene. By fitting
a point process mixture model jointly to the ISH images, we infer both the
spatial point process distribution for each cell type and their gene expression
profile. We validate our predictions of cell type-specific gene expression
profiles using single cell RNA sequencing data, recently published for the
mouse somatosensory cortex. Jointly with the gene expression profiles, cell
features such as cell size, orientation, intensity and local density level are
inferred per cell type.

therapeutic technique, developed over 100 years, and today over 50% of cancer
patients will undergo traditional X-ray radiotherapy. However, ionizing
radiation therapy is not the only option, as the high-energy photons delivering
their cell-killing radiation energy into cancerous tumor can lead to
significant damage to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor, located throughout
the beam's path. Therefore, in nowadays, advances in ionizing radiation therapy
are competitive to non-ionizing ones, as for example the laser light based
therapy, resulting in a synergism that has revolutionized medicine. The use of
non-invasive or minimally invasive (e.g. through flexible endoscopes)
therapeutic procedures in the management of patients represents a very
interesting treatment option. Moreover, as the major breakthrough in cancer
management is the individualized patient treatment, new biophotonic techniques,
e.g. photo-activated drug carriers, help the improvement of treatment efficacy
and/or normal tissue toxicity. Additionally, recent studies support that laser
technology progresses could revolutionize cancer proton therapy, by reducing
the cost of the needed installations. The aim of this review is to present some

the relevant advances in the ionizing and non-ionizing radiation therapy, i.e.
protons and heavy ions therapy, as well as photodynamic targeted and molecular

tensor imaging (DTI) data in its native subject space rather than in some space
common to the entire study cohort. Despite performing tractography on a
population average in a normalized space, the latter is considered less
favorably at the \emph{individual} subject level because it requires spatial
transformations of DTI data that involve non-linear warping and reorientation
of the tensors. Although the commonly used reorientation strategies such as
finite strain and preservation of principle direction are expected to result in
adequate accuracy for voxel based analyses of DTI measures such as fractional
anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), the reorientations are not always exact
except in the case of rigid transformations. Small imperfections in
reorientation at individual voxel level accumulate and could potentially affect
the tractography results adversely. This study aims to evaluate and compare
deterministic white matter fiber tracking in non-linearly warped DTI against
that in native DTI. The data present promising evidence that tractography in
non-linear warped DTI data could indeed be a viable and valid option for
various statistical analysis of DTI data in a spatially normalized space.

that enables the familial identification of progeny of individual cells in
vivo. Most existing approaches rely on ex vivo viral transduction of cells with
barcodes, followed by adoptive transfer into an animal, which works well for
some systems, but precludes barcoding cells in their native environment, such
as those inside solid tissues. With a view to overcoming this limitation, we
propose a new design for a genetic barcoding construct based on the Cre Lox
system that induces randomly created stable barcodes in cells in situ by
exploiting inherent sequence distance constraints during site-specific
recombination. Leveraging this previously unused feature, we identify the
cassette with maximal code diversity. This proves to be orders of magnitude
higher than what is attainable with previously considered Cre Lox barcoding
approaches and is well suited for its intended applications as it exceeds the
number of lymphocytes or hematopoietic progenitor cells in mice. Moreover, it
can be built using established technology.

tethered to a substrate by a macromolecule --- is a system that has proven
extremely useful for its ability to reveal physical features of the tether,
because the thermal motion of the bound particle reports sensitively on
parameters like the length, the rigidity, or the folding state of its tether.
In this paper, we discuss a novel application of TPM, surveying its utility in
probing the kinetics of single secondary bonds: bonds that form and break
between the tethered particle and a substrate due, for instance, to
receptor/ligand pairs on particle and substrate. Much like the tether itself
affects the motion pattern, so do the presence and absence of such secondary
connections. Keeping the tether properties constant, we demonstrate how raw
positional TPM data may be parsed to generate detailed insights into the
association and dissociation kinetics of single secondary bonds. We do this
using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, specifically developed to
treat the motion of particles close to interfaces.

behaviour, in which the unbinding rate of a single dynein decreases with
increasing force, for a certain range of force. Motivated by these experiments,
we propose a model for catch bonding in dynein using a threshold force bond
deformation (TFBD) model wherein catch bonding sets in beyond a critical
applied load force. We study the effect of catch bonding on unidirectional
transport properties of cellular cargo carried by multiple dynein motors within
the framework of this model. We find catch bonding can result in dramatic
changes in the transport properties, which are in sharp contrast to kinesin
driven unidirectional transport, where catch bonding is absent. We predict
that, under certain conditions, the average velocity of the cellular cargo can
actually increase as applied load is increased. We characterize the transport
properties in terms of a velocity profile phase plot in the parameter space of
the catch bond strength and the stall force of the motor. This phase plot
yields predictions that may be experimentally accessed by suitable
modifications of motor transport and binding properties. Our work necessitates
a reexamination of existing theories of collective bidirectional transport of
cellular cargo where the catch bond effect of dynein described in this paper is
expected to play a crucial role.

CT-Data. The aim is to improve therapy planning for minimal invasive treatment
of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Due to precise measurement of the
abdominal aortic aneurysm and exact simulation of the bifurcated stent graft,
physicians are supported in choosing a suitable stent prior to an intervention.
The presented method can be used to measure the dimensions of the abdominal
aortic aneurysm as well as simulate a bifurcated stent graft. Both of these
procedures are based on a preceding segmentation and skeletonization of the
aortic, right and left iliac. Using these centerlines (aortic, right and left
iliac) a bifurcated initial stent is constructed. Through the implementation of
an ACM method the initial stent is fit iteratively to the vessel walls - due to
the influence of external forces (distance- as well as balloonforce). Following
the fitting process, the crucial values for choosing a bifurcated stent graft
are measured, e.g. aortic diameter, right and left common iliac diameter,
minimum diameter of distal neck. The selected stent is then simulated to the
CT-Data - starting with the initial stent. It hereby becomes apparent if the
dimensions of the bifurcated stent graft are exact, i.e. the fitting to the
arteries was done properly and no ostium was covered.

  therapeutic evaluation of Traditional Herbal Medicines"	"  Traditional Indian (Ayurvedic) and Chinese herbal medicines have been used in
the treatment of a variety of diseases for thousands of years because of their
natural origin and lesser side effects. However, the safety and efficacy data
(including dose and quality parameters) on most of these traditional medicines
are far from sufficient to meet the criteria needed to support their world-wide
therapeutic use. Also, the mechanistic understanding of most of these herbal
medicines is still lacking due to their complex components which further limits
their wider application and acceptance. Metabolomics -a novel approach to
reveal altered metabolism (biochemical effects) produced in response to a
disease or its therapeutic intervention- has huge potential to assess the
pharmacology and toxicology of traditional herbal medicines (THMs). Therefore,
it is gradually becoming a mutually complementary technique to genomics,
transcriptomics and proteomics for therapeutic evaluation of pharmaceutical
products (including THMs); the approach is so called pharmaco-metabolomics. The
whole paradigm is based on its ability to provide metabolic signatures to
confirm the diseased condition and then to use the concentration profiles of
these biomarkers to assess the therapeutic response. Nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy coupled with multivariate data analysis is currently the
method of choice for pharmaco-metabolomics studies owing to its unbiased,

1602.02569	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Pollinator foraging flexibility and coexistence of competing plants	"  We use the optimal foraging theory to study coexistence between two plant
species and a generalist pollinator. We compare conditions for plant
coexistence for non-adaptive vs. adaptive pollinators that adjust their
foraging strategy to maximize fitness. When pollinators have fixed preferences,
we show that plant coexistence typically requires both weak competition between
plants for resources (e.g., space or nutrients) and pollinator preferences that
are not too biased in favour of either plant. We also show how plant
coexistence is promoted by indirect facilitation via the pollinator. When
pollinators are adaptive foragers, pollinator's diet maximizes pollinator's
fitness measured as the per capita population growth rate. Simulations show
that this has two conflicting consequences for plant coexistence. On the one
hand, when competition between pollinators is weak, adaptation favours
pollinator specialization on the more profitable plant which increases
asymmetries in plant competition and makes their coexistence less likely. On
the other hand, when competition between pollinators is strong, adaptation
promotes generalism, which facilitates plant coexistence. In addition, adaptive
foraging allows pollinators to survive sudden loss of the preferred plant host,
thus preventing further collapse of the entire community.

  Opposing Reactions"	"  Models invoking the chemical master equation are used in many areas of
science, and, hence, their simulation is of interest to many researchers. The
complexity of the problems at hand often requires considerable computational
power, so a large number of algorithms have been developed to speed up
simulations. However, a drawback of many of these algorithms is that their
implementation is more complicated than, for instance, the Gillespie algorithm,
which is widely used to simulate the chemical master equation, and can be
implemented with a few lines of code. Here, we present an algorithm which does
not modify the way in which the master equation is solved, but instead modifies
the transition rates, and can thus be implemented with a few lines of code. It
works for all models in which reversible reactions occur by replacing such
reversible reactions with effective net reactions. Examples of such systems
include reaction-diffusion systems, in which diffusion is modelled by a random
walk. The random movement of particles between neighbouring sites is then
replaced with a net random flux. Furthermore, as we modify the transition rates
of the model, rather than its implementation on a computer, our method can be
combined with existing algorithms that were designed to speed up simulations of
the stochastic master equation. By focusing on some specific models, we show
how our algorithm can significantly speed up model simulations while
maintaining essential features of the original model.

1602.02792	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Autocratic strategies for alternating games	"  Repeated games have a long tradition in the behavioral sciences and
evolutionary biology. Recently, strategies were discovered that permit an
unprecedented level of control over repeated interactions by enabling a player
to unilaterally enforce linear constraints on payoffs. Here, we extend this
theory of ""zero-determinant"" (or, more generally, ""autocratic"") strategies to
alternating games, which are often biologically more relevant than traditional
synchronous games. Alternating games naturally result in asymmetries between
players because the first move matters or because players might not move with
equal probabilities. In a strictly-alternating game with two players, $X$ and
$Y$, we give conditions for the existence of autocratic strategies for player
$X$ when (i) $X$ moves first and (ii) $Y$ moves first. Furthermore, we show
that autocratic strategies exist even for (iii) games with randomly-alternating
moves. Particularly important categories of autocratic strategies are
extortionate and generous strategies, which enforce unfavorable and favorable
outcomes for the opponent, respectively. We illustrate these strategies using
the continuous Donation Game, in which a player pays a cost to provide a
benefit to the opponent according to a continuous cooperative investment level.
Asymmetries due to alternating moves could easily arise from dominance
hierarchies, and we show that they can endow subordinate players with more
autocratic strategies than dominant players.

1602.02841	q-bio	q-bio.PE cs.DS math.CO	Combinatorial Scoring of Phylogenetic Networks	"  Construction of phylogenetic trees and networks for extant species from their
characters represents one of the key problems in phylogenomics. While solution
to this problem is not always uniquely defined and there exist multiple methods
for tree/network construction, it becomes important to measure how well the
constructed networks capture the given character relationship across the
species.
  In the current study, we propose a novel method for measuring the specificity
of a given phylogenetic network in terms of the total number of distributions
of character states at the leaves that the network may impose. While for binary
phylogenetic trees, this number has an exact formula and depends only on the
number of leaves and character states but not on the tree topology, the
situation is much more complicated for non-binary trees or networks.
Nevertheless, we develop an algorithm for combinatorial enumeration of such
distributions, which is applicable for arbitrary trees and networks under some
reasonable assumptions.

approach. Beta regression is employed to model the transmission pattern from
parents to their offsprings at the population level. To facilitate this goal,
an expectation maximization algorithm for parameter estimation along with a BIC
criterion to determine the number of clusters is proposed. Applying our method
to the DNA methylation data composed of 4063 CpG sites of 41
mother-father-infant triads, we identified a set of CpG sites in which DNA
methylation transmission is dominated by fathers, while at a large number of
CpG sites, DNA methylation is mainly maternally transmitted to the offspring.

blood samples, we propose a novel classification algorithm called ""Radial
Distance Weighted Discrimination"" (or Radial DWD). This classifier is designed
for binary classification, assuming one class is surrounded by the other class
in very diverse radial directions, which is seen to be typical for our virus
detection data. This separation of the 2 classes in multiple radial directions
naturally motivates the development of Radial DWD. While classical machine
learning methods such as the Support Vector Machine and linear Distance
Weighted Discrimination can sometimes give reasonable answers for a given data
set, their generalizability is severely compromised because of the linear
separating boundary. Radial DWD addresses this challenge by using a more
appropriate (in this particular case) spherical separating boundary.
Simulations show that for appropriate radial contexts, this gives much better
generalizability than linear methods, and also much better than conventional
kernel based (nonlinear) Support Vector Machines, because the latter methods
essentially use much of the information in the data for determining the shape
of the separating boundary. The effectiveness of Radial DWD is demonstrated for
real virus detection.

concentrations. It is unclear how the numerous odorant molecules and their
possible mixtures are discriminated by relatively few olfactory receptors.
Using an information-theoretic model, we show that a receptor array is optimal
for this task if it achieves two possibly conflicting goals: (i) each receptor
should respond to half of all odors and (ii) the response of different
receptors should be uncorrelated when averaged over odors presented with
natural statistics. We use these design principles to predict statistics of the
affinities between receptors and odorant molecules for a broad class of odor
statistics. We also show that optimal receptor arrays can be tuned to either
resolve concentrations well or distinguish mixtures reliably. Finally, we use
our results to predict properties of experimentally measured receptor arrays.
Our work can thus be used to better understand natural olfaction and it also
suggests ways to improve artificial sensor arrays.

for membrane detachment and for the value of adhesion energy. We show that
these quantities exhibit a significant dependence on the active acto-myosin

extend the model to incorporate fluctuations and show that detailed information
on the stability of membrane-cortex coupling can be obtained by a combination
of micropipette aspiration and fluctuation spectroscopy measurements.

The HTS data is expected to surpass those of other ""big data"" domains such as
astronomy, before the year 2025. In addition to sequencing genomes for research
purposes, genome and exome sequencing in clinical settings will be a routine
part of health care. The analysis of such large amounts of data, however, is
not without computational challenges. This burden is even more increased due to
the periodic updates to reference genomes, which typically require re-analysis
of existing data. Here we propose Coin-Application Mediator Interface (Coinami)
to distribute the workload for mapping reads to reference genomes using a
volunteer grid computer approach similar to Berkeley Open Infrastructure for
Network Computing (BOINC). However, since HTS read mapping requires substantial
computational resources and fast analysis turnout is desired, Coinami uses the
HTS read mapping as proof-of-work to generate valid blocks to main its own
cryptocurrency system, which may help motivate volunteers to dedicate more

performed by volunteers are correct, and provides genomic data privacy. The

1602.03093	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"The effect of environmental stochasticity on species richness in neutral
  communities"	"  Environmental stochasticity is known to be a destabilizing factor, increasing
abundance fluctuations and extinction rates of populations. However, the
stability of a community may benefit from the differential response of species
to environmental variations due to the storage effect. This paper provides a
systematic and comprehensive discussion of these two contradicting tendencies,
using the metacommunity version of the recently proposed time-average neutral
model of biodiversity which incorporates environmental stochasticity and
demographic noise and allows for extinction and speciation. We show that the
incorporation of demographic noise into the model is essential to its
applicability, yielding realistic behavior of the system when fitness
variations are relatively weak. The dependence of species richness on the
strength of environmental stochasticity changes sign when the correlation time
of the environmental variations increases. This transition marks the point at
which the storage effect no longer succeeds in stabilizing the community.

damage caused by an infectious disease. However, in many cases, available
resources are insufficient to vaccinate the entire at-risk population,
logistics result in delayed vaccine deployment, and the interaction between
members of different cities facilitates a wide spatial spread of infection.
Limited vaccine, time delays, and interaction (or coupling) of cities lead to
tradeoffs that impact the overall magnitude of the epidemic. These tradeoffs
mandate investigation of optimal strategies that minimize the severity of the
epidemic by prioritizing allocation of vaccine to specific subpopulations. We
use an SIR model to describe the disease dynamics of an epidemic which breaks
out in one city and spreads to another. We solve a master equation to determine
the resulting probability distribution of the final epidemic size. We then
identify tradeoffs between vaccine, time delay, and coupling, and we determine
the optimal vaccination protocols resulting from these tradeoffs.

the growth of new tumors. Driven by a goal to understand this aspect of cancer
proliferation, I develop a discrete computationally optimized mathematical
model of angiogenesis that specializes in intercellular interactions. I model
vascular endothelial growth factor spread and dynamics of endothelial cell
movement in a competitive environment, with parameters specific to our model
calculated through Dependent Variable Sensitivity Analysis (DVSA) and
experimentally observed data. Through simulation testing, we find the critical
limits of angiogenesis to be 102 m and 153 m respectively, beyond which
angiogenesis will not successfully occur. Cell density in the surrounding
region and the concentration of extracellular matrix fibers are also found to
directly inhibit angiogenesis. Through these three factors, we postulate a
method for establishing criticality of a tumor based upon the likelihood of
angiogenesis completing. This research expands on other work by choosing
factors that are patient-dependent through our specialized Cellular Potts mode,
which serves to optimize and increase accuracy of the model. By doing such, I
establish a theoretical framework for analyzing lesions using angiogenetic
properties, with the ability to potentially compute the criticality of tumors
with the aid of medical imaging technology.

  giant monocots"	"  Leaves are the organs that intercept light and create photosynthesis.
Efficient light interception is provided by leaves oriented orthogonal to most
of the sun rays. Except in the polar regions, this means orthogonal to the
direction of acceleration due to gravity, or simply horizontal. The leaves of
almost all terrestrial plants grow in a gravity field that tends to bend them
downward and therefore may counteract light interception. Plants thus allocate
biomass for self-support in order to maintain their leaves horizontal. To
compete with other species (inter-species competition), as well as other
individuals within the same species (intra-species competition), self-support
must be achieved with the least biomass produced. This study examines to what
extent leaves are designed to self-support. We show here that a basic
mechanical model provides the optimal dimensions of a leaf for light
interception and self-support. These results are compared to measurements made
on leaves of various giant monocot species,especially palm trees and banana
trees. The comparison between experiments and model predictions shows that the
longer palms are optimally designed for self-support whereas shorter leaves are
shaped predominantly by other parameters of selection.

the functioning of nervous systems of animals. Obtaining the spikes from
different neurons has been a challenging problem for decades. Several schemes
have been proposed for spike sorting to isolate the spikes of individual
neurons from electrical recordings in extracellular media. However, there is
much scope for improvement in the accuracies obtained using the prevailing
methods of spike sorting. To determine more effective spike sorting strategies
using well known methods, we compared different types of signal features and
techniques for dimensionality reduction in feature space. We tried to determine
an optimum or near optimum feature extraction and dimensionality reduction
methods and an optimum or near optimum number of features for spike sorting. We
assessed relative performance of well known methods on simulated recordings
specially designed for development and benchmarking of spike sorting schemes,
with varying number of spike classes and the well established method of
$k$-means clustering of selected features. We found that almost all well known
methods performed quite well. Nevertheless, from spike waveforms of 64 samples,
sampled at 24 kHz, using principal component analysis (PCA) to select around 46
to 55 features led to the better spike sorting performance than most other
methods (Wilcoxon signed rank sum test, $p < 0.001$).

1602.03493	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Winning versus losing during gambling and its neural correlates	"  Humans often make decisions which maximize an internal utility function. For
example, humans often maximize their expected reward when gambling and this is
considered as a ""rational"" decision. However, humans tend to change their
betting strategies depending on how they ""feel"". If someone has experienced a
losing streak, they may ""feel"" that they are more likely to win on the next
hand even though the odds of the game have not changed. That is, their
decisions are driven by their emotional state. In this paper, we investigate
how the human brain responds to wins and losses during gambling. Using a
combination of local field potential recordings in human subjects performing a
financial decision-making task, spectral analyses, and non-parametric cluster
statistics, we investigated whether neural responses in different cognitive and
limbic brain areas differ between wins and losses after decisions are made. In
eleven subjects, the neural activity modulated significantly between win and
loss trials in one brain region: the anterior insula ($p=0.01$). In particular,
gamma activity (30-70 Hz) increased in the anterior insula when subjects just
realized that they won. Modulation of metabolic activity in the anterior insula
has been observed previously in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies
during decision making and when emotions are elicited. However, our study is
able to characterize temporal dynamics of electrical activity in this brain
region at the millisecond resolution while decisions are made and after
outcomes are revealed.

detachment of the membrane from the cortex of a cell. Based on a simple model
of elastic linkers with force-dependent kinetics, we show that bleb nucleation
is governed by membrane peeling. By this mechanism, the growth or shrinkage of
a detached membrane patch is completely determined by the linker kinetics,
regardless of the energetic cost of the detachment. We predict the critical
nucleation radius for membrane peeling and the corresponding effective energy
barrier. These may be typically smaller than those predicted by classical
nucleation theory, implying a much faster nucleation. We also perform
simulations of a continuum stochastic model of membrane-cortex adhesion to
obtain the statistics of bleb nucleation times as a function of the stress on
the membrane. The determinant role of membrane peeling changes our
understanding of bleb nucleation and opens new directions in the study of
blebs.

communities are often determined by the outcome of social conflicts between
cooperative and selfish individuals (cheaters). Cheaters avoid the cost of
contributing to the community and can occasionally spread in the population
leading to the complete collapse of cooperation. Although such a collapse often
unfolds unexpectedly bearing the traits of a critical transition, it is unclear
whether one can detect the rising risk of cheater's invasions and loss of
cooperation in an evolving community. Here, we combine dynamical networks and
evolutionary game theory to study the abrupt loss of cooperation as a critical
transition. We estimate the risk of collapse of cooperation after the
introduction of a single cheater under gradually changing conditions. We
observe a systematic increase in the average time it takes for cheaters to be
eliminated from the community as the risk of collapse increases. We detect this
risk based on changes in community structure and composition. Nonetheless,
reliable detection depends on the mechanism that governs how cheaters evolve in
the community. Our results suggest possible avenues for detecting the loss of
cooperation in evolving communities

1602.03764	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Theoretical connections between mathematical neuronal models
  corresponding to different expressions of noise"	"  Identifying the right tools to express the stochastic aspects of neural
activity has proven to be one of the biggest challenges in computational
neuroscience. Even if there is no definitive answer to this issue, the most
common procedure to express this randomness is the use of stochastic models. In
accordance with the origin of variability, the sources of randomness are
classified as intrinsic or extrinsic and give rise to distinct mathematical
frameworks to track down the dynamics of the cell. While the external
variability is generally treated by the use of a Wiener process in models such
as the Integrate-and-Fire model, the internal variability is mostly expressed
via a random firing process. In this paper, we investigate how those distinct
expressions of variability can be related. To do so, we examine the probability
density functions to the corresponding stochastic models and investigate in
what way they can be mapped one to another via integral transforms. Our
theoretical findings offer a new insight view into the particular categories of
variability and it confirms that, despite their contrasting nature, the
mathematical formalization of internal and external variability are strikingly
similar.

chemical driving forces of complex molecular processes. Despite continued
advancement of simulation methodology, model errors may lead to inconsistencies
between simulated and reference (e.g., from experiments or higher-level
simulations) observables. To bound the microscopic information generated by
computer simulations within reference measurements, we propose a method that
reweights the microscopic transitions of the system to improve consistency with
a set of coarse kinetic observables. The method employs the well-developed
Markov state modeling framework to efficiently link microscopic dynamics with
long-time scale constraints, thereby consistently addressing a wide range of
time scales. To emphasize the robustness of the method, we consider two
distinct coarse-grained models with significant kinetic inconsistencies. When
applied to the simulated conformational dynamics of small peptides, the
reweighting procedure systematically improves the time scale separation of the
slowest processes. Additionally, constraining the forward and backward rates
between metastable states leads to slight improvement of their relative
stabilities and, thus, refined equilibrium properties of the resulting model.
Finally, we find that difficulties in simultaneously describing both the
simulated data and the provided constraints can help identify specific
limitations of the underlying simulation approach.

metabolism. It has been extensively studied experimentally and mathematically
at the unicellular level to broaden our understanding of its regulatory
mechanisms at higher order species. Although the key molecular players involved
in the metabolic and regulatory processes underlying this system have been
known for decades, their interactions and chemical kinetics remain incompletely
understood. Mathematical models can provide an alternative method to study the
dynamics of this network from a quantitative and a qualitative perspective.
Here, we employ such approaches to unravel the main properties of the galactose
network, including equilibrium binary and temporal responses, as a way to
decipher its adaptation to actively-changing inputs. We combine the two main
components of the network; namely, the genetic branch which allows for bistable
responses, and a metabolic branch, encompassing the relevant metabolic
processes and glucose repressive reactions. We use both computational tools to
estimate model parameters based on published experimental data, as well as
bifurcation analysis to decipher the properties of the system in various
parameter regimes. Our model analysis reveals that the interplay between the
inducer (galactose) and the repressor (glucose) creates the bistability regime
which dictates the temporal responses of the system. Based on the same
bifurcation techniques, we can also explain why the system is robust to genetic
mutations and molecular instabilities. These findings may provide
experimentalists with a theoretical framework upon which they can determine how
the galactose network functions under various conditions.

determine neighbouring competitors of a tree. There were studied the
correlations between APA values and the main biometrical attributes, height
growth and competition indices. Furthermore, it is shown that APA coefficient
of variation is a straight-forward indicator with positive results as an
indicator of spatial pattern. The statistical significance of this indicator
was evaluated by comparing the results with the values of a 95% confidence
envelope generated by Monte-Carlo simulations. Two practical software tools
were produced using Visual Basic (VORONOI and ARIA VORONOI) in order to
simplify the analyses.

give reason to doubt the feasibility of artificial intelligence? This report
will review some relevant estimates of brain bioenergetics and analyze some of
the methods of estimating brain emulation energy requirements. Turning to AI,
there are reasons to believe the energy requirements for de novo AI to have
little correlation with brain (emulation) energy requirements since cost could
depend merely of the cost of processing higher-level representations rather
than billions of neural firings. Unless one thinks the human way of thinking is
the most optimal or most easily implementable way of achieving software
intelligence, we should expect de novo AI to make use of different, potentially
very compressed and fast, processes.

  State on the Unfolding Pathway"	"  Ranaspumin-2 (Rsn-2) is a surfactant protein found in the foam nests of the
t\'{u}ngara frog. Previous experimental work has led to a proposed model of
adsorption which involves an unusual clam shell-like `unhinging' of the protein
at an interface. Interestingly, there is no concomitant denaturation of the
secondary structural elements of Rsn-2 with the large scale transformation of
its tertiary structure. In this work we use both experiment and simulation to
better understand the driving forces underpinning this unusual process. We
develop a modified G\={o}-model approach where we have included explicit
representation of the side-chains in order to realistically model the
interaction between the secondary structure elements of the protein and the
interface. Doing so allows for the study of the underlying energy landscape
which governs the mechanism of Rsn-2 interfacial adsorption. Experimentally, we
study targeted mutants of Rsn-2, using the Langmuir trough, pendant drop
tensiometry and circular dichroism, to demonstrate that the clam-shell model is
correct. We find that Rsn-2 adsorption is in fact a two-step process: the
hydrophobic N-terminal tail recruits the protein to the interface after which
Rsn-2 undergoes an unfolding transition which maintains its secondary
structure. Intriguingly, our simulations show that the conformation Rsn-2
adopts at an interface is an arrested state along the denaturation pathway.
More generally, our computational model should prove a useful, and
computationally efficient, tool in studying the dynamics and energetics of
protein-interface interactions.

rather then continuous synaptic states. The choice of discrete synapses is
motivated by biological reasoning and experiments, and possibly by hardware
implementation considerations as well. In this paper we extend a previous large
deviations analysis which unveiled the existence of peculiar dense regions in
the space of synaptic states which accounts for the possibility of learning
efficiently in networks with binary synapses. We extend the analysis to
synapses with multiple states and generally more plausible biological features.
The results clearly indicate that the overall qualitative picture is unchanged
with respect to the binary case, and very robust to variation of the details of
the model. We also provide quantitative results which suggest that the
advantages of increasing the synaptic precision (i.e.~the number of internal
synaptic states) rapidly vanish after the first few bits, and therefore that,
for practical applications, only few bits may be needed for near-optimal
performance, consistently with recent biological findings. Finally, we
demonstrate how the theoretical analysis can be exploited to design efficient
algorithmic search strategies.

  protein mNeonGreen as FRET donor"	"  Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the universal chemical energy currency for
cellular activities provided mainly by the membrane enzyme FoF1-ATP synthase in
bacteria, chloroplasts and mitochondria. Synthesis of ATP is accompanied by
subunit rotation within the enzyme. Over the past 15 years we have developed a
variety of single-molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments to monitor catalytic
action of individual bacterial enzymes in vitro. By specifically labeling
rotating and static subunits within a single enzyme we were able to observe
three-stepped rotation in the F1 motor, ten-stepped rotation in the Fo motor
and transient elastic deformation of the connected rotor subunits. However, the
spatial and temporal resolution of motor activities measured by smFRET were
limited by the photophysics of the FRET fluorophores. Here we evaluate the
novel FRET donor mNeonGreen as a fusion to FoF1-ATP synthase and compare it to
the previously used fluorophore EGFP. Topics of this manuscript are the
biochemical purification procedures and the activity measurements of the fully
functional mutant enzyme.

Increasingly, researchers need to visualize large trees and compare multiple
large trees inferred for the same set of taxa (reflecting uncertainty in the
tree inference or genuine discordance among the loci analysed). Existing tree
visualization tools are however not well suited to these tasks. In particular,
side-by-side comparison of trees can prove challenging beyond a few dozen taxa.
Here, we introduce Phylo.io, a web application to visualize and compare
phylogenetic trees side-by-side. Its distinctive features are: highlighting of
similarities and differences between two trees, automatic identification of the
best matching rooting and leaf order, scalability to very large trees, high
usability, multiplatform support via standard HTML5 implementation, and
possibility to store and share visualisations. The tool can be freely accessed

structure biology over the last few decades. Protein quality assessment plays a
very important role in protein structure prediction. In the paper, we propose a
new protein quality assessment method which can predict both local and global
quality of the protein 3D structural models. Our method uses both multi and
single model quality assessment method for global quality assessment, and uses
chemical, physical, geo-metrical features, and global quality score for local
quality assessment. CASP9 targets are used to generate the features for local
quality assessment. We evaluate the performance of our local quality assessment
method on CASP10, which is comparable with two stage-of-art QA methods based on
the average absolute distance between the real and predicted distance. In
addition, we blindly tested our method on CASP11, and the good performance
shows that combining single and multiple model quality assessment method could
be a good way to improve the accuracy of model quality assessment, and the
random forest technique could be used to train a good local quality assessment
model.

1602.04368	q-bio	cs.DS q-bio.PE	Fast Computation of the Kinship Coefficients	"  For families, kinship coefficients are quantifications of the amount of
genetic sharing between a pair of individuals. These coefficients are critical
for understanding the breeding habits and genetic diversity of diploid
populations. Historically, computations of the inbreeding coefficient were used
to prohibit inbred marriages and prohibit breeding of some pairs of pedigree
animals. Such prohibitions foster genetic diversity and help prevent recessive
Mendelian disease at a population level.
  This paper gives the fastest known algorithms for computing the kinship
coefficient of a set of individuals with a known pedigree. The algorithms given
here consider the possibility that the founders of the known pedigree may
themselves be inbred, and they compute the appropriate inbreeding-adjusted
kinship coefficients. The exact kinship algorithm has running-time $O(n^2)$ for
an $n$-individual pedigree. The recursive-cut exact kinship algorithm has
running time $O(s^2m)$ where $s$ is the number of individuals in the largest
segment of the pedigree and $m$ is the number of cuts. The approximate
algorithm has running-time $O(n)$ for an $n$-individual pedigree on which to
estimate the kinship coefficients of $\sqrt{n}$ individuals from $\sqrt{n}$
founder kinship coefficients.

Bz-423 to mitochondria in living cells and how subunit rotation in FoF1-ATP

Bz-423. Therefore, the enzyme was marked selectively by genetic fusion with the

at superresolution using structured illumination microscopy, SIM. We measured

  analysis"	"  Despite the evaluation systems of human movement that have been advancing in
recent decades, their use are not feasible for clinical practice because it has
a high cost and scarcity of trained operators to interpret their results. An
ideal videogrammetry system should be easy to use, low cost, with minimal
equipment, and fast realization. The CvMob is a free tool for dynamic
evaluation of human movements that express measurements in figures, tables, and
graphics. This paper aims to determine if CvMob is a reliable tool for the
evaluation of two dimensional human gait. This is a validity and reliability
study. The sample was composed of 56 healthy individuals who walked on a
9-meterlong walkway and were simultaneously filmed by CvMob and Vicon system
cameras. Linear trajectories and angular measurements were compared to validate
the CvMob system, and inter and intrarater findings of the same measurements
were used to determine reliability. A strong correlation (rs mean = 0.988) of
the linear trajectories between systems and inter and intrarater analysis were
found. According to the Bland-Altman method, the angles that had good agreement
between systems were maximum flexion and extension (stance and swing) of the
knee and dorsiflexion range of motion and stride length. The CvMob is a
reliable tool for analysis of linear motion and lengths in two-dimensional
evaluations of human gait. The angular measurements demonstrate high agreement
for the knee joint; however, the hip and ankle measurements were limited by
differences between systems.

1602.04671	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Phylogenetic mixtures and linear invariants for equal input models	"  The reconstruction of phylogenetic trees from molecular sequence data relies
on modelling site substitutions by a Markov process, or a mixture of such
processes. In general, allowing mixed processes can result in different tree
topologies becoming indistinguishable from the data, even for infinitely long
sequences. However, when the underlying Markov process supports linear
phylogenetic invariants, then provided these are sufficiently informative, the
identifiability of the tree topology can be restored. In this paper, we
investigate a class of processes that support linear invariants once the
stationary distribution is fixed, the `equal input model'. This model
generalizes the `Felsenstein 1981' model (and thereby the Jukes--Cantor model)
from four states to an arbitrary number of states (finite or infinite), and it
can also be described by a `random cluster' process. We describe the structure
and dimension of the vector spaces of phylogenetic mixtures and of linear
invariants for any fixed phylogenetic tree (and for all trees -- the so called
`model invariants'), on any number $n$ of leaves. We also provide a precise
description of the space of mixtures and linear invariants for the special case
of $n=4$ leaves. By combining techniques from discrete random processes and
(multi-) linear algebra, our results build on a classic result that was first
established by James Lake in 1987.

intensive care units (ICUs). The data comprise admission and discharge dates,

  oligonucleotide strands in thermal equilibrium"	"  The specificity of molecular recognition is important to molecular
self-organization. A prominent example is the biological cell where, within a
highly crowded molecular environment, a myriad of different molecular receptor
pairs recognize their binding partner with astonishing accuracy. In thermal
equilibrium it is usually admitted that the affinity of recognizer pairs only
depends on the nature of the two binding molecules. Accordingly, Boltzmann
factors of binding energy differences relate the molecular affinities among
different target molecules that compete for the same probe. Here, we consider
the molecular recognition of short DNA oligonucleotide single strands. We show
that a better matching oligonucleotide strand can prevail against a
disproportionally more concentrated competitor that exhibits reduced affinity
due to a mismatch. The magnitude of deviation from the simple picture above may
reach several orders of magnitude. In our experiments the effective molecular
affinity of a given strand remains elevated only as long as the better matching
competitor is not present. We interpret our observations based on an
energy-barrier of entropic origin that occurs if two competing oligonucleotide
strands occupy the same probe simultaneously. In this situation the relative
binding affinities are reduced asymmetrically, which leads to an expression of
the free energy landscape that represents a formal analogue of a Landau
description of phase transitions. Our mean field description reproduces the
observations in quantitative agreement. The advantage of improved molecular
recognition comes at no energetic cost other than the design of the molecular
ensemble, and the introduction of the competitor. It will be interesting to see
if mechanisms along similar lines as exposed here, contribute to the molecular
synergy that occurs in biological systems.

1602.04742	q-bio	cs.NE q-bio.NC	Training of spiking neural networks based on information theoretic costs	"  Spiking neural network is a type of artificial neural network in which
neurons communicate between each other with spikes. Spikes are identical
Boolean events characterized by the time of their arrival. A spiking neuron has
internal dynamics and responds to the history of inputs as opposed to the
current inputs only. Because of such properties a spiking neural network has
rich intrinsic capabilities to process spatiotemporal data. However, because
the spikes are discontinuous 'yes or no' events, it is not trivial to apply
traditional training procedures such as gradient descend to the spiking
neurons. In this thesis we propose to use stochastic spiking neuron models in
which probability of a spiking output is a continuous function of parameters.
We formulate several learning tasks as minimization of certain
information-theoretic cost functions that use spiking output probability
distributions. We develop a generalized description of the stochastic spiking
neuron and a new spiking neuron model that allows to flexibly process rich
spatiotemporal data. We formulate and derive learning rules for the following
tasks:
  - a supervised learning task of detecting a spatiotemporal pattern as a
minimization of the negative log-likelihood (the surprisal) of the neuron's
output
  - an unsupervised learning task of increasing the stability of neurons output
as a minimization of the entropy
  - a reinforcement learning task of controlling an agent as a modulated
optimization of filtered surprisal of the neuron's output.
  We test the derived learning rules in several experiments such as
spatiotemporal pattern detection, spatiotemporal data storing and recall with
autoassociative memory, combination of supervised and unsupervised learning to
speed up the learning process, adaptive control of simple virtual agents in
changing environments.

1602.04773	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Competing metabolic strategies in a multilevel selection model	"  The interplay between energy efficiency and evolutionary mechanisms is
addressed. One important question is how evolutionary mechanisms can select for
the optimised usage of energy in situations where it does not lead to immediate
advantage. For example, this problem is of great importance to improve our
understanding about the major transition from unicellular to multicellular form
of life. The immediate advantage of gathering efficient individuals in an
energetic context is not clear. Although this process increases relatedness
among individuals, it also increases local competition. To address this
question, we propose a model of two competing metabolic strategies that makes
explicit reference to the resource usage. We assume the existence of an
efficient strain, which converts resource into energy at high efficiency but
displays a low rate of resource consumption, and an inefficient strain, which
consumes resource at a high rate with a low efficiency in converting it to
energy. We explore the dynamics in both well-mixed and structured populations.
The selection for optimised energy usage is measured by the likelihood of that
an efficient strain can invade a population only comprised by inefficient
strains. It is found that the region of the parameter space at which the
efficient strain can thrive in structured populations is always larger than
observed in well-mixed populations. In fact, in well-mixed populations the
efficient strain is only evolutionarily stable in the domain whereupon there is
no evolutionary dilemma. We also observe that small group sizes enhance the
chance of invasion by the efficient strain in spite of increasing the
competition among relatives. This outcome corroborates the key role played by
kin selection and shows that the group dynamics relied on group expansion,
overlapping generations and group split can balance the negative effects of
local competition.

that this constrained system may be described as a perturbation from a system

1602.05167	q-bio	q-bio.MN	The economic basis of periodic enzyme dynamics	"  Periodic enzyme activities can improve the metabolic performance of cells. As
an adaptation to periodic environments or by driving metabolic cycles that can
shift fluxes and rearrange metabolic processes in time to increase their
efficiency. To study what benefits can ensue from rhythmic gene expression or
posttranslational modification of enzymes, I propose a theory of optimal enzyme
rhythms in periodic or static environments. The theory is based on kinetic
metabolic models with predefined metabolic objectives, scores the effects of
harmonic enzyme oscillations, and determines amplitudes and phase shifts that
maximise cell fitness. In an expansion around optimal steady states, the
optimal enzyme profiles can be computed by solving a quadratic optimality
problem. The formulae show how enzymes can increase their efficiency by
oscillating in phase with their substrates and how cells can benefit from
adapting to external rhythms and from spontaneous, intrinsic enzyme rhythms.
Both types of behaviour may occur different parameter regions of the same
model. Optimal enzyme profiles are not passively adapted to existing substrate
rhythms, but shape them actively to create opportunities for further fitness
advantage: in doing so, they reflect the dynamic effects that enzymes can exert
in the network. The proposed theory combines the dynamics and economics of
metabolic systems and shows how optimal enzyme profiles are shaped by network
structure, dynamics, external rhythms, and metabolic objectives. It covers
static enzyme adaptation as a special case, reveals the conditions for
beneficial metabolic cycles, and predicts optimally combinations of gene
expression and posttranslational modification for creating enzyme rhythms.

number of substitutions during molecular evolution of a sequence can be

variance of this random variable. We show in this article that the computation

both short and long times. Apart from its fundamental importance, this result
can be used to investigate the dispersion index R , i.e. the ratio of the
variance to the mean substitution number, which is of prime importance in the
neutral theory of molecular evolution. By investigating large classes of
substitution models, we demonstrate that although R\ge1 , to obtain R
significantly larger than unity necessitates in general additional hypotheses

Mean-field models are common in many fields, but their convergence is rarely

thus significantly reducing the complexity of the model. Network clustering is
incorporated into the model to provide a more accurate representation of
realistic contact networks, and the accuracy of proposed closures is analysed
for different levels of clustering and number of infection stages. Our results
support recent findings that standard closure techniques are likely to perform

also gives an indication of the presence, abundance, and evolutionary

traditional, fixed-rank taxonomic profile which is shown on independently
simulated data to be one of the most accurate to date. Tree figures are also
returned that quantify the relatedness of novel organisms to reference
sequences and the accuracy of such figures is demonstrated on simulated

efforts has increased dramatically in recent decades. A scientific
understanding of the reason for this increase would provide guidance as to the
contexts in which SOF can be used to their best effect. Ashby's law of
requisite variety provides a scientific framework for understanding and
analyzing a system's ability to survive and prosper in the face of
environmental challenges. We have developed a generalization of this law to
extend the analysis to systems that must respond to disturbances at multiple
scales. This analysis identifies a necessary tradeoff between scale and
complexity in a multiscale control system. As with Ashby's law, the framework
applies to the characterization of successful biological and social systems in
the context of complex environmental challenges. Here we apply this multiscale
framework to provide a control theoretic understanding of the historical and
increasing need for SOF, as well as conventional military forces. We propose
that the essential role distinction is in the separation between high
complexity fine scale challenges as opposed to large scale challenges. This
leads to a correspondence between the role SOF can best serve and that of the
immune system in complex organisms--namely, the ability to respond to
fine-grained, high-complexity disruptors and preserve tissue health. Much like
a multicellular organism, human civilization is composed of a set of distinct
and heterogeneous social tissues. Responding to disruption and restoring health
in a system with highly diverse local social conditions is an essentially
complex task. SOF have the potential to mitigate against harm without
disrupting normal social tissue behavior. This analysis suggests how SOF might
be leveraged to support global stability and mitigate against cascading crises.

coupled to it. To introduce basic ideas, we consider a well known dynamical
system composed of two master-slave coupled Lorenz oscillators. We start
evidencing that due to the sensitivity of $\Delta$ computed from temporal time
series of slave oscillator, its is possible to detect the stationary breaking
imposed in the master oscillator. As a second example, the method is carried
out in a real physiological data acquired from accelerometer sensors
($\mathrm{A_{cc}}$) and used to detect micro arousal phenomenology (described
by a sharp burst in $\mathrm{A_{cc}}$ signal) during sleep periods in mice.
Moreover, we show for the first time that making use of recurrence quantifier
it is possible to infer a coupling between electric signals from hippocampus
and ""locomotor brain areas"" of mice, based only on non invasive data from
$\mathrm{A_{cc}}$. Our results suggest new possibilities of analysis of coupled
systems making use of accessible time series. Our second example supports an
interpretation of an internal coupling detectable as a stationarity breaking in
$\mathrm{A_{cc}}$ that occurs some seconds before micro arousal processes
during sleep periods in rodents, contributing to the idea that micro arousals
are elements of sleep taking part in the regulation of sleep process. Such a
characterization of micro arousals can improve our knowledge about sleep
fostering tools of sleep diagnose and pharmacology research for mammals in
general.

target on a bounded domain. The searcher proceeds along ballistic trajectories
and is absorbed upon collision with the target boundary. When reaching the
domain boundary, the searcher chooses a random direction for its new
trajectory. For circular domains and targets, we can approximate the mean first
passage time (MFPT) using a Markov chain approximation of the search process.
Our analysis and numerical simulations reveal that the time to find the target
decreases for targets closer to the domain boundary. When there is a small
probability of direction-switching within the domain, we find the time to find
the target decreases slightly with the turning probability. We also extend our
exit time analysis to the case of partitioned domains, where there is a single
target within one of multiple disjoint subdomains. Given an average time of
transition between domains $\langle T \rangle$, we find that the optimal rate
of transition that minimizes the time to find the target obeys $\beta_{{\rm
min}} \propto 1/ \sqrt{\langle T \rangle}$.

  behaviors of cell populations"	"  A rigorous understanding of how multicellular behaviors arise from the
actions of single cells requires quantitative frameworks that bridge the gap
between genetic circuits, the arrangement of cells in space, and
population-level behaviors. Here, we provide such a framework for a ubiquitous
class of multicellular systems - namely, ""secrete-and-sense cells"" that
communicate by secreting and sensing a signaling molecule. By using formal,
mathematical arguments and introducing the concept of a phenotype diagram, we
show how these cells tune their degrees of autonomous and collective behavior
to realize distinct single-cell and population-level phenotypes; these
phenomena have biological analogs, such as quorum sensing or paracrine
signaling. We also define the ""entropy of population,"" a measurement of the
number of arrangements that a population of cells can assume, and demonstrate
how a decrease in the entropy of population accompanies the formation of
ordered spatial patterns. Our conceptual framework ties together diverse
systems, including tissues and microbes, with common principles.

1602.05649	q-bio	cond-mat.soft physics.bio-ph q-bio.MN	The Information Capacity of Specific Interactions	"  Specific interactions are a hallmark feature of self-assembly and
signal-processing systems in both synthetic and biological settings.
Specificity between components may arise from a wide variety of physical and
chemical mechanisms in diverse contexts, from DNA hybridization to
shape-sensitive depletion interactions. Despite this diversity, all systems
that rely on interaction specificity operate under the constraint that
increasing the number of distinct components inevitably increases off-target
binding. Here we introduce `capacity', the maximal information encodable using
specific interactions, to compare specificity across diverse experimental
systems, and to compute how specificity changes with physical parameters. Using
this framework, we find that `shape'-coding of interactions has higher capacity
than chemical (`color') coding because the strength of off-target binding is
strongly sublinear in binding site size for shapes while being linear for
colors. We also find that different specificity mechanisms, such as shape and
color, can be combined in a synergistic manner, giving a capacity greater than
the sum of the parts.

1602.05652	q-bio	physics.bio-ph physics.chem-ph q-bio.BM	The effect of base pair mismatch on DNA strand displacement	"  DNA strand displacement is a key reaction in DNA homologous recombination and
DNA mismatch repair and is also heavily utilized in DNA-based computation and
locomotion. Despite its ubiquity in science and engineering, sequence-dependent
effects of displacement kinetics have not been extensively characterized. Here,
we measured toehold-mediated strand displacement kinetics using single-molecule
fluorescence in the presence of a single base pair mismatch. The apparent
displacement rate varied significantly when the mismatch was introduced in the
invading DNA strand. The rate generally decreased as the mismatch in the
invader was encountered earlier in displacement. Our data indicate that a
single base pair mismatch in the invader stalls branch migration, and
displacement occurs via direct dissociation of the destabilized incumbent
strand from the substrate strand. We combined both branch migration and direct
dissociation into a model, which we term, the concurrent displacement model,
and used the first passage time approach to quantitatively explain the salient
features of the observed relationship. We also introduce the concept of
splitting probabilities to justify that the concurrent model can be simplified
into a three-step sequential model in the presence of an invader mismatch. We
expect our model to become a powerful tool to design DNA-based reaction schemes
with broad functionality.

  potential: A quantitative conservation conflict attempt"	"  Protected areas are an important conservation measure. However, there are
controversial findings regarding whether closed areas are beneficial for
species and habitat conservation as well as landings. Species dispersal is
acknowledged as a key factor for the design and impacts of closed areas. A
series of agent based models using random diffusion to model fish dispersal
were run before and after habitat protection. All results were normalised
without the protected habitat in each scenario to detect the relative
difference after closing an area, all else being equal. Results show that
landings of species with short dispersal ranges will take longer to reach the
levels of pre Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) establishment than landings of
species with long dispersal ranges. Further the establishment of an MPA
generates a higher relative population source within the MPA for species with
low dispersal abilities than for species with high dispersal abilities. Results
derived here show that there exists a win-win feasible scenario that maximises
both fish biomass as well as fish catches.

  a mixed society of animals and robots"	"  Animal and robotic collective behaviours can exhibit complex dynamics that
require multi-level descriptions. Here, we are interested in developing a
multi-level modeling framework for the use of robots in studies about animal
collective decision-making. In this context, using robots can be useful for
validating models in silico, inducing calibrated repetitive stimuli to trigger
animal responses or modulating and controlling animal collective behaviour.
However, designing appropriate biomimetic robotic behaviour faces a major
challenge: how to go from the collective decision dynamics observed with
animals to an actual algorithmic implementation in robots. In previous work,
this was mainly done by hand, often by taking inspiration from human-designed
models. Typically, models of behaviour are either macroscopic, differential
equations of the population dynamics, or microscopic,explicit spatio-temporal
state of each individual. Only microscopic models can easily be implemented as
robot controllers. Here, we address the problem of automating the design of
lower level description models that can be implemented in robots and exhibit
the same collective dynamics as a given higher level model. We apply
evolutionary algorithms to simultaneously optimise the parameters of models
accounting for different levels of description. This methodology is applied to
an experimentally validated shelter-selection problem solved by gregarious
insects and robots. We successfully design and calibrate automatically both a
microscopic and a hybrid model exhibiting the same dynamics as a macroscopic
one. Our framework can be used for multi-level modeling of collective behaviour
in animal or robot populations and bio-hybrid systems.

close it is to its native structure, using no other information than the
structure of the model has been shown to be useful for structure prediction.
The state of the art method, ProQ2, is based on a machine learning approach
that uses a number of features calculated from a protein model. Here, we
examine if these features can be exchanged with energy terms calculated from
Rosetta and if a combination of these terms can improve the quality assessment.
Results: When using the full atom energy function from Rosetta in ProQRosFA the
QA is on par with our previous state-of-the-art method, ProQ2. The method based
on the low-resolution centroid scoring function, ProQRosCen, performs almost as
well and the combination of all the three methods, ProQ2, ProQRosFA and
ProQCenFA into ProQ3 show superior performance over ProQ2. Availability: ProQ3

1602.05847	q-bio	q-bio.OT	Chirality in a quaternionic representation of the genetic code	"  A quaternionic representation of the genetic code, previously reported by the
authors, is updated in order to incorporate chirality of nucleotide bases and
amino acids. The original representation assigns to each nucleotide base a
prime integer quaternion of norm 7 and involves a function that associates with
each codon, represented by three of these quaternions, another integer
quaternion (amino acid type quaternion) in such a way that the essentials of
the standard genetic code (particulaty its degeneration) are preserved. To show
the advantages of such a quaternionic representation we have, in turn,
associated with each amino acid of a given protein, besides of the type
quaternion, another real one according to its order along the protein (order
quaternion) and have designed an algorithm to go from the primary to the
tertiary structure of the protein by using type and order quaternions. In this
context, we incorporate chirality in our representation by observing that the
set of eight integer quaternions of norm 7 can be partitioned into a pair of
subsets of cardinality four each with their elements mutually conjugates and by
putting they in correspondence one to one with the two sets of enantiomers (D
and L) of the four nucleotide bases adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil,
respectively. Thus, guided by two diagrams proposed for the codes evolution, we
define functions that in each case assign a L- (D-) amino acid type integer
quaternion to the triplets of D- (L-) bases. The assignation is such that for a
given D-amino acid, the associated integer quaternion is the conjugate of that
one corresponding to the enantiomer L. The chiral type quaternions obtained for
the amino acids are used, together with a common set of order quaternions, to
describe the folding of the two classes, L and D, of homochiral proteins.

two small single-domain proteins at the ribosomal exit tunnel by using Langevin
dynamics with coarse-grained models. It is shown that at temperatures lower or
near the temperature of the fastest folding, folding proceeds concomitantly
with the escape process, resulting in vectorial folding and enhancement of
foldability of nascent proteins. The concomitance between the two processes,
however, deteriorates as temperature increases. Our folding simulations as well
as free energy calculation by using umbrella sampling show that, at low
temperatures, folding at the tunnel follows one or two specific pathways
without kinetic traps. It is shown that the escape time can be mapped to a
one-dimensional diffusion model with two different regimes for temperatures
above and below the folding transition temperature. Attractive interactions
between amino acids and attractive sites on the tunnel wall lead to a free
energy barrier along the escape route of protein. It is suggested that this
barrier slows down the escape process and consequently promotes correct folding
of the released nascent protein.

interact continuously with the environment and with each other. It is fair to
assume that during their evolution they developed particular features to
overcome problems and to exploit possibilities from environment. In this paper
we introduce various quantitative measures based on recent advancements in
complex network theory that allow to measure the effective similarities of
various species. By using this approach on the similarity in fruit-typology
ecological traits we obtain a clear plant classification in a way similar to
traditional taxonomic classification. This result is not trivial, since a
similar analysis done on the basis of diaspore morphological properties do not
provide any clear parameter to classify plants species. Complex network theory
can then be used in order to determine which feature amongst many can be used
to distinguish scope and possibly evolution of plants. Future uses of this
approach range from functional classification to quantitative determination of
plant communities in nature.

risk of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases and microangiopathies in
addition to the serious global health concern related to its carcinogenic
effects. In experiments on animals, acute and chronic exposure to arsenic
directly correlates cardiac tachyarrhythmia, and atherogenesis in a
concentration and duration dependent manner. Moreover, the other effects of
long-term arsenic exposure include induction of non-insulin dependent diabetes
by mechanisms yet to be understood. On the other hand, there are controversial
issues, gaps in knowledge, and future research priorities of accelerated
incidences of CVD and mortalities in patients with HIV who are under long-term
anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Although, both HIV infection itself and various
components of ART initiate significant pathological alterations in the
myocardium and the vasculature, simultaneous environmental exposure to arsenic
which is more convincingly being recognized as a facilitator of HIV viral
cycling in the infected immune cells, may contribute an additional layer of
adversity in these patients. In this mini-review which have been fortified with
our own preliminary data, we will discuss some of the key current understating
of chronic arsenic exposure, and its possible impact on the accelerated HIV/ART
induced CVD. The review will conclude with notes on recent developments in
mathematical modeling in this field that probabilistically forecast incidence
prevalence as functions of aging and life style parameters, most of which vary
with time themselves; this interdisciplinary approach provides a complementary

under the action of external force is studied within the framework of
phenomenological approach. When considering the task it is taken into account
that double-stranded DNA is a polymorphic macromolecule with a set of
metastable states. Accordingly to proposed mechanism, DNA threshold elongation
can take place as a cooperative structural transition of macromolecule to
metastable form, which is stabilized by the external force. For the description
of DNA overstretching, the model included external (stretching) and internal
(conformation) displacement components is constructed. As assumed, both
components are coupled on the pathway of double helix transformations. It is
shown, that under force action DNA deformation proceeds in two stages. First
one is the restructuring of the double helix, which leads to formation of
conformational bistability in DNA macromolecule. On the second stage, the
conformational transition and the deformation induced by it consistently cover
the macromolecule as a threshold process. The comparison of calculated
characteristics of DNA overstretching process with experimental data shows good
agreement. Analysis of the results obtained, together with the available
literature data allow to conclude, that overstretching transition in the double
helix is dynamical process and can spread in DNA chain. In the same time, in
DNA with A$\cdot$T-rich content due to large dissipation the overstretching
process leads to force induced melting transition, and should have nearly
static character.

contains gene expression data from over a million experiments, using Luminex
Bead technology. Only 500 colors are used to measure the expression levels of
the 1,000 landmark genes measured, and the data for the resulting pairs of
genes are deconvolved. The raw data are sometimes inadequate for reliable
deconvolution leading to artifacts in the final processed data. These include
the expression levels of paired genes being flipped or given the same value,
and clusters of values that are not at the true expression level. We propose a
new method called model-based clustering with data correction (MCDC) that is
able to identify and correct these three kinds of artifacts simultaneously. We
show that MCDC improves the resulting gene expression data in terms of
agreement with external baselines, as well as improving results from subsequent
analysis.

remains prob- lematic for genes with low expression or several isoforms. These
difficulties may in principle be ameliorated by exploiting correlated
experimental designs, such as time series or dosage response experiments. Time
series RNA-seq experiments, in particular, are becoming in- creasingly popular,
yet there are no methods that explicitly leverage the experimental design to
improve isoform quantification. Here we present DICEseq, the first isoform
quantification method tailored to correlated RNA-seq experiments. DICEseq
explicitly models the corre- lations between different RNA-seq experiments to
aid the quantification of isoforms across experiments. Numerical experiments on
simulated data sets show that DICEseq yields more accurate results than
state-of-the-art methods, an advantage that can become considerable at low
coverage levels. On real data sets, our results show that DICEseq provides
substan- tially more reproducible and robust quantifications, increasing the
correlation of estimates from replicate data sets by up to 10% on genes with
low or moderate expression levels (bot- tom third of all genes). Furthermore,
DICEseq permits to quantify the trade-off between temporal sampling of RNA and
depth of sequencing, frequently an important choice when planning experiments.
Our results have strong implications for the design of RNA-seq ex- periments,
and offer a novel tool for improved analysis of such data sets. Python code is

interacting partners is an effective individualized control strategy.
Intuitively, it is done either by shortening the interaction time between
susceptible and infected individuals or by increasing the opportunities for
contact between susceptible individuals. Here, we provide a comparative study
on these two control strategies by establishing an epidemic model with
non-uniform stochastic interactions. It seems that the two strategies should be
similar, since shortening the interaction time between susceptible and infected
individuals somehow increases the chances for contact between susceptible
individuals. However, analytical results indicate that the effectiveness of the
former strategy sensitively depends on the infectious intensity and the
combinations of different interaction rates, whereas the latter one is quite
robust and efficient. Simulations are shown in comparison with our analytical
predictions. Our work may shed light on the strategic choice of disease
control.

  Patterning against Complete Spatial Randomness"	"  We derive generalized estimators for a number of spatial statistics that have
been used in the analysis of spatially resolved omics data, such as Ripley's K,
H and L functions, clustering index, and degree of clustering, which allow
these statistics to be calculated on data modelled by arbitrary random measures
(RMs). Our estimators generalize those typically used to calculate these
statistics on point process data, allowing them to be calculated on RMs which
assign continuous values to spatial regions, for instance to model protein
intensity. The clustering index (H*) compares Ripley's H function calculated
empirically to its distribution under complete spatial randomness (CSR),
leading us to consider CSR null hypotheses for RMs which are not
point-processes when generalizing this statistic. We thus consider restricted
classes of completely random measures which can be simulated directly (Gamma
processes and Marked Poisson Processes), as well as the general class of all
CSR RMs, for which we derive an exact permutation-based H* estimator. We
establish several properties of the estimators, including bounds on the
accuracy of our general Ripley K estimator, its relationship to a previous
estimator for the cross-correlation measure, and the relationship of our
generalized H* estimator to previous statistics. To test the ability of our
approach to identify spatial patterning, we use Fluorescent In Situ
Hybridization (FISH) and Immunofluorescence (IF) data to probe for mRNA and
protein subcellular localization patterns respectively in polarizing mouse
fibroblasts on micropattened cells. We observe correlated patterns of
clustering over time for corresponding mRNAs and proteins, suggesting a
deterministic effect of mRNA localization on protein localization for several
pairs tested, including one case in which spatial patterning at the mRNA level
has not been previously demonstrated.

1602.06466	q-bio	q-bio.QM	Analysis of animal accelerometer data using hidden Markov models	"  Use of accelerometers is now widespread within animal biotelemetry as they
provide a means of measuring an animal's activity in a meaningful and
quantitative way where direct observation is not possible. In sequential
acceleration data there is a natural dependence between observations of
movement or behaviour, a fact that has been largely ignored in most analyses.
Analyses of acceleration data where serial dependence has been explicitly
modelled have largely relied on hidden Markov models (HMMs). Depending on the
aim of an analysis, either a supervised or an unsupervised learning approach
can be applied. Under a supervised context, an HMM is trained to classify
unlabelled acceleration data into a finite set of pre-specified categories,
whereas we will demonstrate how an unsupervised learning approach can be used
to infer new aspects of animal behaviour. We will provide the details necessary
to implement and assess an HMM in both the supervised and unsupervised context,
and discuss the data requirements of each case. We outline two applications to
marine and aerial systems (sharks and eagles) taking the unsupervised approach,
which is more readily applicable to animal activity measured in the field. HMMs
were used to infer the effects of temporal, atmospheric and tidal inputs on
animal behaviour. Animal accelerometer data allow ecologists to identify
important correlates and drivers of animal activity (and hence behaviour). The
HMM framework is well suited to deal with the main features commonly observed
in accelerometer data. The ability to combine direct observations of animals
activity and combine it with statistical models which account for the features
of accelerometer data offer a new way to quantify animal behaviour, energetic
expenditure and deepen our insights into individual behaviour as a constituent
of populations and ecosystems.

represents a significant problem in disease management and has socio-economic
implications. Development of genetic and molecular markers of clinically
significant disease in patients diagnosed with low grade localized PC would
have a major impact in disease management. A gene expression signature (GES) is
reported for lethal PC in biopsy specimens obtained at the time of diagnosis
from patients with Gleason 6 and Gleason 7 tumors in a Swedish watchful waiting
cohort with up to 30 years follow-up. A 98-genes GES identified 89 and 100
percent of all death events 4 years after diagnosis in G7 and G6 patients,
respectively; at 6 years follow-up, 83 and 100 percent of all deaths events
were captured. Remarkably, the 98-genes GES appears to perform successfully in
patients stratification with as little as 2% of cancer cells in a specimen,
strongly indicating that it captures a malignant field effect in prostates
harboring cancer cells of different degrees of aggressiveness. In G6 and G7
tumors from PC patients of age 65 or younger, GES identified 86 percent of all
death events during the entire follow-up period. In G6 and G7 tumors from PC
patients of age 70 or younger, GES identified 90 percent of all death events 6
years after diagnosis. Classification performance of the reported in this study
98-genes GES of lethal PC appeared suitable to meet design and feasibility
requirements of a prospective 4 to 6 years clinical trial, which is essential
for regulatory approval of diagnostic and prognostic tests in clinical setting.
Prospectively validated GES of lethal PC in biopsy specimens of G6 and G7
tumors will help physicians to identify, at the time of diagnosis, patients who
should be considered for exclusion from active surveillance programs and who
would most likely benefit from immediate curative interventions.

animal-borne sensors is challenging. Biologists require methods to objectively
quantify baseline behaviour, then assess behaviour changes in response to
environmental stimuli. Here, we apply hidden Markov models (HMMs) to
characterize blue whale movement and diving behaviour, identifying latent
states corresponding to three main underlying behaviour states: shallow
feeding, travelling, and deep feeding. The model formulation accounts for
inter-whale differences via a computationally efficient discrete random effect,
and measures potential effects of experimental acoustic disturbance on
between-state transition probabilities. We identify clear differences in blue
whale disturbance response depending on the behavioural context during
exposure, with whales less likely to initiate deep foraging behaviour during
exposure. Findings are consistent with earlier studies using smaller samples,
but the HMM approach provides more nuanced characterization of behaviour
changes.

non-treated crops, slightly treated crops and conventionally treated crops) on
the effectiveness of pest biocontrol. Effectiveness is measured through
environmental and agronomical descriptors, measuring respectively the impact of
the pesticides on the environment and the average agronomic productivity of the
whole landscape taking into account losses caused by pests.
  Conclusions: The effectiveness of the pesticide, the intensity of the
treatment and the pest intrinsic growth rate are found to be the main drivers
of landscape productivity. The loss in productivity due to a reduced use of
pesticide can be partly compensated by biocontrol. However, the model suggests
that it is not possible to maintain a constant level of productivity while
reducing the use of pesticides, even with highly efficient natural enemies.
Fragmentation of the semi-natural habitats and increased crop rotation tend to
slightly enhance the effectiveness of biocontrol but have a marginal effect
compared to the predation rate by natural enemies.

1602.06591	q-bio	q-bio.MN	Systematic Target Function Annotation of Human Transcription Factors	"  Transcription factors (TFs), the key players in transcriptional regulation,
have attracted great experimental attention, yet the functions of most human
TFs remain poorly understood. Recent capabilities in genome-wide protein
binding profiling have stimulated systematic studies of the hierarchical
organization of human gene regulatory network and DNA-binding specificity of
TFs, shedding light on combinatorial gene regulation. We show here that these
data also enable a systematic annotation of the biological functions and
functional diversity of TFs. We compiled a human gene regulatory network for
384 TFs covering the 146,096 TF-target gene relationships, extracted from over
850 ChIP-seq experiments as well as the literature. By integrating this network
of TF-TF and TF-target gene relationships with 3,715 functional concepts from
six sources of gene function annotations, we obtained over 9,000 confident
functional annotations for 279 TFs. We observe extensive connectivity between
transcription factors and Mendelian diseases, GWAS phenotypes, and
pharmacogenetic pathways. Further, we show that transcription factors link
apparently unrelated functions, even when the two functions do not share common
genes. Finally, we analyze the pleiotropic functions of TFs and suggest that
increased number of upstream regulators contributes to the functional
pleiotropy of TFs. Our computational approach is complementary to focused
experimental studies on TF functions, and the resulting knowledge can guide
experimental design for discovering the unknown roles of TFs in human disease
and drug response.

  transition"	"  A network of neurons in the central nervous system collectively represents
information by its spiking activity states. Typically observed states, i.e.,
codewords, occupy only a limited portion of the state space due to constraints
imposed by network interactions. Geometrical organization of codewords in the
state space, critical for neural information processing, is poorly understood
due to its high dimensionality. Here, we explore the organization of neural
codewords using retinal data by computing the entropy of codewords as a
function of Hamming distance from a particular reference codeword.
Specifically, we report that the retinal codewords in the state space are
divided into multiple distinct clusters separated by entropy-gaps, and that
this structure is shared with well-known associative memory networks in a
recallable phase. Our analysis also elucidates a special nature of the
all-silent state. The all-silent state is surrounded by the densest cluster of
codewords and located within a reachable distance from most codewords. This
codeword-space structure quantitatively predicts typical deviation of a
state-trajectory from its initial state. Altogether, our findings reveal a
non-trivial heterogeneous structure of the codeword-space that shapes
information representation in a biological network.

effects of the Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) and noise. Popular methods for
image restoration include `phase flipping', which corrects only for the Fourier
phases but not amplitudes, and Wiener filtering, which requires the spectral
signal to noise ratio. We propose a new image restoration method which we call
`Covariance Wiener Filtering' (CWF). In CWF, the covariance matrix of the
projection images is used within the classical Wiener filtering framework for
solving the image restoration deconvolution problem. Our estimation procedure
for the covariance matrix is new and successfully corrects for the CTF. We
demonstrate the efficacy of CWF by applying it to restore both simulated and
experimental cryo-EM images. Results with experimental datasets demonstrate
that CWF provides a good way to evaluate the particle images and to see what
the dataset contains even without 2D classification and averaging.

ecosystems as complex networks. A suitable example is parasite spreading:
several parasites may be transmitted among their hosts through different
mechanisms, each one giving rise to a network of interactions. Modelling these
networked, ecological interactions at the same time is still an open challenge.
We present a novel spatially-embedded multiplex network framework for modelling
multi-host infection spreading through multiple routes of transmission. Our
model is inspired by T. cruzi, a parasite transmitted by trophic and vectorial
mechanisms. Our ecological network model is represented by a multiplex in which
nodes represent species populations interacting through a food web and a
parasite contaminative layer at the same time. We modelled an SI dynamics in
two different scenarios: a simple theoretical food web and an empirical one.
Our simulations in both scenarios show that the infection is more widespread
when both the trophic and the contaminative interactions are considered with
equal rates. This indicates that trophic and contaminative transmission may
have additive effects in real ecosystems. We also find that the ratio of
vectors-to-host in the community (i) crucially influences the infection spread,
(ii) regulates a percolating phase transition in the rate of parasite
transmission and (iii) increases the infection rate in hosts. By immunising the
same fractions of predator and prey populations, we show that the multiplex
topology is fundamental in outlining the role that each host species plays in
parasite transmission in a given ecosystem. We also show that the multiplex
models provide a richer phenomenology in terms of parasite spreading dynamics
compared to mono-layer models. Our work opens new challenges and provides new
quantitative tools for modelling multi-channel spreading in networked systems.

1602.06827	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Lagged and instantaneous dynamical influences related to brain
  structural connectivity"	"  Contemporary neuroimaging methods can shed light on the basis of human neural
and cognitive specializations, with important implications for neuroscience and
medicine. Different MRI acquisitions provide different brain networks at the
macroscale; whilst diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) provides a structural
connectivity (SC) coincident with the bundles of parallel fibers between brain
areas, functional MRI (fMRI) accounts for the variations in the
blood-oxygenation-level-dependent T2* signal, providing functional connectivity
(FC).Understanding the precise relation between FC and SC, that is, between
brain dynamics and structure, is still a challenge for neuroscience. To
investigate this problem, we acquired data at rest and built the corresponding
SC (with matrix elements corresponding to the fiber number between brain areas)
to be compared with FC connectivity matrices obtained by 3 different methods:
directed dependencies by an exploratory version of structural equation modeling
(eSEM), linear correlations (C) and partial correlations (PC). We also
considered the possibility of using lagged correlations in time series; so, we
compared a lagged version of eSEM and Granger causality (GC). Our results were
two-fold: firstly, eSEM performance in correlating with SC was comparable to
those obtained from C and PC, but eSEM (not C nor PC) provides information
about directionality of the functional interactions. Second, interactions on a
time scale much smaller than the sampling time, captured by instantaneous
connectivity methods, are much more related to SC than slow directed influences
captured by the lagged analysis. Indeed the performance in correlating with SC
was much worse for GC and for the lagged version of eSEM. We expect these
results to supply further insights to the interplay between SC and functional
patterns, an important issue in the study of brain physiology and function.

density [Phys. Rev. E 90, 062716 (2014)]. Here we solve the stochastic model,

1602.06981	q-bio	q-bio.TO	Mathematical control theory, the immune system, and cancer	"  Simple ideas, endowed from the mathematical theory of control, are used in
order to analyze in general grounds the human immune system. The general
principles are minimization of the pathogen load and economy of resources. They
should constrain the parameters describing the immune system. In the simplest
linear model, for example, where the response is proportional to the load, the
annihilation rate of pathogens in any tissue should be greater than the
pathogen's average rate of growth. When nonlinearities are added, a reference
value for the number of pathogens is set, and a stability condition emerges,
which relates strength of regular threats, barrier height and annihilation
rate. The stability condition allows a qualitative comparison between tissues.
On the other hand, in cancer immunity, the linear model leads to an expression
for the lifetime risk, which accounts for both the effects of carcinogens
(endogenous or external) and the immune response.

1602.07033	q-bio	math.AP math.NA q-bio.PE	"A numerical framework for computing steady states of size-structured
  population models and their stability"	"  Structured population models are a class of general evolution equations which
are widely used in the study of biological systems. Many theoretical methods
are available for establishing existence and stability of steady states of
general evolution equations. However, except for very special cases, finding an
analytical form of stationary solutions for evolution equations is a
challenging task. In the present paper, we develop a numerical framework for
computing approximations to stationary solutions of general evolution
equations, which can also be used to produce existence and stability regions
for steady states. In particular, we use the Trotter-Kato Theorem to
approximate the infinitesimal generator of an evolution equation on a finite
dimensional space, which in turn reduces the evolution equation into a system
of ordinary differential equations. Consequently, we approximate and study the
asymptotic behavior of stationary solutions. We illustrate the convergence of
our numerical framework by applying it to a linear Sinko-Streifer structured
population model for which the exact form of the steady state is known. To
further illustrate the utility of our approach, we apply our framework to
nonlinear population balance equation, which is an extension of well-known
Smoluchowksi coagulation-fragmentation model to biological populations. We also
demonstrate that our numerical framework can be used to gain insight about the
theoretical stability of the stationary solutions of the evolution equations.
Furthermore, the open source Python program that we have developed for our
numerical simulations is freely available from our Github repository
(github.com/MathBioCU).

1602.07103	q-bio	q-bio.GN	Visualizing Gene Ontology annotations	"  Contemporary techniques in biology produce readouts for large numbers of
genes simultaneously, the typical example being differential gene expression
measurements. Moreover, those genes are often richly annotated using GO terms
that describe gene function and that can be used to summarize the results of
the genome-scale experiments. However, making sense of such GO enrichment
analyses may be challenging. For instance, overrepresented GO functions in a
set of differentially expressed genes are typically output as a flat list, a
format not adequate to capture the complexities of the hierarchical structure
of the GO annotation labels.
  In this chapter, we survey the various methods to visualize large,
difficult-to-interpret lists of GO terms. We catalogue their availability
(web-based or standalone), the main principles they employ in summarizing large
lists of GO terms, and the visualization styles they support. These brief
commentaries on each software are intended as a helpful inventory, rather than
comprehensive descriptions of the underlying algorithms. Instead, we show
examples of their use and suggest that the choice of an appropriate
visualization tool may be crucial to the utility of GO in biological discovery.

biochemistry providing information on size, shape, and interactions of
macromolecules from the analysis of their migration in centrifugal fields while
free in solution. A key mechanical element in AUC is the centerpiece, a
component of the sample cell assembly that is mounted between the optical
windows to allow imaging and to seal the sample solution column against high
vacuum while exposed to gravitational forces in excess of 300,000 g. For
sedimentation velocity it needs to be precisely sector-shaped to allow
unimpeded radial macromolecular migration. During the history of AUC a great
variety of centerpiece designs have been developed for different types of
experiments. Here, we report that centerpieces can now be readily fabricated by
3D printing at low cost, from a variety of materials, and with customized
designs. The new centerpieces can exhibit sufficient mechanical stability to
withstand the gravitational forces at the highest rotor speeds and be
sufficiently precise for sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity
experiments. Sedimentation velocity experiments with bovine serum albumin as a
reference molecule in 3D printed centerpieces with standard double-sector
design result in sedimentation boundaries virtually indistinguishable from
those in commercial double-sector epoxy centerpieces, with sedimentation
coefficients well within the range of published values. The statistical error
of the measurement is slightly above that obtained with commercial epoxy, but
still below 1%. Facilitated by modern open-source design and fabrication
paradigms, we believe 3D printed centerpieces and AUC accessories can spawn a
variety of improvements in AUC experimental design, efficiency and resource
allocation.

  occupancy amino acid electron density evidence"	"  A re-refinement of 4xan, hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) with carboplatin
crystallised in NaBr solution, has been made (Tanley et al 2016). This follows
our Response article (Tanley et al 2015) to the Critique article of Shabalin et
al 2015, suggesting the need for corrections to some solute molecule
interpretations of electron density in 4xan and removal of an organic moiety as
a ligand to the platinum ion coordinated to His15. We note Shabalin et al
(2015) model of a chlorine in that density and a close by bromine at partial
occupancy to explain the shape. However, as the bromide concentration is in
huge excess over chloride (by 20 fold), we think that the 4yem Shabalin et al
2015 interpretation highly unlikely, but nevertheless we still cannot offer an
explanation for that shape, confirming our earlier analysis described in Tanley
et al (2014). Following Shabalin et al (2015) reprocessing of the raw
diffraction data for 4g4a, we also redid the diffraction data processing for
4xan to a higher resolution using EVAL (Schreurs et al 2010) concluding in
favour of 1.3 Angstrom as the resolution limit and which is the basis for our
revised PDB file for 4xan (5HMJ). It is very interesting that there is extra
X-ray diffraction data from 1.47 to 1.30 Angstrom resolution e.g. with
<I/sigma(I)> =0.39 and CC1/2 = 0.181 in the final shell (1.30 to 1.322
Angstrom). In this arXiv article we document in detail our different solvent
and split occupancy side chain electron density interpretations as evidence for
our statement of approach in our Response article (Tanley et al 2015). Our
critical re-examination includes comparisons based on the 4xan diffraction data
images reprocessing with three different software packages so as to evaluate
the possibility of variations in electron density interpretations due to that.
Overall our finalised model (PDB code 5HMJ) is now improved over 4xan.

  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease exemplify shortcomings in methods used to evaluate
  therapies in rare conditions"	"  BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard design
of clinical research to assess interventions. However, RCTs cannot always be
applied for practical or ethical reasons. To investigate the current practices
in rare diseases, we review evaluations of therapeutic interventions in
paediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). In
particular, we shed light on the endpoints used, the study designs implemented
and the statistical methodologies applied.
  METHODS: We conducted literature searches to identify relevant primary
studies. Data on study design, objectives, endpoints, patient characteristics,
randomization and masking, type of intervention, control, withdrawals and
statistical methodology were extracted from the selected studies. The risk of
bias and the quality of the studies were assessed.
  RESULTS: Twelve (seven) primary studies on paediatric MS (CJD) were included
in the qualitative synthesis. No double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled
trial for evaluating interventions in paediatric MS has been published yet.
Evidence from one open-label RCT is available. The observational studies are
before-after studies or controlled studies. Three of the seven selected studies
on CJD are RCTs, of which two received the maximum mark on the Oxford Quality
Scale. Four trials are controlled observational studies.
  CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from double-blind RCTs on the efficacy of treatments
appears to be variable between rare diseases. With regard to paediatric
conditions it remains to be seen what impact regulators will have through e.g.,
paediatric investigation plans. Overall, there is space for improvement by
using innovative trial designs and data analysis techniques.

  Extremes, Disturbance, and Forest Stand Dynamics"	"  Changes in the frequency, duration, and severity of climate extremes are
forecast to occur under global climate change. The impacts of climate extremes
on forest productivity and health are complicated by potential interactions
with disturbance events and stand dynamics. The effects of stand dynamics on
forest responses to climate and disturbance are particularly important given
forest characteristics driven by stand dynamics can be modified through forest
management with the goal of increasing forest resistance and resilience to
climate change. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian state-space model allowing
climate effects on tree growth to vary over time and in relation to climate
extremes, disturbance events, and stand dynamics. We apply the model to a
dendrochronology dataset comprising measurements from forest stands of varying
composition, structure, and development stage in northeastern Minnesota.
Results indicate average forest growth was most sensitive to variables
describing climatic water deficit. Forest growth responses to water deficit
were partitioned into responses driven by climatic threshold exceedances and
interactions with forest tent caterpillar defoliation. Forest growth was both
resistant and resilient to climate extremes with the majority of forest growth
responses occurring after multiple climatic threshold exceedances or insect
defoliation events. Forest growth was most sensitive to water deficit during
periods of high stem density following major regeneration events when average
inter-tree competition was high. Results suggest that forest growth resistance
and resilience to interactions between climate extremes and insect defoliation
can be increased through management steps such as thinning to reduce
competition during early stages of stand development and small-group selection
harvests to maintain forest structures characteristic of older, mature stands.

1602.07266	q-bio	q-bio.GN	"Supra-operonic clusters of functionally related genes (SOCs) are a
  source of horizontal gene co-transfers"	"  Adaptation of bacteria occurs predominantly via horizontal gene transfer
(HGT). While it is widely recognized that horizontal acquisitions frequently
encompass multiple genes, it is unclear what the size distribution of
successfully transferred DNA segments looks like and what evolutionary forces
shape this distribution. Here, we identified 1790 gene family pairs that were
consistently co-gained on the same branches across a phylogeny of 53 E. coli
strains. We estimated a lower limit of their genomic distances at the time they
were transferred to their host genomes; this distribution shows a sharp upper
bound at 30 kb. The same gene-pairs can have larger distances (up to 70 kb) in
other genomes. These more distant pairs likely represent recent acquisitions
via transduction that involve the co-transfer of excised prophage genes, as
they are almost always associated with intervening phage-associated genes. The
observed distribution of genomic distances of co-transferred genes is much
broader than expected from a model based on the co-transfer of genes within
operons; instead, this distribution is highly consistent with the size
distribution of supra-operonic clusters (SOCs), groups of co-occurring and
co-functioning genes that extend beyond operons. Thus, we propose that SOCs
form a basic unit of horizontal gene transfer.

1602.07311	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Selective activation of resting state networks following focal
  stimulation in a connectome- based network model of the human brain"	"  Imaging studies suggest that the functional connectivity patterns of resting
state networks (RS-networks) reflect underlying structural connectivity (SC).
If the connectome constrains how brain areas are functionally connected, the
stimulation of specific brain areas should produce a characteristic wave of
activity ultimately resolving into RS-networks. To systematically test this
hypothesis, we use a connectome-based network model of the human brain with
detailed realistic SC. We systematically activate all possible thalamic and
cortical areas with focal stimulation patterns and confirm that the stimulation
of specific areas evokes network patterns that closely resemble RS-networks.
For some sites, one or no RS-network is engaged, whereas for other sites more
than one RS-network may evolve. Our results confirm that the brain is operating
at the edge of criticality, wherein stimulation produces a cascade of
functional network recruitments, collapsing onto a smaller subspace that is
constrained in part by the anatomical local and long-range SCs. We suggest that
information flow, and subsequent cognitive processing, follows specific routes
imposed by connectome features, and that these routes explain the emergence of
RS-networks. Since brain stimulation can be used to diagnose/treat neurological
disorders, we provide a look-up table showing which areas need to be stimulated
to activate specific RS-networks.

the youngest of the transposable elements in the human genome. The propagation
of the most ancient SVA type A took place about thirteen millions years ago
ago, and the youngest SVA types appeared in the human genome after the
chimpanzee divergence. Functional enrichment analysis of genes associated with
SVA insertions demonstrated their strong link to multiple ontological
categories attributed to brain function and the disorders. SVA types that
expanded their presence in the human genome at different stages of hominoid
life history were also associated with progressively evolving behavioural
features that indicated a potential impact of SVA propagation on a cognitive
ability of a modern human. The SVA-associated genes were highly cross-linked in
functional networks suggesting an accumulative impact of functional alterations
potentially caused by SVA insertions. Our analysis uncovered a potential role
of SVAs in evolution of human CNS and especially emergence of functional trends
relevant to social and parental behaviour. It also supports models which
explain in part how brain function can be modulated by both the immune and
reproductive systems based on the gene expression patterns and gene pathways
potentially altered by SVA insertions.

the dimensionality of the model from exponential in the number of extant taxa,
to quadratic in the number of taxa, while retaining the ability to
statistically identify phylogenetic divergence events. A key feature is the

not be closely related to each other, there can be distant (cryptic)
relationships that confound the evidence of disease association. These cryptic
relationships violate the GWAS assumption regarding the independence of the
subjects' genomes, and failure to account for these relationships results in
both false positives and false negatives.
  This paper presents a method to correct for these cryptic relationships. We
accurately detect distant relationships using an expectation maximization (EM)
algorithm for finding the identity coefficients from genotype data with know
prior knowledge of relationships. From the identity coefficients we compute the
kinship coefficients and employ a kinship-corrected association test.
  We assess the accuracy of our EM kinship estimation algorithm. We show that
on genomes simulated from a Wright-Fisher pedigree, our method converges
quickly and requires only a relatively small number of sites to be accurate. We
also demonstrate that our kinship coefficient estimates outperform
state-of-the-art covariance-based approaches and PLINK's kinship estimate.
  To assess the kinship-corrected association test, we simulated individuals
from deep pedigrees and drew one site to recessively determine the disease
status. We applied our EM algorithm to estimate the kinship coefficients and
ran a kinship-adjusted association test. Our approach compares favorably with
the state-of-the-art and far out-performs a na\""ive association test.
  We advocate use of our method to detect cryptic relationships and for
correcting association tests. Not only is our model easy to interpret due to
the use of identity states as latent variables, but also inference provides
state-of-the-art accuracy.

efficiency of FO-TPOS as compared to conventional single-photon beam was

becomes even more challenging if the study is to be limited to specific cells
within a larger population, since other transfection methods, such as viral
transfection and lipofection, are not realizable with a high degree of spatial
selectivity.Here, we have used a focused femtosecond laser beam to create a
small transient hole in the cellular membrane (optoporation) in order to inject
nanomolar concentrations of rhodamine phalloidin (an impermeable dye molecule
for staining filamentous actin) into targeted living mammalian cells (both HEK
and primary cortical neurons).Following optoporation, the bound to the
intracellular actin network and rise in fluorescence intensity was observed...

1602.08079	q-bio	q-bio.BM	Spherical Distance Metrics Applied to Protein Structure Classification	"  Structural relationships among proteins are important in the study of their
evolution as well as in drug design and development. The protein 3D structure
has been shown to be effective with respect to classifying proteins. Prior work
has shown that the Double Centroid Reduced Representation (DCRR) model is a
useful geometric representation for protein structure with respect to visual
models, reducing the quantity of modeled information for each amino acid, yet
retaining the most important geometrical and chemical features of each: the
centroids of the backbone and of the side-chain. DCRR has not yet been applied
in the calculation of geometric structural similarity. Meanwhile,
multi-dimensional indexing (MDI) of protein structure combines protein
structural analysis with distance metrics to facilitate structural similarity
queries and is also used for clustering protein structures into related groups.
In this respect, the combination of geometric models with MDI has been shown to
be effective. Prior work, notably Distance and Density based Protein Indexing
(DDPIn), applies MDI to protein models based on the geometry of the CA
backbone. DDPIn distance metrics are based on radial and density functions that
incorporate spherical-based metrics, and the indices are built from metric tree
(M-tree) structures. This work combines DCRR with DDPIn for the development of
new DCRR centroid-based metrics: spherical binning distance and inter-centroid
spherical distance. The use of DCRR models will provide additional significant
structural information via the inclusion of side-chain centroids. Additionally,
the newly developed distance metric functions combined with DCRR and M-tree
indexing attempt to improve upon the performance of prior work (DDPIn), given
the same data set, with respect to both individual k-nearest neighbor (kNN)
search queries as well as clustering all proteins in the index.

1602.08111	q-bio	q-bio.BM q-bio.TO	A Cancer Biotherapy Resource	"  Cancer Biotherapy (CB), as opposed to cancer chemotherapy, is the use of
macromolecular, biological agents instead of organic chemicals or drugs to
treat cancer. Biological agents usually have higher selectivity and have less
toxic side effects than chemical agents. The I.S.B.T.C., being the only major
information database for CB, seems lacking in some crucial information on
various cancer biotherapy regimens. It is thus necessary to have a
comprehensive curated CB database. The database accessible to cancer patients
and also should be a sounding board for scientific ideas by cancer researchers.
The database/web server has information about main families of cancer
biotherapy regimens to date, namely, Protein Kinase Inhibitors, Ras Pathway
Inhibitors, Cell-Cycle Active Agents, MAbs (monoclonal antibodies), ADEPT
(Antibody-Directed Enzyme Pro-Drug Therapy), Cytokines, Anti-Angiogenesis
Agents, Cancer Vaccines, Cell-based Immunotherapeutics, Gene Therapy,
Hematopoietic Growth Factors, Retinoids, and CAAT. For each biotherapy regimen,
we will extract the following attributes in populating the database: Cancer
type, Gene/s and gene product/s involved, Gene sequence, Organs affected,
Reference papers, Clinical phase/stage, Survival rate, Clinical test center
locations, Cost, Patient blogs, Researcher blogs, and Future work. The database
will be accessible to public through a website and had FAQs for making it
understandable to the laymen and discussion page for researchers to express
their views and ideas. In addition to information about the biotherapy
regimens, the website will link to other biologically significant databases
like structural proteomics, metabolomics, glycomics, and lipidomics databases,
as well as to news around the world regarding cancer therapy results. The
database attributes would be regularly updated for novel attributes as
discoveries are made.

1602.08113	q-bio	q-bio.BM	Representing Rod-Shaped Protein 3D Structures in Cylindrical Coordinates	"  Based on overall 3D structure, proteins may be grouped into two broad
categories, namely, globular proteins (spheroproteins), and elongated or
rod-shaped proteins (RSP). The former comprises a significant majority of
proteins. This work concerns the second category. Unlike a spheroprotein, an
RSP possesses a conspicuous axis along its longest dimension. To take advantage
of this symmetry element, we decided to represent RSPs using cylindrical
coordinates, (rho, theta, z), with the z-axis as the main axis, and one tip of
the protein at the origin. A ""tip"" is one of two extreme points in the protein
lying along the protein axis along its longest dimension. We first identify the
two tips, T1 and T2, of the RSP using a protein graphics software, then
determine their (Cartesian) coordinates, (h, k, l) and (m, n, o), respectively.
Arbitrarily selecting T1 as the tip at the origin, we translate the protein by
subtracting (h, k, l) from all structural coordinates. We then find the angle
alpha between vector T1-T2 and the positive z-axis by computing the scalar
product of vectors T1- T2 and OP where P is an arbitrary point along the
positive z-axis. We typically use (0, 0, p) where p is a suitable positive
number. Then we compute the cross product of the two vectors to determine the
axis about which we should rotate vector T1-T2 to make it coincide with the
positive z-axis. We use a matrix form of Rodrigues' formula to do the rotation.
We then apply the Cartesian to cylindrical coordinate transformation equations
to the system. We have applied the above transformation to 15 RSPs: 1QCE, 2JJ7,
2KPE, 3K2A, 3LHP, 2LOE, 2L3H, 2L1P, 1KSG, 1KSJ, 1KSH, 2KOL, 2KZG, 2KPF and
3MQC. We have also created a web server that can take the PDB coordinate file
of an RSP and output its cylindrical coordinates. The URL of our web server

1602.08115	q-bio	q-bio.BM	"Size-Independent Quantification of Ligand Binding Site Depth in Receptor
  Proteins"	"  We have developed a web server that implements two complementary methods to
quantify the depth of ligand binding site (LBS) in protein-ligand complexes:
the ""secant plane"" (SP) and ""tangent sphere"" (TS) methods. The protein
molecular centroid (global centroid, GC), and the LBS centroid (local centroid,
LC) are first determined. The SP is the plane passing through the LC and normal
to the line passing through the LC and the GC. The ""exterior side"" of the SP is
the side opposite GC. The TS is the sphere with center at GC and tangent to the
SP at LC. The percentage of protein atoms inside the TS (TS index) and on the
exterior side of the SP (SP index), are complementary measures of LBS depth.
The SPi is directly proportional to LBS depth while the TSi is inversely
proportional. We tested the two methods using a test set of 67
well-characterized protein-ligand structures (Laskowski, et al. 1996), as well
as that of an artificial protein in the form of a grid of points in the overall
shape of a sphere and in which LBS of any depth can be specified. Results from
both the SP and TS methods agree well with reported data (ibid.), and results
from the artificial case confirm that both methods are suitable measures of LBS
depth. The web server may be used in two modes. In the ""ligand mode"", user
inputs the protein PDB coordinates as well as those of the ligand. The ""LBS
mode"" is the same as the former, except that the ligand coordinates are assumed
to be unavailable; hence the user inputs what s/he believes to be the
coordinates of the LBS amino acid residues. In both cases, the web server
outputs the SP and TS indices. LBS depth is usually directly related to the
amount of conformational change a protein undergoes upon ligand binding -
ability to quantify it could allows meaningful comparison of protein
flexibility and dynamics. The URL of our web server will be announced publicly
in due course.

1602.08117	q-bio	q-bio.BM	"Visualization of Protein 3D Structures in Reduced Representation with
  Simultaneous Display of Intra- and Inter-Molecular Interactions"	"  Protein structure representation is an important tool in structural biology.
There exists different methods of representing the protein 3D structures and
different biologists favor different methods based on the information they
require. Currently there is no available method of protein 3D structure
representation which captures enough chemical information from the protein
sequence and clearly shows the intra-molecular and the inter-molecular H-bonds
and VDW interactions at the same time. This project aims to reduce the 3D
structure of a protein and display the reduced representation along with
intermolecular and the intra- molecular H-bonds and van der Waals interactions.
A reduced protein representation has a significantly lower atomicity (i.e.,
number of atom coordinates) than one which is in all- atom representation. In
this work, we transform the protein structure from all-atom representation""
(AAR) to double-centroid reduced representation (DCRR), which contains amino
acid backbone (N, CA, C', O) and side chain (CB and beyond) centroid
coordinates instead of atomic coordinates. Another aim of this project is to
develop a visualization interface for the reduced representation. This
interface is implemented in MATLAB and displays the protein in DCRR along with
its inter-molecular, as well as intra-molecular, interaction. Visually, DCRR is
easier to comprehend than AAR. We also developed a Web Server called the
Protein DCRR Web Server wherein users can enter the PDB id or upload a modeled
protein and get the DCRR of that protein. The back end to the Web Server is a
database which has the reduced representation for all the x-ray
crystallographic structure in the PDB.

  Using the 3D Search Motif Method and Double-Centroid Reduced Representation
  of Protein 3D Structures"	"  A pharmacophore consists of the parts of the structure of the ligand that are
sufficient to express the biological and pharmacological effects of the ligand.
It is usually a substructure of the entire structure of the ligand. Small
organic molecules called ligands or metabolites in the cell form complexes with
biomolecules (usually proteins) to serve different purposes. The sites at which
the ligands bind are known as ligand binding sites, which are essentially
""pockets"" which have complementary shapes and patterns of charge distribution
with the ligands. Sometimes a pocket is induced by the ligand itself. If we
study different bound conformations of ligands it is found that they share a
specific three- dimensional pattern that is more or less common and is
responsible for its binding and which is complementary in three-dimensional
geometry and charge distribution pattern with its cognate binding site in the
protein. This work studies the three dimensional structure of the consensus
ligand binding site for the ligand FMN. A training set for the ligand binding
sites was made and a 3D consensus binding site motif was determined for FMN.
The FMN system was studied and its binding sites in its respective regulator
proteins. The ability to identify ligand binding site by scanning the 3D
binding site consensus motif in protein 3D structures is an important step in
drug target discovery. Once a pharmacophore template is found it can also be
used to design other potential molecules that can bind to it and thus serve as
novel drugs.

1602.08183	q-bio	q-bio.QM q-bio.PE	Non-Identifiable Pedigrees and a Bayesian Solution	"  Some methods aim to correct or test for relationships or to reconstruct the
pedigree, or family tree. We show that these methods cannot resolve ties for
correct relationships due to identifiability of the pedigree likelihood which
is the probability of inheriting the data under the pedigree model. This means
that no likelihood-based method can produce a correct pedigree inference with
high probability. This lack of reliability is critical both for health and
forensics applications.
  In this paper we present the first discussion of multiple typed individuals
in non-isomorphic pedigrees, $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$, where the
likelihoods are non-identifiable, $Pr[G~|~\mathcal{P},\theta] =
Pr[G~|~\mathcal{Q},\theta]$, for all input data $G$ and all recombination rate
parameters $\theta$. While there were previously known non-identifiable pairs,
we give an example having data for multiple individuals.
  Additionally, deeper understanding of the general discrete structures driving
these non-identifiability examples has been provided, as well as results to
guide algorithms that wish to examine only identifiable pedigrees. This paper
introduces a general criteria for establishing whether a pair of pedigrees is
non-identifiable and two easy-to-compute criteria guaranteeing identifiability.
Finally, we suggest a method for dealing with non-identifiable likelihoods: use
Bayes rule to obtain the posterior from the likelihood and prior. We propose a
prior guaranteeing that the posterior distinguishes all pairs of pedigrees.

interval, such that $\{f\ge \varepsilon\}$ is finite for any $\varepsilon$. A
comb induces a (pseudo)-distance $\dtf$ on $\{f=0\}$ defined by $\dtf(s,t) =
\max_{(s\wedge t, s\vee t)} f$. We describe the completion $\bar I$ of
$\{f=0\}$ for this metric, which is a compact ultrametric space called
\emph{comb metric space}.
  Conversely, we prove that any compact, ultrametric space $(U,d)$ without
isolated points is isometric to a comb metric space. We show various examples
of the comb representation of well-known ultrametric spaces: the Kingman
coalescent, infinite sequences of a finite alphabet, the $p$-adic field and
spheres of locally compact real trees. In particular, for a rooted, locally
compact real tree defined from its contour process $h$, the comb isometric to
the sphere of radius $T$ centered at the root can be extracted from $h$ as the
depths of its excursions away from $T$.

  Orthologs, Paralogs, and Xenologs"	"  Phylogenetic reconstruction aims at finding plausible hypotheses of the
evolutionary history of genes or species based on genomic sequence information.
The distinction of orthologous genes (genes that having a common ancestry and
diverged after a speciation) is crucial and lies at the heart of many genomic
studies. However, existing methods that rely only on 1:1 orthologs to infer
species trees are strongly restricted to a small set of allowed genes that
provide information about the species tree. The use of larger gene sets that
consist in addition of non-orthologous genes (e.g. so-called paralogous or
xenologous genes) considerably increases the information about the evolutionary
history of the respective species. In this work, we introduce a novel method to
compute species phylogenies based on sequence data including orthologs,
paralogs or even xenologs.

properties not only reveals crucial differences in each PPI layer but also
indicates the presence of the varying complexity among them. The PPI layer of
Nematode life stage exhibits various network properties different to rest of
the PPI layers, indicating the specific role of cellular diversity and
developmental transitions at this stage. The framework presented here provides

stable continuous-state branching processes, given by another Lamperti time

present a mixed-integer linear programming framework capable of determining
whether a given mass action system has a dynamically equivalent or linearly

linearly conjugate systems which are weakly reversible and have a deficiency of

having low dimensional data to be justified by a linear model defined in a high
dimensional parameter space. The difference in dimensionality makes the problem
ill-defined: the model is consistent with the data for many values of its
parameters. The objective is to find the probability distribution of parameter
values consistent with the data, a problem that can be cast as the exploration
of a high dimensional convex polytope. In this work we introduce a novel
algorithm to solve this problem efficiently. It provides results that are
statistically indistinguishable from currently used numerical techniques while
its running time scales linearly with the system size. We show that the
algorithm performs robustly in many abstract and practical applications. As
working examples we simulate the effects of restricting reaction fluxes on the
space of feasible phenotypes of a {\em genome} scale E. Coli metabolic network

memory that is both predictive and simple. The TBRS is the mainstream
decay-based model and the most susceptible to competition with
interference-based models. A connectionist implementation of the TBRS, the
TBRS*, has recently been developed. However, the TBRS* is an enriched version
of the TBRS, making it difficult to test the general characteristics resulting
from the TBRS assumptions. Here, we describe a novel model, the TBRS2, built to
be more transparent and simple than the TBRS*. The TBRS2 is minimalist and
allows only a few parameters. It is a straightforward mathematical
transcription of the TBRS that focuses exclusively on the activation level of
memory items as a function of time. Its simplicity makes it possible to derive
several theorems from the original TBRS and allows several variants of the

adaptive networks of arbitrary topology. We focus our study on the adaptive
susceptible-infected-susceptible (ASIS) model, where healthy individuals are
allowed to temporarily cut edges connecting them to infected nodes in order to
prevent the spread of the infection. In this paper, we derive a closed-form
expression for a lower bound on the epidemic threshold of the ASIS model in
arbitrary networks with heterogeneous node and edge dynamics. For networks with
homogeneous node and edge dynamics, we show that the resulting \blue{lower
bound} is proportional to the epidemic threshold of the standard SIS model over
static networks, with a proportionality constant that depends on the adaptation
rates. Furthermore, based on our results, we propose an efficient algorithm to
optimally tune the adaptation rates in order to eradicate epidemic outbreaks in
arbitrary networks. We confirm the tightness of the proposed lower bounds with
several numerical simulations and compare our optimal adaptation rates with
popular centrality measures.

We present a model of retinal coding that is based on three constraints:
information preservation, minimization of the neural wiring, and response
equalization. The resulting novel version of sparse principal components
analysis successfully captures a number of known characteristics of the retinal
coding system, such as center-surround receptive fields, color opponency
channels, and spatiotemporal responses that correspond to magnocellular and
parvocellular pathways. Furthermore, when trained on auditory data, the same
model learns receptive fields well fit by gammatone filters, commonly used to

Communication among cells is a primary means for cells to interact with each

  transmission"	"  Cells measure concentrations of external ligands by capturing ligand
molecules with cell surface receptors. The numbers of molecules captured by
different receptors co-vary because they depend on the same extrinsic ligand
fluctuations. However, these numbers also counter-vary due to the intrinsic
stochasticity of chemical processes because a single molecule randomly captured
by a receptor cannot be captured by another. Such structure of receptor
correlations is generally believed to lead to an increase in information about
the external signal compared to the case of independent receptors. We analyze a
solvable model of two molecular receptors and show that, contrary to this
widespread expectation, the correlations have a small and negative effect on
the information about the ligand concentration. Further, we show that
measurements that average over multiple receptors are almost as informative as
those that track the states of every individual one.

1602.08568	q-bio	q-bio.MN	"Gene expression noise is affected differentially by feedback in burst
  frequency and burst size"	"  Inside individual cells, expression of genes is stochastic across organisms
ranging from bacterial to human cells. A ubiquitous feature of stochastic
expression is burst-like synthesis of gene products, which drives considerable
intercellular variability in protein levels across an isogenic cell population.
One common mechanism by which cells control such stochasticity is negative
feedback regulation, where a protein inhibits its own synthesis. For a single
gene that is expressed in bursts, negative feedback can affect the burst
frequency or the burst size. In order to compare these feedback types, we study
a piecewise deterministic model for gene expression of a self-regulating gene.
Mathematically tractable steady-state protein distributions are derived and
used to compare the noise suppression abilities of the two feedbacks. Results
show that in the low noise regime, both feedbacks are similar in term of their
noise buffering abilities. Intriguingly, feedback in burst size outperforms the
feedback in burst frequency in the high noise regime. Finally, we discuss
various regulatory strategies by which cells implement feedback to control
burst sizes of expressed proteins at the level of single cells.

general model of motion of substance through a channel containing finite number
of boxes. The model is applied then for case of migrants moving through a
channel consisting of finite number of countries or cities. The number of
migrants in the channel strongly depends on the number of migrants that enter

1602.08678	q-bio	stat.AP q-bio.GN	"Robust hyperparameter estimation protects against hypervariable genes
  and improves power to detect differential expression"	"  One of the most common analysis tasks in genomic research is to identify
genes that are differentially expressed (DE) between experimental conditions.
Empirical Bayes (EB) statistical tests using moderated genewise variances have
been very effective for this purpose, especially when the number of biological
replicate samples is small. The EB procedures can however be heavily influenced
by a small number of genes with very large or very small variances. This
article improves the differential expression tests by robustifying the
hyperparameter estimation procedure. The robust procedure has the effect of
decreasing the informativeness of the prior distribution for outlier genes
while increasing its informativeness for other genes. This effect has the
double benefit of reducing the chance that hypervariable genes will be
spuriously identified as DE while increasing statistical power for the main
body of genes. The robust EB algorithm is fast and numerically stable. The
procedure allows exact small-sample null distributions for the test statistics
and reduces exactly to the original EB procedure when no outlier genes are
present. Simulations show that the robustified tests have similar performance
to the original tests in the absence of outlier genes but have greater power
and robustness when outliers are present. The article includes case studies for
which the robust method correctly identifies and downweights genes associated
with hidden covariates and detects more genes likely to be scientifically
relevant to the experimental conditions. The new procedure is implemented in
the limma software package freely available from the Bioconductor repository.

  biological invasions in heterogeneous landscapes"	"  Classical models of biological invasions assess species spread in homogeneous
landscapes by assuming constant growth rates and random local movement.
Mounting evidence suggests, however, that demographic stochasticity,
environmental heterogeneity and non-random movement of individuals affect
considerably the spread dynamics. Here, we show that the dynamics of biological
invasions are controlled by the spatial heterogeneity of the resource
distribution. We show theoretically that increasing the landscape resource
autocorrelation length causes a reduction in the average speed of species
spread. Demographic stochasticity plays a key role in the slowdown, which is
streghtened when individuals can actively move towards resources. The reduction
in the front propagation speed is verified in laboratory microcosm experiments
with the flagellated protist Euglena gracilis by comparing spread in habitats
characterized by different resource heterogeneity. Our theoretical and
experimental findings highlight the need to account for the intrinsic
stochasticity of population dynamics to describe spread in spatially extended
landscapes, which are inevitably characterized by heterogeneous spatial
distributions of resources controlling vital rates. Our work identifies the
resource autocorrelation length as a key modulator and a simple measure of
landscape susceptibility to biological invasions, with implications for
predicting the characters of biological invasions within naturally
heterogeneous environmental corridors.

demonstrated empirically in bacterial and eukaryotic systems. Such coregulation
can arise through the use of shared regulatory motifs, which allow the
coordinated expression of modules (and module groups) of functionally related

models for transcription factor networks with modular structure (including
module groups, and multi-input modules (MIM) with autoregulation) and
multi-gene complexes (including hierarchical differentiation between multi-gene
complex members). We develop a mean-field approach to analyse the stability of
large networks incorporating coregulation, and show that autoregulated MIM and
hierarchical gene-complex models can achieve greater stability than networks
without coregulation whose rules have matching activation frequency. We provide
further analysis of the stability of small networks of both kinds through
simulations. We also characterize several general properties of the transients
and attractors in the hierarchical coregulation model, and show using
simulations that the steady-state distribution factorizes hierarchically as a
Bayesian network in a Markov Jump Process analogue of the RBN model.

hunts. Eyes on the side, the animal hides."" In this paper, we explore one
possible explanation for why predators tend to have forward-facing, high-acuity
visual systems. We do so using an agent-based computational model of evolution,
where predators and prey interact and adapt their behavior and morphology to
one another over successive generations of evolution. In this model, we observe
a coevolutionary cycle between prey swarming behavior and the predator's visual
system, where the predator and prey continually adapt their visual system and
behavior, respectively, over evolutionary time in reaction to one another due
to the well-known ""predator confusion effect."" Furthermore, we provide evidence
that the predator visual system is what drives this coevolutionary cycle, and
suggest that the cycle could be closed if the predator evolves a hybrid visual
system capable of narrow, high-acuity vision for tracking prey as well as
broad, coarse vision for prey discovery. Thus, the conflicting demands imposed
on a predator's visual system by the predator confusion effect could have led
to the evolution of complex eyes in many predators.

behavior. Internal mechanisms of brain state control are well studied, but the
role of external modulation from the environment is not well understood. Here,
we examined the role of closed-loop environmental (CLE) feedback, in comparison
to open-loop sensory input, on brain state and behavior in diverse vertebrate
systems. In fictively swimming zebrafish, CLE feedback for optomotor stability
controlled brain state by reducing coherent neuronal activity. The role of CLE
feedback in brain state was also shown in a model of rodent active whisking,
where brief interruptions in this feedback enhanced signal-to-noise ratio for
detecting touch. Finally, in monkey visual fixation, artificial CLE feedback
suppressed stimulus-specific neuronal activity and improved behavioral
performance. Our findings show that the environment mediates continuous
closed-loop feedback that controls neuronal gain, regulating brain state, and
that brain function is an emergent property of brain-environment interactions.

1602.08889	q-bio	q-bio.BM	"Folding of Protein L with implications for collapse in the denatured
  state ensemble"	"  A fundamental question in protein folding is whether the coil to globule
collapse transition occurs during the initial stages of folding (burst-phase)
or simultaneously with the protein folding transition. Single molecule
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and small angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS) experiments disagree on whether Protein L collapse transition occurs
during the burst-phase of folding. We study Protein L folding using a
coarse-grained model and molecular dynamics simulations. The collapse
transition in Protein L is found to be concomitant with the folding transition.
In the burst-phase of folding, we find that FRET experiments overestimate
radius of gyration, $R_g$, of the protein due to the application of Gaussian
polymer chain end-to-end distribution to extract $R_g$ from the FRET
efficiency. FRET experiments estimate $\approx$ 6\AA \ decrease in $R_g$ when
the actual decrease is $\approx$ 3\AA \ on Guanidinium Chloride denaturant
dilution from 7.5M to 1M, and thereby suggesting pronounced compaction in the
protein dimensions in the burst-phase. The $\approx$ 3\AA \ decrease is close
to the statistical uncertainties of the $R_g$ data measured from SAXS
experiments, which suggest no compaction, leading to a disagreement with the
FRET experiments. The transition state ensemble (TSE) structures in Protein L
folding are globular and extensive in agreement with the $\Psi$-analysis
experiments. The results support the hypothesis that the TSE of single domain
proteins depend on protein topology, and are not stabilised by local
interactions alone.

1602.08913	q-bio	q-bio.OT	"X-ray experiment provides a way to reveal the distinction between
  discrete and continuous conformation of myosin head"	"  The corner stone of the classical model after Huxley and Simmons is
supposition that a myosin head can reside only in several discrete states and
irregularly jumps from one state to another. Until now, it has not been found a
way to experimentally verify this supposition although confirmation or
refutation of the existence of discrete states is crucial for the solution of
myosin motor problem. Here I show that a set of equal myosin heads arranged
equidistantly along an actin filament produce X-ray pattern which varies with
the type of conformation. If the lever arms of all myosin heads reside in one
and the same position (continuous conformation), all the heads have the same
form-factor and equally scatter electromagnetic wave. In this case, only the
geometric factor associated with a spatial ordering of the heads will determine
the X-ray pattern. The situation changes if the average lever arm position is
the same, but inherently every head can reside only in several diverse discrete
states, hopping irregularly from one to another. In this case, the form-factors
corresponding to distinct states are dissimilar, and the increments in phases
of X-rays scattered by different heads are different as well. Inasmuch as every
quantum of radiation interacts with the heads residing in different states,
this results in additional interference and some peaks in the X-ray pattern
should slacken or even extinct as compared with the pattern from the heads with
the continuous-type conformation. The formulas describing both cases are
compared in this article. In general, the distinction between X-ray patterns is
insignificant, but they could be appreciably different at some stages of
conformation process (respective lever arm position depends on the type of
discrete model). Consequently, one can with luck attempt to find out this
difference using a high-sensitive equipment.

Krebs cycle (or the tricarboxilic acid cycle). For the first time, we consider
its consistency and stability, which depend on the dissipation of a
transmembrane potential formed by the respiratory chain in the plasmatic
membrane of a cell. The phase-parametric characteristic of the dynamics of the
ATP level depending on a given parameter is constructed. The scenario of
formation of multiple autoperiodic and chaotic modes is presented. Poincar\'{e}
sections and mappings are constructed. The stability of modes and the
fractality of the obtained bifurcations are studied. The full spectra of
Lyapunov indices, divergences, KS-entropies, horizons of predictability, and
Lyapunov dimensionalities of strange attractors are calculated. Some
conclusions about the structural-functional connections determining the
dependence of the cell respiration cyclicity on the synchronization of the
functioning of the tricarboxilic acid cycle and the electron transport chain
are presented.

1602.09108	q-bio	physics.soc-ph q-bio.PE	"Disease spread through animal movements: a static and temporal network
  analysis of pig trade in Germany"	"  Background: Animal trade plays an important role for the spread of infectious
diseases in livestock populations. As a case study, we consider pig trade in
Germany, where trade actors (agricultural premises) form a complex network. The
central question is how infectious diseases can potentially spread within the
system of trade contacts. We address this question by analyzing the underlying
network of animal movements.
  Methodology/Findings: The considered pig trade dataset spans several years
and is analyzed with respect to its potential to spread infectious diseases.
Focusing on measurements of network-topological properties, we avoid the usage
of external parameters, since these properties are independent of specific
pathogens. They are on the contrary of great importance for understanding any
general spreading process on this particular network. We analyze the system
using different network models, which include varying amounts of information:
(i) static network, (ii) network as a time series of uncorrelated snapshots,
(iii) temporal network, where causality is explicitly taken into account.
  Findings: Our approach provides a general framework for a
topological-temporal characterization of livestock trade networks. We find that
a static network view captures many relevant aspects of the trade system, and
premises can be classified into two clearly defined risk classes. Moreover, our
results allow for an efficient allocation strategy for intervention measures
using centrality measures. Data on trade volume does barely alter the results
and is therefore of secondary importance. Although a static network description
yields useful results, the temporal resolution of data plays an outstanding
role for an in-depth understanding of spreading processes. This applies in
particular for an accurate calculation of the maximum outbreak size.

1603.00058	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Neural and perceptual signatures of efficient sensory coding	"  The mammalian brain is a metabolically expensive device, and evolutionary
pressures have presumably driven it to make productive use of its resources.
For sensory areas, this concept has been expressed more formally as an
optimality principle: the brain maximizes the information that is encoded about
relevant sensory variables, given available resources. Here, we develop this
efficiency principle for encoding a sensory variable with a heterogeneous
population of noisy neurons, each responding to a particular range of values.
The accuracy with which the population represents any particular value depends
on the number of cells that respond to that value, their selectivity, and their
response levels. We derive the optimal solution for these parameters in closed
form, as a function of the probability of stimulus values encountered in the
environment. This optimal neural population also imposes limitations on the
ability of the organism to discriminate different values of the encoded
variable. As a result, we predict an explicit relationship between the
statistical properties of the environment, the allocation and selectivity of
neurons within populations, and perceptual discriminability. We test this
relationship for three visual and two auditory attributes, and find that it is
remarkably consistent with existing data.

  time series"	"  Assessment of dynamic functional brain connectivity (dFC) based on fMRI data
is an increasingly popular strategy to investigate temporal dynamics of the
brain's large-scale network architecture. Current practice when deriving
connectivity estimates over time is to use the Fisher transform which aims to
stabilize the variance of correlation values that fluctuate around varying true
correlation values. It is however unclear how well the stabilization of signal
variance performed by the Fisher transform works for each connectivity time
series, when the true correlation is assumed to be fluctuating. This is of
importance because many subsequent analyses either assume or perform better
when the time series have stable variance or adheres to an approximate Gaussian
distribution. In this paper, using simulations and analysis of resting-state
fMRI data, we analyze the effect of applying different variance stabilization
strategies on connectivity time-series. We here focus our investigation on the
Fisher transform, the Box Cox transform and an approach that combines both
transforms. Our results show that, if the intention of stabilizing the variance
is to use metrics on the time series where stable variance or a Gaussian
distribution is desired (e.g. clustering), the Fisher transform is not optimal
and may even skew connectivity time series away from being Gaussian. Further,
we show that the suboptimal performance of the Fisher transform can be
substantially improved by including an additional Box-Cox transformation after
the dFC time series has been Fisher transformed.

disaggregated by HIV status, age and sex. Methods to derive MDR-TB burden
indicators are detailed. Four main methods were used to derive incidence: (i)
case notification data combined with expert opinion about case detection gaps
(120 countries representing 51% of global incidence); (ii) results from
national TB prevalence surveys (19 countries, 46% of global incidence); (iii)
notifications in high-income countries adjusted by a standard factor to account

and (iv) capture-recapture modelling (5 countries, 0.5% of global incidence).
Prevalence was obtained from results of national prevalence surveys in 21
countries, representing 69% of global prevalence). In other countries,
prevalence was estimated from incidence and disease duration. Mortality was
obtained from national vital registration systems of mortality surveys in 129
countries (43% of global HIV-negative TB mortality). In other countries,
mortality was derived indirectly from incidence and case fatality ratio.

  tumor growth"	"  The majority of cancer-related fatalities are due to metastatic disease. In
chemoradiotherapy, chemotherapeutic agents are administered along with
radiation to increase damage to the primary tumor and control systemic disease
such as metastasis. This work introduces a mathematical model to obtain optimal
drug and radiation protocols in a chemoradiotherapy scheduling problem with the
objective of minimizing metastatic cancer cell populations at multiple
potential sites while maintaining a minimum level of damage to the primary
tumor site. We derive closed-form expressions for an optimal chemotherapy
fractionation regimen. A dynamic programming framework is used to determine the
optimal radiotherapy fractionation regimen. Results show that chemotherapeutic
agents do not change the optimal radiation fractionation regimens, and
vice-versa. Interestingly, we observe that regardless of radio-sensitivity
parameters, hypo-fractionated schedules are optimal solutions for the
radiotherapy fractionation problem. Furthermore, it is optimal to immediately
start radiotherapy. However, for chemotherapy, we find that the structure of
the optimal schedule depends on model parameters such as chemotherapy-induced
cell-kill at primary and metastatic sites, as well as the ability of primary
tumor cells to initiate successful metastasis at different body sites. We
quantify the trade-off between the new and traditional objectives of minimizing
the metastatic population size and maximizing the tumor control probability,
respectively, for a cervical cancer case. The trade-off information indicates
the potential for significant reduction in the metastatic population with
minimal loss in primary tumor control.

networks, both weighted and unweighted, and investigate the measure in a
variety of model and real-world networks. We find that most nodes and edges in
model and real networks have a negative curvature. Furthermore, the
distribution of Forman curvature of nodes and edges is narrow in random and
small-world networks, while the distribution is broad in scale-free and
real-world networks. In most networks, Forman curvature is found to display
significant negative correlation with degree and centrality measures. However,
Forman curvature is uncorrelated with clustering coefficient in most networks.
Importantly, we find that both model and real networks are vulnerable to
targeted deletion of nodes with highly negative Forman curvature. Our results
suggest that Forman curvature can be employed to gain novel insights on the
organization of complex networks.

process to implement control measures that ranged from vector control and the
use of repellents to the suggestion of avoiding pregnancies for two years, the

In our study, we explore the impact of short term mobility between two
idealized interconnected communities where disparities and violence contribute
to the Zv epidemic. Using a Lagrangian modeling approach in a two-patch
setting, it is shown via simulations that short term mobility may be beneficial
in the control of a Zv outbreak when risk is relative low and patch disparities
are not too extreme. However, when the reproductive number is too high, there
seems to be no benefits. This paper is dedicated to the inauguration of the

of complex dynamical systems. Parametrising such models to conform to the
multitude of available experimental constraints is a global nonlinear
optimisation problem with a complex fitness landscape, requiring numerical
techniques to find suitable approximate solutions. Stochastic optimisation
approaches, such as evolutionary algorithms, have been shown to be effective,
but often the setting up of such optimisations and the choice of a specific

framework for data-driven model parameter optimisation that wraps and
standardises several existing open-source tools. It simplifies the task of
creating and sharing these optimisations, and the associated techniques and
knowledge. This is achieved by abstracting the optimisation and evaluation
tasks into various reusable and flexible discrete elements according to
established best-practices. Further, BluePyOpt provides methods for setting up
both small- and large-scale optimisations on a variety of platforms, ranging
from laptops to Linux clusters and cloud-based compute infrastructures. The

After division the cells remain attached giving rise to small clusters, with a

and so an understanding of this fundamental process may pave the way to the
identification of novel drugs. We present here a novel image analysis framework
for automated detection and segmentation of cells in S. aureus clusters, and
identification of their cell division planes. We demonstrate the technique on
GFP labelled EzrA, a protein that localises to a mid-cell plane during division
and is involved in regulation of cell size and division. The algorithms may
have wider applicability in detecting morphologically complex structures of
fluorescently-labelled proteins within cells in other cell clusters.

High-throughput video observations, coupled with dedicated experiments with
controlled robot flies have revealed that flies utilize the type of optic flow
on their retina as a determinant of who should stop, a strategy also used by
ship captains to determine which of two ships on a collision course should
throw engines in reverse. We use digital evolution to test whether this
strategy evolves when collision avoidance is the sole penalty. We find that the
strategy does indeed evolve in a narrow range of cost/benefit ratios, for
experiments in which the ""regressive motion"" cue is error free. We speculate
that these stringent conditions may not be sufficient to evolve the strategy in
real flies, pointing perhaps to auxiliary costs and benefits not modeled in our

connections of the human brain. By the development of diffusion magnetic
resonance imaging (diffusion MRI), it is possible today to map the connections
between the 1-1.5 cm$^2$ regions of the gray matter of the human brain. These
connections can be viewed as a graph: the vertices are the anatomically
identified regions of the gray matter, and two vertices are connected by an
edge if the diffusion MRI-based workflow finds neuronal fiber tracts between
these areas. This way we can compute 1015-vertex graphs with tens of thousands
of edges. In a previous work, we have analyzed the male and female braingraphs
graph-theoretically, and we have found statistically significant differences in
numerous parameters between the sexes: the female braingraphs are better
expanders, have more edges, larger bipartition widths, and larger vertex cover
than the braingraphs of the male subjects. Our previous study has applied the

  Evaluation of the Effects of Data Pre-processing"	"  Resting state functional connectivity estimates from MRI measures has become
a promising tool to characterize human brain networks. There are, however,
limitations in the method since several sources of errors have been seen to
significantly affect the final estimates. This has lead to a great interest in
the field to do systematic investigations that help determine the most reliable
and robust strategies to perform functional connectivity analysis. In the
present study, we examine the influence of two aspects of data pre- processing
in resting state functional connectivity analysis: the effect of criteria used
to select nodes in the default mode network (DMN) for the computation of
connectivity, and the effect of using or not physiological noise correction.
Three different strategies of region of interest (ROI) selection were compared
to define DMN node coordinates: (1) ROIs centered on atlas-based coordinates,
(2) ROIs based on the result of group independent component analysis, and (3)
ROIs based on the estimated DMN of each individual. The study was done using
data of 15 healthy volunteers, which had resting state data available from a
separate project. We found that both effects, ROI selection criteria for DMN
nodes and physiological noise correction, have significant effects on the
functional connectivity estimates. In particular, our results show that
physiological noise correction introduces small but significant reductions in
functional connectivity, consistent with a reduction of artifactual non-neural
correlations introduced by physiological effects. Further, selecting DMN nodes
based on the single subject ICA results introduced small but significant
increases in functional connectivity, consistent with higher subject
specificity of the node selection.

  Model, ""Farr's Law"" and Compartmental Difference Equation SIR Models"	"  Mathematical models are often regarded as recent innovations in the
description and analysis of infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics, but
simple models have been in use for projection of epidemic trajectories for more
than a century. We recently described a single equation model (the incidence
decay with exponential adjustment, or IDEA, model) that can be used for short
term forecasting. In the mid-19th century, Dr. William Farr developed a single
equation approach (Farr's law) for epidemic forecasting. We show here that the
two models are in fact identical, and can be expressed in terms of one another,
and also in terms of a susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) compartmental model
with improving control. This demonstrates that the concept of the reproduction
number, R0, is implicit to Farr's (pre-microbial era) work, and also suggests
that control of epidemics, whether via behavior change or intervention, is as
integral to the natural history of epidemics as is the dynamics of disease
transmission.

  sub-exponential growth dynamics"	"  Early estimates of the transmission potential of emerging and re-emerging
infections are increasingly used to inform public health authorities on the
level of risk posed by outbreaks. Existing methods to estimate the reproduction
number generally assume exponential growth in case incidence in the first few
disease generations, before susceptible depletion sets in. In reality,
outbreaks can display sub-exponential (i.e., polynomial) growth in the first
few disease generations, owing to clustering in contact patterns, spatial
effects, inhomogeneous mixing, reactive behavior changes, or other mechanisms.
Here, we introduce the generalized growth model to characterize the early
growth profile of outbreaks and estimate the effective reproduction number,
with no need for explicit assumptions about the shape of epidemic growth. We
demonstrate this phenomenologic approach using analytical results and
simulations from mechanistic models, and provide validation against a range of
empirical disease datasets. Our results suggest that sub-exponential growth in
the early phase of an epidemic is the rule rather the exception. For empirical
outbreaks, the generalized-growth model consistently outperforms the
exponential model for a variety of directly and indirectly transmitted diseases
datasets with model estimates supporting sub-exponential growth dynamics. The
rapid decline in effective reproduction number predicted by analytical results
and observed in real and synthetic datasets within 3-5 disease generations
contrasts with the expectation of invariant reproduction number in epidemics
obeying exponential growth. Overall, our approach promotes a more reliable and
data-driven characterization of the early epidemic phase, which is important
for accurate estimation of the reproduction number and prediction of disease
impact.

cell death may cause hyperplasia in the exposed tissue. As the heterogeneous
deposition of inhaled radon progeny results in high local doses at the peak of
the bronchial bifurcations, it was proposed earlier that hyperplasia occurs in
these deposition hot spots upon chronic radon exposure. The objective of the
present study is to quantify how the induction of basal cell hyperplasia
modulates the microdosimetric consequences of a given radon exposure. For this
purpose, numerical epithelium models were generated with spherical cell nuclei
of six different cell types based on histological data. Basal cell hyperplasia
was modelled by epithelium models with additional basal cells and increased
epithelium thickness. Microdosimetry for alpha-particles was performed by an

the average hit number and dose of basal cells decrease by the increase of the
measure of hyperplasia. Hit and dose distribution reveal that the induction of
hyperplasia may result in a basal cell pool which is shielded from alpha
radiation. It highlights that the exposure history affects the microdosimetric
consequences of a present exposure, while the biological and health effects may
also depend on previous exposures. The induction of hyperplasia can be
considered as a radioadaptive response at the tissue level. Such an adaptation
of the tissue challenges the validity of the application of the dose dose rate
effectiveness factor from a mechanistic point of view. As the location of
radiosensitive target cells may change due to previous exposures, dosimetry

be inappropriate for dose estimation in case of protracted exposures. As

  opposite emotional states"	"  In human studies, how averaged activation in a brain region relates to human
behavior has been extensively investigated. This approach has led to the
finding that positive and negative facial preferences are represented by
different brain regions. However, using a multi-voxel pattern induction method
we found that different patterns of neural activations within the cingulate
cortex (CC) play roles in representing opposite emotional states. In the
present study, while neutrally-preferred faces were presented, activation
patterns in the CC that corresponded to higher (or lower) preference were
repeatedly induced by the pattern induction method. As a result, previously
neutrally-preferred faces became more (or less) preferred. We conclude that a
different activation pattern in the CC, rather than averaged activation in a
different area, represents and causally determines positive or negative facial
preference. This new approach may reveal importance in an activation pattern
within a brain region in many cognitive functions.

1603.01488	q-bio	cs.AI q-bio.MN	"A knowledge representation meta-model for rule-based modelling of
  signalling networks"	"  The study of cellular signalling pathways and their deregulation in disease
states, such as cancer, is a large and extremely complex task. Indeed, these
systems involve many parts and processes but are studied piecewise and their
literatures and data are consequently fragmented, distributed and sometimes--at
least apparently--inconsistent. This makes it extremely difficult to build
significant explanatory models with the result that effects in these systems
that are brought about by many interacting factors are poorly understood.
  The rule-based approach to modelling has shown some promise for the
representation of the highly combinatorial systems typically found in
signalling where many of the proteins are composed of multiple binding domains,
capable of simultaneous interactions, and/or peptide motifs controlled by
post-translational modifications. However, the rule-based approach requires
highly detailed information about the precise conditions for each and every
interaction which is rarely available from any one single source. Rather, these
conditions must be painstakingly inferred and curated, by hand, from
information contained in many papers--each of which contains only part of the
story.
  In this paper, we introduce a graph-based meta-model, attuned to the
representation of cellular signalling networks, which aims to ease this massive
cognitive burden on the rule-based curation process. This meta-model is a
generalization of that used by Kappa and BNGL which allows for the flexible
representation of knowledge at various levels of granularity. In particular, it
allows us to deal with information which has either too little, or too much,
detail with respect to the strict rule-based meta-model. Our approach provides
a basis for the gradual aggregation of fragmented biological knowledge
extracted from the literature into an instance of the meta-model from which we
can define an automated translation into executable Kappa programs.

  and Fitness"	"  Quantitative single cell measurements have shown that cell cycle duration
(the time between cell divisions) for diverse cell types is a noisy variable.
The underlying distribution is mean scalable with a universal shape for many
cell types in a variety of environments. Here we show through both experiment
and theory that increasing the amount of noise in the regulation of the cell
cycle negatively impacts the growth rate but positively correlates with
improved cellular response to fluctuating environments. Our findings suggest
that even non-cooperative cells in exponential growth phase do not optimize
fitness through growth rate alone, but also optimize adaptability to changing
conditions. In a manner similar to genetic evolution, increasing the noise in
biochemical processes correlates with improved response of the system to
environmental changes.

folding, docking and design. However, rigorous calculation of free energy
change is prohibitively expensive in these practical applications. The minimum
potential energy is therefore widely utilized to approximate free energy. In
this study, based on analysis of extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
trajectories of a few native globular proteins, we found that change of minimum
and corresponding maximum potential energy terms exhibit similar level of
correlation with change of free energy. More importantly, we demonstrated that
change of span (maximum - minimum) of potential energy terms, which engender
negligible additional computational cost, exhibit considerably stronger
correlations with change of free energy than the corresponding change of
minimum and maximum potential energy terms. Therefore, potential energy span
may serve as an alternative efficient approximate free energy proxy.

  crowded environment"	"  Certain biological reactions, such as receptor-ligand binding at cell-cell
interfaces and macromolecules binding to biopolymers, require many smaller
molecules crowding a reaction site to be cleared. Examples include the T cell
interface, a key player in immunological information processing. Diffusion sets
a limit for such cavitation to occur spontaneously, thereby defining a
timescale below which active mechanisms must take over. We consider $N$
independent diffusing particles in a closed domain, containing a sub-region
with $N_{0}$ particles, on average. We investigate the time until the
sub-region is empty, allowing a subsequent reaction to proceed. The first
passage time is computed using an efficient exact simulation algorithm and an
asymptotic approximation in the limit that cavitation is rare. In this limit,
we find that the mean first passage time is sub-exponential, $T \propto
e^{N_{0}}/N_{0}^2$. For the case of T cell receptors, we find that stochastic
cavitation is exceedingly slow, $10^9$ seconds at physiological densities,
however can be accelerated to occur within 5 second with only a four-fold
dilution.

statistics, including null-hypothesis testing, t-tests, and ANOVA. Throughout
recent years, statistical learning methods enjoy increasing popularity,
including cross-validation, pattern classification, and sparsity-inducing
regression. These two methodological families used for neuroimaging data
analysis can be viewed as two extremes of a continuum. Yet, they originated
from different historical contexts, build on different theories, rest on
different assumptions, evaluate different outcome metrics, and permit different
conclusions. This paper portrays commonalities and differences between
classical statistics and statistical learning with their relation to
neuroimaging research. The conceptual implications are illustrated in three
common analysis scenarios. It is thus tried to resolve possible confusion
between classical hypothesis testing and data-guided model estimation by
discussing their ramifications for the neuroimaging access to neurobiology.

movement of organisms and processes between areas of intact habitat, and thus
provide landscape corridor. Corridors are thus regions within a given landscape
that generally comprise native vegetation, and connect otherwise fragmented,
disconnected, non-contiguous wildlife habitat patches in the landscape. The
purpose of designing corridors as a conservation strategy is primarily to
counter, and to the extent possible, mitigate the impacts of habitat
fragmentation and loss on the biodiversity of the landscape, as well as support
continuance of land use for essential local and global economic activities in
the region of reference. In this paper, we use game theory and graph theory to
model and design a wildlife corridor network in the Central India Eastern Ghats
landscape complex, with tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) as the focal species. We
construct a graph using the habitat patches supporting wild tiger populations
in the landscape complex as vertices and the possible paths between these
vertices as edges. A cost matrix is constructed to indicate the cost incurred
by the tiger for passage between the habitat patches in the landscape, by
modelling a two-person Prisoners Dilemma game. A minimum spanning tree is then
obtained by employing Kruskals algorithm, which would suggest a feasible tiger
corridor network for the tiger population within the landscape complex.
Additionally, analysis of the graph is done using various centrality measures,
in order to identify and focus on potentially important habitat patches, and
their potential community structure. Correlation analysis is performed on the
centrality indices to draw out interesting trends in the network.

arriving at and remaining about a manifold of 'solutions' embedded in a high
dimensional parameter space. Alongside studies that extend traditional focus on
control-based regulation of structural parameters (channel densities), there is
a budding interest in self-organization of kinetic parameters. In this picture,
ionic channels are continually forced by activity in-and-out of a large pool of
states not available for the mechanism of excitability. The process, acting on
expressed structure, provides a bed for generation of a spectrum of
excitability modes. Driven by microscopic fluctuations over a broad range of
temporal scales, self-organization of kinetic parameters extends the metaphors
and tools used in the study of development of excitability.

retroviruses, to copy and move inside eukaryotic genomes. In the present work,
we propose a branching model for studying the propagation of LTR
retrotransposons in these genomes. This model allows to take into account both
positions and degradations of LTR retrotransposons copies. In our model, the
duplication rate is also allowed to vary with the degradation level.
  Results: Various functions have been implemented in order to simulate their
spread and visualization tools are proposed. Based on these simulation tools,
we show that an accurate estimation of the parameters of this propagation model
can be performed. We applied this method to the study of the spread of the
transposable elements ROO, GYPSY, and DM412 on a chromosome of
\textit{Drosophila melanogaster}.
  Availability: Our proposal has been implemented using Python software. Source

1603.02021	q-bio	q-bio.GN	Machine Learning for Protein Function	"  Systematic identification of protein function is a key problem in current
biology. Most traditional methods fail to identify functionally equivalent
proteins if they lack similar sequences, structural data or extensive manual
annotations. In this thesis, I focused on feature engineering and machine
learning methods for identifying diverse classes of proteins that share
functional relatedness but little sequence or structural similarity, notably,
Neuropeptide Precursors (NPPs).
  I aim to identify functional protein classes solely using unannotated protein
primary sequences from any organism. This thesis focuses on feature
representations of whole protein sequences, sequence derived engineered
features, their extraction, frameworks for their usage by machine learning (ML)
models, and the application of ML models to biological tasks, focusing on high
level protein functions. I implemented the ideas of feature engineering to
develop a platform (called NeuroPID) that extracts meaningful features for
classification of overlooked NPPs. The platform allows mass discovery of new
NPs and NPPs. It was expanded as a webserver.
  I expanded our approach towards other challenging protein classes. This is
implemented as a novel bioinformatics toolkit called ProFET (Protein Feature
Engineering Toolkit). ProFET extracts hundreds of biophysical and sequence
derived attributes, allowing the application of machine learning methods to
proteins. ProFET was applied on many protein benchmark datasets with state of
the art performance. The success of ProFET applies to a wide range of
high-level functions such as metagenomic analysis, subcellular localization,
structure and unique functional properties (e.g. thermophiles, nucleic acid
binding).
  These methods and frameworks represent a valuable resource for using ML and
data science methods on proteins.

  induced by voltage steps"	"  A new stimulation paradigm is presented for the stimulation of nerve cells by
extracellular electric currents. In the new paradigm stimulation is achieved
with the current spike induced by a voltage step whenever the voltage step is
applied to a live biological tissue. By experimental evidence and theoretical
arguments, it is shown that this spike is well suited for the stimulation of
nerve cells. Stimulation of the human tongue is used for proof of principle.
Charge injection thresholds are measured for various voltages. The time-profile
of the current spike used in the experiment has a half-width of about 1
microsecond. The decay of the spike is non-exponential. The spike has at least
three distinctly different phases. A Maxwell phase is followed by a
charge-rearrangement phase. Charging of cell membranes is completed in a third
phase. All three phases contribute to depolarization or hyperpolarization of
cell membranes. Due to the short duration of the spike the charge transfer is
very small. The activation time (time of no return) of nerve cell membranes
leading to an action potential is measured and found to be unexpectedly short.
It can become as short as 3 microseconds for a voltage step of 10 V or higher.

  brain: IT point of view (June, 2016)"	"  Glia modify neuronal connectivity by creating structural changes in the
neuronal connectome. Glia also influence the functional connectome by modifying
the flow of information through neural networks (Fields et al. 2015). There are
strong experimental evidences that glia are responsible for synaptic
meta-plasticity. Synaptic plasticity is the modification of the strength of
connections between neurons. Meta-plasticity, i.e. plasticity of synaptic
plasticity, may be viewed as mechanisms for dynamic reconfiguration of neuron
circuits. First order computations in the brain are done by static neuron
circuits, whereas higher order computations are done by dynamic
reconfigurations of the links (synapses) between the neuron circuits. Static
neuron circuits correspond to first order computable functions. Synapse
creation correspond to the mathematical notion of function composition.
Functionals are higher order functions that take functions as their arguments.
The construction of functionals is based on dynamic reconfigurations of the
function composition. Perhaps the functionals correspond to the meta-plasticity
in the human brain.

remains a subject of debate. We build a paradigm model combining a utility game
for the individual-level dilemma of prevention versus treatment, and a
compartmental model for the epidemic dynamic. We assume that individuals arrive
to maximize the utility of voluntary prevention, as the epidemic reaches an
endemic level alleviated by prevention and treatment. We thus obtain an
expression for the asymptotic prevention coverage. Notably, we obtain that, if
the relative cost of prevention versus treatment is sufficiently low, epidemics
may be averted through the use of prevention alone.

1603.02265	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Bayesian monitoring of emerging infectious diseases	"  We define data analyses to monitor a change in R, the average number of
secondary cases caused by a typical infected individual. The input dataset
consists of incident cases partitioned into outbreaks, each initiated from a
single index case. We split of the input dataset into two successive subsets,
to evaluate two successive R values, according to the Bayesian paradigm. We
used the Bayes factor between the model with two different R values and that
with a single R value to justify that the change in R is statistically
significant. We validated our approach using simulated data, generated using
known R. In particular, we found that claiming two distinct R values may depend
significantly on the number of outbreaks. We then reanalyzed data previously
studied by Jansen et al. [Jansen et al. Science 301 (5634), 804], concerning
the effective reproduction number for measles in the UK, during 1995-2002. Our
analyses showed that the 1995-2002 dataset should be divided into two separate
subsets for the periods 1995-1998 and 1999-2002. In contrast, Jansen et al.
take this splitting point as input of their analysis. Our estimated effective
reproduction numbers R are in good agreement with those found by Jansen et al.
In conclusion, our methodology for detecting temporal changes in R using
outbreak-size data worked satisfactorily with both simulated and real-world
data. The methodology may be used for updating R in real time, as surveillance
outbreak data become available.

  force-induced flows"	"  We derive from first principles a three-dimensional theory of self-propelled
particle swarming in a viscous fluid environment. Our model predicts emergent
collective behavior that depends critically on fluid opacity, mechanism of
self-propulsion, and type of particle-particle interaction. In ""clear fluids""
swimmers have full knowledge of their surroundings and can adjust their
velocities with respect to the lab frame, while in ""opaque fluids,"" they
control their velocities only in relation to the local fluid flow. We also show
that ""social"" interactions that affect only a particle's propensity to swim
towards or away from neighbors induces a flow field that is qualitatively
different from the long-ranged flow fields generated by direct ""physical""
interactions. The latter can be short-ranged but lead to much longer-ranged
fluid-mediated hydrodynamic forces, effectively amplifying the range over which
particles interact. These different fluid flows conspire to profoundly affect
swarm morphology, kinetically stabilizing or destabilizing swarm configurations
that would arise in the absence of fluid. Depending upon the overall
interaction potential, the mechanism of swimming (e.g., pushers or pullers),
and the degree of fluid opaqueness, we discover a number of new collective
three-dimensional patterns including flocks with prolate or oblate shapes,
recirculating peloton-like structures, and jet-like fluid flows that entrain
particles mediating their escape from the center of mill-like structures. Our
results reveal how the interplay among general physical elements influence
fluid-mediated interactions and the self-organization, mobility, and stability
of new three-dimensional swarms and suggest how they might be used to
kinetically control their collective behavior.

varying inputs and parameters. We employ a combination of regular perturbation
and an adiabatic approximation to derive equations for the phase-difference
between a pair of oscillators. We apply this to the simple Hopf oscillator and
then to a biophysical model. The latter represents the behavior of a neuron
that is subject to slow modulation of a muscarinic current such as would occur
during transient attention through cholinergic activation. Our method extends
and simplifies the recent work of Kurebayashi (Physical Review Letters, 111,
214101, 2013) to include coupling. We apply the method to an all-to-all network
and show that there is a waxing and waning of synchrony of modulated neurons.

from the World Health Organization WHO based on the mortality mx of a
population provided in a classical life table and a mortality diagram. Our
estimates are compared with the HALE estimates for the World territories and
the WHO regions along with providing comparative results with to findings of
Chang, Molla, Truman et al. (2015) on the Differences in healthy life
expectancy for the US population by sex, race or ethnicity and geographic
region in 2008 and from Yong and Saito (2009) regarding Trends in healthy life
expectancy in Japan. From the mortality point of view we have developed a
simple model for the estimation of a characteristic parameter b related to the
healthy life years lost to disability and providing full application details
along with characteristic parameter selection and stability of the
coefficients. We also provide a direct estimation method of the parameter b
from the life tables. We straighten the importance of our methodology by
proposing and applying estimates of the parameter b by using the Gompertz and
the Weibull models. From the Health State point of view we summarize the main
points of the first exit time theory to life table data and present the basic
models starting from the first related model published by Janssen and Skiadas
(1995). Even more we develop the simpler 2-parameter health state model and an
extension of a model expressing the infant mortality to a 4-parameter model
which is the simpler model providing very good fitting on the logarithm of the
force of mortality. More important is the use of the Health State Function and
the relative impact on mortality to find an estimate for the healthy life years
lost to disability.

  terminal effects"	"  The fidelity of DNA replication by DNA polymerase (DNAP) has long been an
important issue in biology. While numerous experiments have revealed details of
the molecular structure and working mechanism of DNAP which consists of both a
polymerase site and an exonuclease (proofreading) site, there were quite few
theoretical studies on the fidelity issue. The first model which explicitly
considered both sites was proposed in 1970s' and the basic idea was widely
accepted by later models. However, all these models did not systematically and
rigorously investigate the dominant factor on DNAP fidelity, i.e, the
higher-order terminal effects through which the polymerization pathway and the
proofreading pathway coordinate to achieve high fidelity. In this paper, we
propose a new and comprehensive kinetic model of DNAP based on some recent
experimental observations, which includes previous models as special cases. We
present a rigorous and unified treatment of the corresponding steady-state
kinetic equations of any-order terminal effects, and derive analytical
expressions for fidelity in terms of kinetic parameters under bio-relevant
conditions. These expressions offer new insights on how the the higher-order
terminal effects contribute substantially to the fidelity in an order-by-order
way, and also show that the polymerization-and-proofreading mechanism is
dominated only by very few key parameters. We then apply these results to
calculate the fidelity of some real DNAPs, which are in good agreements with
previous intuitive estimates given by experimentalists.

biochemical reactions. Fluctuations in the components of these regulatory
networks result in noise that invariably corrupts the signal, possibly
compromising function. Here, we create a practical formalism based on ideas
introduced by Wiener and Kolmogorov (WK) for filtering noise in engineered
communications systems to quantitatively assess the extent to which noise can
be controlled in biological processes involving negative feedback. Application
of the theory, which reproduces the previously proven scaling of the lower
bound for noise suppression in terms of the number of signaling events, shows
that a tetracycline repressor-based negative-regulatory gene circuit behaves as
a WK filter. For the class of Hill-like nonlinear regulatory functions, this
type of filter provides the optimal reduction in noise. Our theoretical
approach can be readily combined with experimental measurements of response
functions in a wide variety of genetic circuits, to elucidate the general
principles by which biological networks minimize noise.

  insight from a mathematical model of oscillating neuroendocrine dynamics"	"  The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a neuroendocrine system that
regulates numerous physiological processes. Disruptions in the activity of the
HPA axis are correlated with many stress-related diseases such as
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder. In this
paper, we characterize ""normal"" and ""diseased"" states of the HPA axis as basins
of attraction of a dynamical system describing the inhibition of peptide
hormones such as corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH) by circulating glucocorticoids such as cortisol (CORT). In
addition to including key physiological features such as ultradian oscillations
in cortisol levels and self-upregulation of CRH neuron activity, our model
distinguishes the relatively slow process of cortisol-mediated CRH biosynthesis
from rapid trans-synaptic effects that regulate the CRH secretion process.
Crucially, we find that the slow regulation mechanism mediates external
stress-driven transitions between the stable states in novel, intensity,
duration, and timing-dependent ways. These results indicate that the timing of
traumatic events may be an important factor in determining if and how patients
will exhibit hallmarks of stress disorders. Our model also suggests a mechanism
whereby exposure therapy of stress disorders such as PTSD may act to normalize
downstream dysregulation of the HPA axis.

1603.02798	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Temporal code versus rate code for binary Information Sources	"  Neuroscientists formulate very different hypotheses about the nature of
neural code. At one extreme, it has been argued that neurons encode information
in relatively slow changes of individual spikes arriving ""rates codes"" and the
irregularity in the spike trains reflects noise in the system, while in the
other extreme this irregularity is the temporal codes thus the precise timing
of every spike carries additional information about the input. It is known that
in the estimation of Shannon information the patterns and temporal structures
are taken into account, while the rate code is determined by firing rate. We
compare these types of codes for binary Information Sources which model encoded
spike-trains. Assuming that the information transmitted by a neuron is governed
by uncorrelated stochastic process or by process with a memory we compare the
information transmission rates carried by such spike-trains with their firing
rates. We showed that the crucial role in the relation between information and
firing rates is played by a quantity which we call ""jumping"" parameter. It
corresponds to the probabilities of transitions from no-spike-state to the
spike-state and vice versa. For low values of jumping parameter the quotient of
information and firing rates is monotonically decreasing function of firing
rate, thus there is straightforward, one-to-one, relation between temporal and
rate codes. On the contrary, it turns out that for large enough jumping
parameter this quotient is non-monotonic function of firing rate and it
exhibits a global maximum, in this case optimal firing rate exists. Moreover,
there is no one-to-one relation between information and firing rates, so the
temporal and rate codes differ qualitatively. This leads to the observation
that the behavior of the quotient of information and firing rates for large
jumping parameter is important in the context of bursting phenomena.

1603.02916	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Analysis of neuronal sequences using pairwise biases	"  Sequences of neuronal activation have long been implicated in a variety of
brain functions. In particular, these sequences have been tied to memory
formation and spatial navigation in the hippocampus, a region of mammalian
brains. Traditionally, neuronal sequences have been interpreted as noisy
manifestations of neuronal templates (i.e., orderings), ignoring much richer
structure contained in the sequences. This paper introduces a new tool for
understanding neuronal sequences: the bias matrix. The bias matrix captures the
probabilistic tendency of each neuron to fire before or after each other
neuron. Despite considering only pairs of neurons, the bias matrix captures the
best total ordering of neurons for a sequence (Proposition 3.3) and, thus,
generalizes the concept of a neuronal template.
  We establish basic mathematical properties of bias matrices, in particular
describing the fundamental polytope in which all biases reside (Theorem 3.25).
We show how the underlying simple digraph of a bias matrix, which we term the
bias network, serves as a combinatorial generalization of neuronal templates.
Surprisingly, every simple digraph is realizable as the bias network of some
sequence (Theorem 3.34). The bias-matrix representation leads us to a natural
method for sequence correlation, which then leads to a probabilistic framework
for determining the similarity of one set of sequences to another. Using data
from rat hippocampus, we describe events of interest and also
sequence-detection techniques. Finally, the bias matrix and the similarity
measure are applied to this real-world data using code developed by us.

  patterns of trypanosomatid flagellate protozoa"	"  We report on a diffusive analysis of the motion of flagellate protozoa
species. These parasites are the etiological agents of neglected tropical
diseases: leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania amazonensis and Leishmania
braziliensis, African sleeping sickness caused by Trypanosoma brucei, and
Chagas disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. By tracking the positions of these
parasites and evaluating the variance related to the radial positions, we find
that their motions are characterized by a short-time transient superdiffusive
behavior. Also, the probability distributions of the radial positions are
self-similar and can be approximated by a stretched Gaussian distribution. We
further investigate the probability distributions of the radial velocities of
individual trajectories. Among several candidates, we find that the generalized
gamma distribution shows a good agreement with these distributions. The
velocity time series have long-range correlations, displaying a strong
persistent behavior (Hurst exponents close to one). The prevalence of
""universal"" patterns across all analyzed species indicates that similar
mechanisms may be ruling the motion of these parasites, despite their
differences in morphological traits. In addition, further analysis of these
patterns could become a useful tool for investigating the activity of new
candidate drugs against these and others neglected tropical diseases.

application for extracting blink rate variability, a novel concept that might
shed some light on the mental processes. In this study, 14 EEG recordings were

1603.03141	q-bio	q-bio.QM math.OC stat.CO	Calibrar: an R package for fitting complex ecological models	"  The fitting or parameter estimation of complex ecological models is a
challenging optimization task, with a notable lack of tools for fitting complex
stochastic models. calibrar is an R package that has been developed for fitting
complex ecological models to data, including complex Individual Based Models.
It is a generic tool that can be used for any type of model, especially those
with non-differentiable objective functions. calibrar supports multiple phases
and constrained optimization. It implements maximum likelihood estimation
methods and automated construction of the objective function from simulated
model outputs. User-level expertise in R is necessary to handle calibration
experiments with calibrar, but there is no need to modify the model's code,
which can be programmed in any language. For more experienced users, calibrar
allows the implementation of user-defined objective functions. The package
source code is fully accessible from github
(htpps://roliveros-ramos.github.com/calibrar) and can be installed directly
from CRAN.

1603.03162	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Decoded fMRI neurofeedback can induce bidirectional behavioral changes
  within single participants"	"  Studies using real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) have
recently incorporated the decoding approach, allowing for fMRI to be used as a
tool for manipulation of fine-grained neural activity. Because of the
tremendous potential for clinical applications, certain questions regarding
decoded neurofeedback (DecNef) must be addressed. Neurofeedback effects can
last for months, but the short- to mid-term dynamics are not known.
Specifically, can the same subjects learn to induce neural patterns in two
opposite directions in different sessions? This leads to a further question,
whether learning to reverse a neural pattern may be less effective after
training to induce it in a previous session. Here we employed a
within-subjects' design, with subjects undergoing DecNef training sequentially
in opposite directions (up or down regulation of confidence judgements in a
perceptual task), with the order counterbalanced across subjects. Behavioral
results indicated that the manipulation was strongly influenced by the order
and direction of neurofeedback. We therefore applied nonlinear mathematical
modeling to parametrize four main consequences of DecNef: main effect of change
in behavior, strength of down-regulation effect relative to up-regulation,
maintenance of learning over sessions, and anterograde learning interference.
Modeling results revealed that DecNef successfully induced bidirectional
behavioral changes in different sessions. Furthermore, up-regulation was more
sizable, and the effect was largely preserved even after an interval of
one-week. Lastly, the second week effect was diminished as compared to the
first week effect, indicating strong anterograde learning interference. These
results suggest reinforcement learning characteristics of DecNef, and provide
important constraints on its application to basic neuroscience, occupational
and sports trainings, and therapies.

deadliest epidemic in history. As an infectious disease epidemiology, Ebola is
the most lethal and is moving faster than in previous outbreaks. On 8 August
2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health
emergency of international concern. Last update on 7 July 2015 by WHO reports
27 609 cases of Ebola with a total of 11 261 deaths. In this work, we present a
mathematical description of the spread of Ebola virus based on the SEIR
(Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered) model and optimal strategies for
Ebola control. In order to control the propagation of the virus and to predict
the impact of vaccine programmes, we investigate several strategies of optimal
control of the spread of Ebola: control infection by vaccination of
susceptible; minimize exposed and infected; reduce Ebola infection by
vaccination and education.

parameter-free and time-scale independent measures of spike train synchrony. It

be applied in other contexts like climate research or social sciences. The

  systems"	"  We explore a definition of complexity based on logic functions, which are
widely used as compact descriptions of rules in diverse fields of contemporary
science. Detailed numerical analysis shows that (i) logic complexity is
effective in discriminating between classes of functions commonly employed in
modelling contexts; (ii) it extends the notion of canalisation, used in the
study of genetic regulation, to a more general and detailed measure; (iii) it
is tightly linked to the resilience of a function's output to noise affecting
its inputs. We demonstrate its utility by measuring it in empirical data on
gene regulation, digital circuitry, and propositional calculus. Logic
complexity is exceptionally low in these systems. The asymmetry between ""on""
and ""off"" states in the data correlates with the complexity in a non-null way;
a model of random Boolean networks clarifies this trend and indicates a common
hierarchical architecture in the three systems.

1603.03346	q-bio	q-bio.QM	"Coupling volume-excluding compartment-based models of diffusion at
  different scales: Voronoi and pseudo-compartment approaches"	"  Numerous processes across both the physical and biological sciences are
driven by diffusion. Partial differential equations (PDEs) are a popular tool
for modelling such phenomena deterministically, but it is often necessary to
use stochastic models to accurately capture the behaviour of a system,
especially when the number of diffusing particles is low. The stochastic models
we consider in this paper are `compartment-based': the domain is discretized
into compartments, and particles can jump between these compartments.
Volume-excluding effects (crowding) can be incorporated by blocking movement
with some probability.
  Recent work has established the connection between fine-grained models and
coarse-grained models incorporating volume exclusion, but only for uniform
lattices. In this paper we consider non-uniform, hybrid lattices that
incorporate both fine- and coarse-grained regions, and present two different
approaches to describing the interface of the regions. We test both techniques
in a range of scenarios to establish their accuracy, benchmarking against
fine-grained models, and show that the hybrid models developed in this paper
can be significantly faster to simulate than the fine-grained models in certain
situations, and are at least as fast otherwise.

  Algorithm in Watson-Crick and Nussinov-Jacobson Energy Models"	"  We consider the Combinatorial RNA Design problem, a minimal instance of RNA
design where one must produce an RNA sequence that adopts a given secondary
structure as its minimal free-energy structure. We consider two free-energy
models where the contributions of base pairs are additive and independent: the
purely combinatorial Watson-Crick model, which only allows equally-contributing
A -- U and C -- G base pairs, and the real-valued Nussinov-Jacobson model,
which associates arbitrary energies to A -- U, C -- G and G -- U base pairs. We
first provide a complete characterization of designable structures using
restricted alphabets and, in the four-letter alphabet, provide a complete
characterization for designable structures without unpaired bases. When
unpaired bases are allowed, we characterize extensive classes of
(non-)designable structures, and prove the closure of the set of designable
structures under the stutter operation. Membership of a given structure to any
of the classes can be tested in $\Theta$(n) time, including the generation of a
solution sequence for positive instances. Finally, we consider a
structure-approximating relaxation of the design, and provide a $\Theta$(n)
algorithm which, given a structure S that avoids two trivially non-designable
motifs, transforms S into a designable structure constructively by adding at
most one base-pair to each of its stems.

of the ancestor in a two-type Wright-Fisher population with mutation and
selection, conditional on the overall type frequency in the old population.
This extends results from Lenz, Kluth, Baake, and Wakolbinger (Theor. Pop.

reproduction measure $\Lambda$. The representation is in terms of the

We identify a strong pathwise Siegmund dual of $L$, and characterise the
equilibrium tail probabilities of $L$ in terms of hitting probabilities of the
dual process.

theoretically. We explore a mean field approximation to describe the temporal
evolution of an ecological system with the basic prey-predator interspecies
relation, as well as an approximation to introduce time correlations in the
dynamics. We start by discussing the solution of the Volterra-Lotka model in a
mean field approximation based in an analogy with the Weiss solution to the
Ising model for ferromagnetic materials. In order to explore the effects of
long-range time correlations, we describe the time evolution of the system
within a kind of Bragg-Williams approximation. This approach allows us to
evaluate a characteristic life-time of the ecosystem. This quantity could be
very useful to discuss the time evolution of the system under a wide diversity
of environmental conditions of the ecosystem which is not usually considered.
We discuss the general trends of the temporal evolution of the association with
some data from real ecosystems.

  nucleotide ratios"	"  Given a random RNA secondary structure, $S$, we study RNA sequences having
fixed ratios of nuclotides that are compatible with $S$. We perform this
analysis for RNA secondary structures subject to various base pairing rules and
minimum arc- and stack-length restrictions. Our main result reads as follows:
in the simplex of the nucleotide ratios there exists a convex region in which,
in the limit of long sequences, a random structure a.a.s.~has compatible
sequence with these ratios and outside of which a.a.s.~a random structure has
no such compatible sequence. We localize this region for RNA secondary
structures subject to various base pairing rules and minimum arc- and
stack-length restrictions. In particular, for {\bf GC}-sequences having a ratio
of {\bf G} nucleotides smaller than $1/3$, a random RNA secondary structure
without any minimum arc- and stack-length restrictions has a.a.s.~no such
compatible sequence. For sequences having a ratio of {\bf G} nucleotides larger
than $1/3$, a random RNA secondary structure has a.a.s. such compatible
sequences. We discuss our results in the context of various families of RNA
structures.

inversion stress microscopy (BISM), is validated using numerical simulations
performed in a wide range of conditions. It is robust to changes in each
ingredient of the underlying statistical model. Importantly, its accuracy does
not depend on the rheology of the tissue. We apply BISM to experimental
traction force data measured in a narrow ring of cohesive epithelial cells, and
check that the inferred stress field coincides with that obtained by direct
spatial integration of the traction force data in this quasi-one-dimensional

1603.03767	q-bio	q-bio.PE physics.soc-ph	Intervality and coherence in complex networks	"  Food webs -- networks of predators and prey -- have long been known to
exhibit ""intervality"": species can generally be ordered along a single axis in
such a way that the prey of any given predator tend to lie on unbroken compact
intervals. Although the meaning of this axis -- identified with a ""niche""
dimension -- has remained a mystery, it is assumed to lie at the basis of the
highly non-trivial structure of food webs. With this in mind, most trophic
network modelling has for decades been based on assigning species a niche value
by hand. However, we argue here that intervality should not be considered the
cause but rather a consequence of food-web structure. First, analysing a set of
$46$ empirical food webs, we find that they also exhibit {\it predator}
intervality: the predators of any given species are as likely to be contiguous
as the prey are, but in a different ordering. Furthermore, this property is not
exclusive of trophic networks: several networks of genes, neurons, metabolites,
cellular machines, airports, and words are found to be approximately as
interval as food webs. We go on to show that a simple model of food-web
assembly which does not make use of a niche axis can nevertheless generate
significant intervality. Therefore, the niche dimension (in the sense used for
food-web modelling) could in fact be the consequence of other, more fundamental
structural traits, such as trophic coherence. We conclude that a new approach
to food-web modelling is required for a deeper understanding of ecosystem
assembly, structure and function, and propose that certain topological features
thought to be specific of food webs are in fact common to many complex
networks.

  Parameters using Shear Data"	"  Cardiac muscle tissue during relaxation is commonly modelled as a
hyperelastic material with strongly nonlinear and anisotropic stress response.
Adapting the behavior of such a model to experimental or patient data gives
rise to a parameter estimation problem which involves a significant number of
parameters. Gradient-based optimization algorithms provide a way to solve such
nonlinear parameter estimation problems with relatively few iterations, but
require the gradient of the objective functional with respect to the model
parameters. This gradient has traditionally been obtained using finite
differences, the calculation of which scales linearly with the number of model
parameters, and introduces a differencing error. By using an automatically
derived adjoint equation, we are able to calculate this gradient more
efficiently, and with minimal implementation effort. We test this adjoint
framework on a least squares fitting problem involving data from simple shear
tests on cardiac tissue samples. A second challenge which arises in
gradient-based optimization is the dependency of the algorithm on a suitable
initial guess. We show how a multi-start procedure can alleviate this
dependency. Finally, we provide estimates for the material parameters of the
Holzapfel and Ogden strain energy law using finite element models together with
experimental shear data.

important challenges of current healthcare. In this project we developed an
approach whereby a frequently played computer game can be used to assess a
variety of cognitive processes and estimate the results of the pen-and-paper
Trail-Making Test (TMT) - known to measure executive function, as well as
visual pattern recognition, speed of processing, working memory, and
set-switching ability. We developed a computational model of the TMT based on a
decomposition of the test into several independent processes, each
characterized by a set of parameters that can be estimated from play of a
computer game designed to resemble the TMT. An empirical evaluation of the
model suggests that it is possible to use the game data to estimate the
parameters of the underlying cognitive processes and using the values of the
parameters to estimate the TMT performance. Cognitive measures and trends in
these measures can be used to identify individuals for further assessment, to
provide a mechanism for improving the early detection of neurological problems,
and to provide feedback and monitoring for cognitive interventions in the home.

  network"	"  Brain research has been driven by enquiry for principles of brain structure
organization and its control mechanisms. The neuronal wiring map of C. elegans,
the only complete connectome available till date, presents an incredible
opportunity to learn basic governing principles that drive structure and
function of its neuronal architecture. Despite its apparently simple nervous
system, C. elegans is known to possess complex functions. The neuronal
architecture forms an important underlying framework which specifies phenotypic
features associated to sensation, movement, conditioning and memory. In this
study, with the help of graph theoretical models, we investigated the C.
elegans neuronal network to identify network features that are critical for its
control. The 'driver neurons' are associated with important biological
functions such as reproduction, signalling processes and anatomical structural
development. We created 1D and 2D network models of C. elegans neuronal system
to probe the role of features that confer controllability and small world
nature. The simple 1D ring model is critically poised for the number of feed
forward motifs, neuronal clustering and characteristic path-length in response
to synaptic rewiring, indicating optimal rewiring. Using empirically observed
distance constraint in the neuronal network as a guiding principle, we created
a distance constrained synaptic plasticity model that simultaneously explains
small world nature, saturation of feed forward motifs as well as observed
number of driver neurons. The distance constrained model suggests optimum long
distance synaptic connections as a key feature specifying control of the
network.

1603.04007	q-bio	q-bio.PE physics.bio-ph	Deciphering infant mortality. Part 1: empirical evidence	"  This paper is not (or at least not only) about human infant mortality. In
line with reliability theory, ""infant"" will refer here to the time interval
following birth during which the mortality (or failure) rate decreases. This
definition provides a systems science perspective in which birth constitutes a
sudden transition which falls within the field of application of the ""Transient
Shock"" (TS) conjecture put forward in Richmond et al. (2016c). This conjecture
provides predictions about the timing and shape of the death rate peak. (i) It
says that there will be a death rate spike whenever external conditions change
abruptly and drastically. (ii) It predicts that after a steep rising there will
be a much longer hyperbolic relaxation process. These predictions can be tested
by considering living organisms for which birth is a multi-step process. Thus,
for fish there are three states: egg, yolk-sac phase, young adult. The TS
conjecture predicts a mortality spike at the end of the yolk-sac phase, and
this timing is indeed confirmed by observation. Secondly, the hyperbolic nature
of the relaxation process can be tested using high accuracy Swiss statistics
which give postnatal death rates from one hour after birth up to the age of 10
years. It turns out that since the 19th century despite a great overall
reduction in infant mortality, the shape of the age-specific death rate has
remained basically unchanged. This hyperbolic pattern is not specific to
humans. It can also be found in small primates as recorded in the archives of
zoological gardens. Our ultimate objective is to set up a chain of cases which
starts from simple systems and then moves up step by step to more complex
organisms. The cases discussed here can be seen as initial landmarks.

algorithm to show that visually complex, coiled sequences are a superposition
of two simpler patterns: the body wave dynamics and a head-curvature pulse. We
demonstrate the precise coiled dynamics of an escape response and uncover new
behaviors in spontaneous, large amplitude coils; deep reorientations occur
through classical Omega-shaped postures and also through larger, new postural
excitations which we label here as delta-turns. We find that omega and delta
turns occur independently, the serpentine analog of a random left-right step,
suggesting a distinct triggering mechanism. We also show that omega and delta
turns display approximately equal rates and adapt to food-free conditions on a
similar timescale, a simple strategy to avoid navigational bias.

models in biophysical modeling and computation. The ability of providing
accurate and reliable PB estimation of electrostatic solvation free energy,
$\Delta G_{\text{el}}$, and binding free energy, $\Delta\Delta G_{\text{el}}$,
is of tremendous significance to computational biophysics and biochemistry.
Recently, it has been warned in the literature (Journal of Chemical Theory and
Computation 2013, 9, 3677-3685) that the widely used grid spacing of $0.5$ \AA
$ $ produces unacceptable errors in $\Delta\Delta G_{\text{el}}$ estimation
with the solvent exclude surface (SES). In this work, we investigate the grid
dependence of our PB solver (MIBPB) with SESs for estimating both electrostatic
solvation free energies and electrostatic binding free energies. It is found
that the relative absolute error of $\Delta G_{\text{el}}$ obtained at the grid
spacing of $1.0$ \AA $ $ compared to $\Delta G_{\text{el}}$ at $0.2$ \AA $ $
averaged over 153 molecules is less than 0.2\%. Our results indicate that the
use of grid spacing $0.6$ \AA $ $ ensures accuracy and reliability in
$\Delta\Delta G_{\text{el}}$ calculation. In fact, the grid spacing of $1.1$
\AA $ $ appears to deliver adequate accuracy for high throughput screening.

  Generators"	"  We propose a functional architecture of the adult songbird nucleus HVC in
which the core element is a ""functional syllable unit"" (FSU). In this model,
HVC is organized into FSUs, each of which provides the basis for the production
of one syllable in vocalization. Within each FSU, the inhibitory neuron
population takes one of two operational states: (A) simultaneous firing wherein
all inhibitory neurons fire simultaneously, and (B) competitive firing of the
inhibitory neurons. Switching between these basic modes of activity is
accomplished via changes in the synaptic strengths among the inhibitory
neurons. The inhibitory neurons connect to excitatory projection neurons such
that during state (A) the activity of projection neurons is suppressed, while
during state (B) patterns of sequential firing of projection neurons can occur.
The latter state is stabilized by feedback from the projection to the
inhibitory neurons. Song composition for specific species is distinguished by
the manner in which different FSUs are functionally connected to each other.
  Ours is a computational model built with biophysically based neurons. We
illustrate that many observations of HVC activity are explained by the dynamics
of the proposed population of FSUs, and we identify aspects of the model that
are currently testable experimentally. In addition, and standing apart from the
core features of an FSU, we propose that the transition between modes may be
governed by the biophysical mechanism of neuromodulation.

regional dialects. We suggest that the process of dialect formation is
analogous to the physical process of magnetic domain formation. We take the
coastal breeding grounds of the Puget Sound white crowned sparrow as an
example. Previous field studies suggest that birds of this species learn
multiple songs early in life, and when establishing a territory for the first
time, retain one of these dialects in order to match the majority of their
neighbours. We introduce a simple lattice model of the process, showing that
this matching behaviour can produce single dialect domains provided the death
rate of adult birds is sufficiently low. We relate death rate to thermodynamic
temperature in magnetic materials, and calculate the critical death rate by
analogy with the Ising model. Using parameters consistent with the known
behavior of these birds we show that coastal dialect domain shapes may be
explained by viewing them as low temperature ""stripe states"".

coupled bistable gene circuits as an example, and show that its transition
paths are bifurcating. We then derive a criterion to predict the bifurcation of
transition paths in a generalized coupled bistable system. We confirm the
validity of the theory for the example system by numerical simulation. We also
demonstrate in the example system that, if the steady states of individual gene
circuits are not changed by the coupling, the bifurcation pattern is not
dependent on the number of gene circuits. We further show that the transition
rate exponentially decreases with the number of gene circuits when the
transition path does not bifurcate, while a bifurcation facilitates the
transition by lowering the quasi-potential energy barrier.

exploring rare states of a model by biasing simulations to windows of
coordinate values and then combining the resulting data with physical
weighting. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework that casts the step of
combining the data as an eigenproblem. The advantage to this approach is that
it facilitates error analysis. We discuss how the error scales with the number
of windows. Then, we derive a central limit theorem for averages that are
obtained from umbrella sampling. The central limit theorem suggests an
estimator of the error contributions from individual windows, and we develop a
simple and computationally inexpensive procedure for implementing it. We
demonstrate this estimator for simulations of the alanine dipeptide and show
that it emphasizes low free energy pathways between stable states in comparison
to existing approaches for assessing error contributions. We discuss the
possibility of using the estimator and, more generally, the eigenvector method
for umbrella sampling to guide adaptation of the simulation parameters to
accelerate convergence.

during a variety of behaviors, including working memory and decision making.
Previous network models for sequences and memory emphasized specialized
architectures in which a principled mechanism is pre-wired into their
connectivity. Here we demonstrate that, starting from random connectivity and
modifying a small fraction of connections, a largely disordered recur- rent
network can produce sequences and implement working memory efficiently. We use
this process, called Partial In-Network Training (PINning), to model and match
cellular resolution imaging data from the posterior parietal cortex during a
virtual memory- guided two-alternative forced-choice task. Analysis of the
connectivity reveals that sequences propagate by the cooperation between
recurrent synaptic interactions and external inputs, rather than through
feedforward or asymmetric connections. Together our results suggest that neural
sequences may emerge through learning from largely unstructured network
architectures.

1603.04721	q-bio	q-bio.QM q-bio.NC	"Stochastic resonance controlled upregulation of internal noise after
  hearing loss as a putative correlate of tinnitus-related neuronal
  hyperactivity"	"  Subjective tinnitus (ST) is generally assumed to be a consequence of hearing
loss (HL). In animal studies acoustic trauma can lead to behavioral signs of
ST, in human studies ST patients without increased hearing thresholds were
found to suffer from so called hidden HL. Additionally, ST is correlated with
pathologically increased spontaneous firing rates and neuronal hyperactivity
(NH) along the auditory pathway. Homeostatic plasticity (HP) has been proposed
as a compensation mechanism leading to the development of NH, arguing that
after HL initially decreased mean firing rates of neurons are subsequently
restored by increased spontaneous rates. However all HP models fundamentally
lack explanatory power since the function of keeping mean firing rate constant
remains elusive as does the benefit this might have in terms of information
processing. Furthermore the neural circuitry being able to perform the
comparison of preferred with actual mean firing rate remains unclear. Here we
propose an entirely new interpretation of ST related development of NH in terms
of information theory. We suggest that stochastic resonance (SR) plays a key
role in short- and long-term plasticity within the auditory system and is the
ultimate cause of NH and ST. SR has been found ubiquitous in neuroscience and
refers to the phenomenon that sub-threshold, unperceivable signals can be
transmitted by adding noise to sensor input. We argue that after HL, SR serves
to lift signals above the increased hearing threshold, hence subsequently
decreasing thresholds again. The increased amount of internal noise is the
correlate of the NH, which finally leads to the development of ST, due to
neuronal plasticity along the auditory pathway. We demonstrate the plausibility
of our hypothesis by using a computational model and provide exemplarily
findings of human and animal studies that are consistent with our model.

  Application to T-cells immune response"	"  The progression of a cell population where each individual is characterized
by the value of an internal variable varying with time (e.g. size, weight, and
protein concentration) is typically modeled by a Population Balance Equation, a
first order linear hyperbolic partial differential equation. The
characteristics described by internal variables usually vary monotonically with
the passage of time. A particular difficulty appears when the characteristic
curves exhibit different slopes from each other and therefore cross each other
at certain times. In particular such crossing phenomenon occurs during T-cells
immune response when the concentrations of protein expressions depend upon each
other and also when some global protein (e.g. Interleukin signals) is also
involved which is shared by all T-cells. At these crossing points, the linear
advection equation is not possible by using the classical way of hyperbolic
conservation laws. Therefore, a new Transport Method is introduced in this
article which allowed us to find the population density function for such
processes. The newly developed Transport method (TM) is shown to work in the
case of crossing and to provide a smooth solution at the crossing points in
contrast to the classical PDF techniques.

biology. However, these networks can be hard to infer from experimental data
because of the inherent variability in biological data as well as the large
number of genes involved. We propose a fast, simple method for inferring
regulatory relationships between genes from knockdown experiments in the NIH

  weak electric fields and input filtering mediated by the dendrite"	"  How extracellular electric fields, as generated endogenously or through
transcranial brain stimulation, affect the dynamics of large neuronal
populations is of great interest but not well understood. To study the
collective dynamics of large populations single-compartment (point) model
neurons have been proven very successful. These models, however, lack the
dendritic morphology to biophysically account for the effects of electric
fields, and for changes in synaptic integration due to morphology alone. Here
we (i) characterize the response of a canonical spatial (ball-and-stick) model
neuron to fluctuating synaptic input as well as an oscillatory, weak electric
field, and (ii) analytically derive an extension for popular integrate-and-fire
point neuron models to accurately reproduce these responses. We obtain distinct
filters mediated by the dendrite for inputs at the soma (high-pass filter) or
at the distal dendritic site (low-pass filter), and find that the electric
field induces spike rate resonance in the beta and gamma frequency bands or
even higher frequencies, depending on the location of synaptic background
input. Due to their computational efficiency the extended point models are well
suited for application in large populations of coupled neurons with different
morphology, exposed to extracellular electric fields.

potential for providing insights and thereby, preventing, and treating multiple
neuronal disorders affecting millions of patients. Discovery of relationships,
such as brain connectivity, is a major goal in basic, translational, and
clinical science. Algorithms for causal discovery are used in diverse fields
for tackling problems similar to the task of reconstruction of neuronal brain
connectivity. Our aim is to understand the strengths and limitations of these
methods, measure performance and its determinants, and provide insights to
enhance their performance and applicability. We performed extensive empirical
testing and benchmarking of reconstruction performance of several
state-of-the-art algorithms along with several ensemble techniques used to
combine them. Our experiments used a clear and broadly relevant gold standard
based on calcium fluorescence time series recordings of thousands of neurons
sampled from a previously validated realistic, neuronal model. Correlation,
entropy-based measures, Cross-Correlation for short time lags, and Generalized
Transfer Entropy had the best performances with area under ROC curve (AUC) in
the range of 0.7-0.8 even for smaller sample sizes of n = 100 to 1,000 and
converged quickly (at less than n = 1,000). Ensembles of best-performing
methods using random forests and neural networks generated AUC of ~0.9 with n =
10,000. Several important insights regarding parameter choice and sample size
were gained for guiding the experimental design of studies. Our data are also
supportive of the feasibility of reliably reconstructing complex neuronal
connectivity using existing techniques.

  Metrics for Resource Allocation"	"  A modified, deterministic SEIR model is developed for the 2014 Ebola epidemic
occurring in the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The
model describes the dynamical interaction of susceptible and infected
populations, while accounting for the effects of hospitalization and the spread
of disease through interactions with deceased, but infectious, individuals.
Using data from the World Health Organization (WHO), parameters within the
model are fit to recent estimates of infected and deceased cases from each
nation. The model is then analyzed using these parameter values. Finally,
several metrics are proposed to determine which of these nations is in greatest
need of additional resources to combat the spread of infection. These include
local and global sensitivity metrics of both the infected population and the
basic reproduction number with respect to rates of hospitalization and proper
burial.

1603.05004	q-bio	math.DS q-bio.PE	Robust permanence for ecological maps	"  We consider ecological difference equations of the form $X_{t+1}^i =X_t^i
A_i(X_t)$ where $X_t^i$ is a vector of densities corresponding to the
subpopulations of species $i$ (e.g. subpopulations of different ages or living
in different patches), $X_t=(X_t^1,X_t^2,\dots,X_t^m)$ is state of the entire
community, and $A_i(X_t)$ are matrices determining the update rule for species
$i$. These equations are permanent if they are dissipative and the extinction
set $\{X: \prod_i \|X^i\|=0\}$ is repelling. If permanence persists under
perturbations of the matrices $A_i(X)$, the equations are robustly permanent.
We provide sufficient and necessary conditions for robust permanence in terms
of Lyapunov exponents for invariant measures supported by the extinction set.
Applications to ecological and epidemiological models are given.

1603.05102	q-bio	cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.PE	$\delta$-exceedance records and random adaptive walks	"  We study a modified record process where the $k$'th record in a series of
independent and identically distributed random variables is defined recursively
through the condition $Y_k > Y_{k-1} - \delta_{k-1}$ with a deterministic
sequence $\delta_k > 0$ called the handicap. For constant $\delta_k \equiv
\delta$ and exponentially distributed random variables it has been shown in
previous work that the process displays a phase transition as a function of
$\delta$ between a normal phase where the mean record value increases
indefinitely and a stationary phase where the mean record value remains bounded
and a finite fraction of all entries are records (Park \textit{et al} 2015 {\it
Phys. Rev.} E \textbf{91} 042707). Here we explore the behavior for general
probability distributions and decreasing and increasing sequences $\delta_k$,
focusing in particular on the case when $\delta_k$ matches the typical spacing
between subsequent records in the underlying simple record process without
handicap. We find that a continuous phase transition occurs only in the
exponential case, but a novel kind of first order transition emerges when
$\delta_k$ is increasing. The problem is partly motivated by the dynamics of
evolutionary adaptation in biological fitness landscapes, where $\delta_k$
corresponds to the change of the deterministic fitness component after $k$
mutational steps. The results for the record process are used to compute the
mean number of steps that a population performs in such a landscape before
being trapped at a local fitness maximum.

1603.05261	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Optimally controlling the human connectome: the role of network topology	"  To meet ongoing cognitive demands, the human brain must seamlessly transition
from one brain state to another, in the process drawing on different cognitive
systems. How does the brain's network of anatomical connections help facilitate
such transitions? Which features of this network contribute to making one
transition easy and another transition difficult? Here, we address these
questions using network control theory. We calculate the optimal input signals
to drive the brain to and from states dominated by different cognitive systems.
The input signals allow us to assess the contributions made by different brain
regions. We show that such contributions, which we measure as energy, are
correlated with regions' weighted degrees. We also show that the network
communicability, a measure of direct and indirect connectedness between brain
regions, predicts the extent to which brain regions compensate when input to
another region is suppressed. Finally, we identify optimal states in which the
brain should start (and finish) in order to minimize transition energy. We show
that the optimal target states display high activity in hub regions,
implicating the brain's rich club. Furthermore, when rich club organization is
destroyed, the energy cost associated with state transitions increases
significantly, demonstrating that it is the richness of brain regions that
makes them ideal targets.

1603.05293	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Evolution of worker policing	"  Workers in insect societies are sometimes observed to kill male eggs of other
workers, a phenomenon known as worker policing. We perform a mathematical
analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of policing. We investigate the selective
forces behind policing for both dominant and recessive mutations for different
numbers of matings of the queen. The traditional, relatedness-based argument
suggests that policing evolves if the queen mates with more than two males, but
does not evolve if the queen mates with a single male. We derive precise
conditions for the invasion and stability of policing alleles. We find that the
relatedness-based argument is not robust with respect to small changes in
colony efficiency caused by policing. We also calculate evolutionarily singular
strategies and determine when they are evolutionarily stable. We use a
population genetics approach that applies to dominant or recessive mutations of
any effect size.

with CRISPR associated (CAS) genes, play a profound role in the interactions
between phage and their bacterial hosts. It is now well understood that
CRISPR-CAS systems can confer adaptive immunity against bacteriophage
infections. However, the possibility of failure of CRISPR immunity may lead to
a productive infection by the phage (cell lysis) or lysogeny. Recently,
CRISPR-CAS genes have been implicated in changes to group behaviour, including
biofilm formation, of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa when lysogenized.
For lysogens with a CRISPR system, another recent experimental study suggests
that bacteriophage re-infection of previously lysogenized bacteria may lead to
cell death. Thus CRISPR immunity can have complex effects on phage-host-lysogen
interactions, particularly in a biofilm. In this contribution, we develop and
analyse a series of models to elucidate and disentangle these interactions.
From a therapeutic standpoint, CRISPR immunity increases biofilm resistance to
phage therapy. Our models predict that lysogens may be able to displace
CRISPR-immune bacteria in a biofilm, and thus suggest strategies to eliminate
phage resistant biofilms.

  Testing"	"  The heart is a vital organ that relies on the orchestrated propagation of
electrical stimuli to coordinate each heart beat. Abnormalities in the heart's
electrical behaviour can be managed with a cardiac pacemaker. Recently, the
closed-loop testing of pacemakers with an emulation (real-time simulation) of
the heart has been proposed. An emulated heart would provide realistic
reactions to the pacemaker as if it were a real heart. This enables developers
to interrogate their pacemaker design without having to engage in costly or
lengthy clinical trials. Many high-fidelity heart models have been developed,
but are too computationally intensive to be simulated in real-time. Heart
models, designed specifically for the closed-loop testing of pacemakers, are
too abstract to be useful in the testing of physical pacemakers.
  In the context of pacemaker testing, this paper presents a more
computationally efficient heart model that generates realistic continuous-time
electrical signals. The heart model is composed of cardiac cells that are
connected by paths. Significant improvements were made to an existing cardiac
cell model to stabilise its activation behaviour and to an existing path model
to capture the behaviour of continuous electrical propagation. We provide
simulation results that show our ability to faithfully model complex re-entrant
circuits (that cause arrhythmia) that existing heart models can not.

1603.05319	q-bio	q-bio.QM	Understanding the spatiotemporal pattern of grazing cattle movement	"  In this study, we analyse a high-frequency movement dataset for a group of
grazing cattle and investigate their spatiotemporal patterns using a simple
two-state `stop-and-move' mobility model. We find that the dispersal kernel in
the moving state is best described by a mixture exponential distribution,
indicating the hierarchical nature of the movement. On the other hand, the
waiting time appears to be scale-invariant below a certain cut-off and is best
described by a truncated power-law distribution, suggesting heterogenous
dynamics in the non-moving state. We explore possible explanations for the
observed phenomena, covering factors that can play a role in the generation of
mobility patterns, such as the context of grazing environment, the intrinsic
decision-making mechanism or the energy status of different activities. In
particular, we propose a new hypothesis that the underlying movement pattern
can be attributed to the most probable observable energy status under the
maximum entropy configuration. These results are not only valuable for
modelling cattle movement but also provide new insights for understanding the
underlying biological basis of grazing behaviour.

  quantifying cross-frequency information transactions in the brain"	"  Identifying dynamic transactions between brain regions has become
increasingly important. Measurements within and across brain structures,
demonstrating the occurrence of bursts of beta/gamma oscillations only during
one specific phase of each theta/alpha cycle, have motivated the need to
advance beyond linear and stationary time series models. Here we offer a novel
measure, namely, the ""dual frequency RV-coupling coefficient"", for assessing
different types of frequency-frequency interactions that subserve information
flow in the brain. This is a measure of coherence between two complex-valued
vectors, consisting of the set of Fourier coefficients for two different
frequency bands, within or across two brain regions. RV-coupling is expressed
in terms of instantaneous and lagged components. Furthermore, by using
normalized Fourier coefficients (unit modulus), phase-type couplings can also
be measured. The dual frequency RV-coupling coefficient is based on previous
work: the second order bispectrum, i.e. the dual-frequency coherence (Thomson
1982; Haykin & Thomson 1998); the RV-coefficient (Escoufier 1973); Gorrostieta
et al (2012); and Pascual-Marqui et al (2011). This paper presents the new
measure, and outlines relevant statistical tests. The novel aspects of the
""dual frequency RV-coupling coefficient"" are: (1) it can be applied to two
multivariate time series; (2) the method is not limited to single discrete
frequencies, and in addition, the frequency bands are treated by means of
appropriate multivariate statistical methodology; (3) the method makes use of a
novel generalization of the RV-coefficient for complex-valued multivariate
data; (4) real and imaginary covariance contributions to the RV-coherence are
obtained, allowing the definition of a ""lagged-coupling"" measure that is
minimally affected by the low spatial resolution of estimated cortical electric
neuronal activity.

fields of science, from biology to sociology, as does the R\'enyi entropy,
which measures the diversity of a statistical ensemble. We derive a
mathematical relation between the abundance distribution and the R\'enyi
entropy, by analogy with the equivalence of ensembles in thermodynamics. The
abundance distribution is mapped onto the density of states, and the R\'enyi
entropy to the free energy. The two quantities are related in the thermodynamic
limit by a Legendre transform, by virtue of the equivalence between the
micro-canonical and canonical ensembles. In this limit, we show how the R\'enyi
entropy can be constructed geometrically from rank-frequency plots. This
mapping predicts that non-concave regions of the rank-frequency curve should
result in kinks in the R\'enyi entropy as a function of its order. We
illustrate our results on simple examples, and emphasize the limitations of the
equivalence of ensembles when a thermodynamic limit is not well defined. Our
results help choose reliable diversity measures based on the experimental
accuracy of the abundance distributions in particular frequency ranges.

self-assemble to form a symmetric protein shell called a capsid. This assembly
process is subject to multiple competing constraints, including the need to
form a thermostable shell while avoiding kinetic traps. It has been proposed
that viral assembly satisfies these constraints through allosteric regulation,
including the interconversion of capsid proteins among conformations with
different propensities for assembly. In this article we use computational and
theoretical modeling to explore how such allostery affects the assembly of
icosahedral shells. We simulate assembly under a wide range of protein
concentrations, protein binding affinities, and two different mechanisms of
allosteric control. We find that, above a threshold strength of allosteric
control, assembly becomes robust over a broad range of subunit binding
affinities and concentrations, allowing the formation of highly thermostable
capsids. Our results suggest that allostery can significantly shift the range
of protein binding affinities that lead to successful assembly, and thus should
be accounted for in models that are used to estimate interaction parameters
from experimental data.

1603.05605	q-bio	q-bio.SC math.NA	Multiscale modeling of diffusion in a crowded environment	"  We present a multiscale approach to model diffusion in a crowded environment
and its effect on the reaction rates. Diffusion in biological systems is often
modeled by a discrete space jump process in order to capture the inherent noise
of biological systems, which becomes important in the low copy number regime.
To model diffusion in the crowded cell environment efficiently, we compute the
jump rates in this mesoscopic model from local first exit times, which account
for the microscopic positions of the crowding molecules, while the diffusing
molecules jump on a coarser Cartesian grid. We then extract a macroscopic
description from the resulting jump rates, where the excluded volume effect is
modeled by a diffusion equation with space dependent diffusion coefficient. The
crowding molecules can be of arbitrary shape and size and numerical experiments
demonstrate that those factors together with the size of the diffusing molecule
play a crucial role on the magnitude of the decrease in diffusive motion. When
correcting the reaction rates for the altered diffusion we can show that
molecular crowding either enhances or inhibits chemical reactions depending on
local fluctuations of the obstacle density.

central ones, i.e. hubs, playing key functional roles in cerebral
inter-regional interactions. Studies have shown that networks, obtained from
the analysis of specific frequency components of brain activity, present
peculiar architectures with unique profiles of region centrality. However, the
identification of hubs in networks built from different frequency bands
simultaneously is still a challenging problem, remaining largely unexplored.
Here we identify each frequency component with one layer of a multiplex network
and face this challenge by exploiting the recent advances in the analysis of
multiplex topologies. First, we show that each frequency band carries unique
topological information, fundamental to accurately model brain functional
networks. We then demonstrate that hubs in the multiplex network, in general
different from those ones obtained after discarding or aggregating the measured
signals as usual, provide a more accurate map of brain's most important
functional regions, allowing to distinguish between healthy and schizophrenic
populations better than conventional network approaches.

phenomena, including those in theoretical genetics, evolutionary game theory,
or in the theories of the origin of life. Among other questions, the permanence
of the replicator equation is well studied in the local, well-mixed case.
Inasmuch as the spatial heterogeneities are key to understanding the species
coexistence at least in some cases, it is important to supplement the classical
theory of the non-distributed replicator equation with a spatially explicit
framework. One possible approach, motivated by the porous medium equation, is
introduced. It is shown that the solutions to the spatially heterogeneous
replicator equation may evolve to equilibrium states that have a bounded
support, and, moreover, that these solutions are of paramount importance for
the overall system permanence, which is shown to be a more commonplace
phenomenon for the spatially explicit equation if compared with the local
model.

Some indices are partly insensitive to distinguish the quality of case-finding.
The incidence based indices perform well. If possible, incidence based indices

interpretation of events in subthreshold electrophysiological recordings. This
problem is non-trivial because recordings may have moderate levels of
structured noise and events may have distinct kinetics. In addition, novel
experimental designs that combine optical and electrophysiological methods will
depend upon statistical tools that combine multimodal data. We present a
Bayesian approach for inferring the timing, strength, and kinetics of
postsynaptic currents (PSCs) from voltage-clamp recordings on a per event
basis. The simple generative model for a single voltage-clamp recording
flexibly extends to include network-level structure to enable experiments
designed to probe synaptic connectivity. We validate the approach on simulated
and real data. We also demonstrate that extensions of the basic PSC detection
algorithm can handle recordings contaminated with optically evoked currents,
and we simulate a scenario in which calcium imaging observations, available for
a subset of neurons, can be fused with electrophysiological data to achieve
higher temporal resolution. We apply this approach to simulated and real ground
truth data to demonstrate its higher sensitivity in detecting small
signal-to-noise events and its increased robustness to noise compared to
standard methods for detecting PSCs. The new Bayesian event analysis approach
for electrophysiological recordings should allow for better estimation of
physiological parameters under more variable conditions and help support new
experimental designs for circuit mapping.

1603.06335	q-bio	q-bio.BM	Asymptotics of Stochastic Protein Assembly Models	"  Self-assembly of proteins is a biological phenomenon which gives rise to
spontaneous formation of amyloid fibrils or polymers. The starting point of
this phase, called nucleation exhibits an important variability among
replicated experiments.To analyse the stochastic nature of this phenomenon, one
of the simplest models considers two populations of chemical components:
monomers and polymerised monomers. Initially there are only monomers. There are
two reactions for the polymerization of a monomer: either two monomers collide
to combine into two polymerised monomers or a monomer is polymerised after the
encounter of a polymerised monomer. It turns out that this simple model does
not explain completely the variability observed in the experiments. This paper
investigates extensions of this model to take into account other mechanisms of
the polymerization process that may have impact an impact on fluctuations.The
first variant consists in introducing a preliminary conformation step to take
into account the biological fact that, before being polymerised, a monomer has
two states, regular or misfolded. Only misfolded monomers can be polymerised so
that the fluctuations of the number of misfolded monomers can be also a source
of variability of the number of polymerised monomers. The second variant
represents the reaction rate $\alpha$ of spontaneous formation of a polymer as
of the order of $N^{-\nu}$, with $\nu$ some positive constant. First and second
order results for the starting instant of nucleation are derived from these
limit theorems. The proofs of the results rely on a study of a stochastic
averaging principle for a model related to an Ehrenfest urn model, and also on
a scaling analysis of a population model.

  functional neuroimaging investigations"	"  Meditation is a family of mental practices that encompasses a wide array of
techniques employing distinctive mental strategies. We systematically reviewed
78 functional neuroimaging (fMRI and PET) studies of meditation, and used
activation likelihood estimation to meta-analyze 257 peak foci from 31
experiments involving 527 participants. We found reliably dissociable patterns
of brain activation and deactivation for four common styles of meditation
(focused attention, mantra recitation, open monitoring, and
compassion/loving-kindness), and suggestive differences for three others
(visualization, sense-withdrawal, and non-dual awareness practices). Overall,
dissociable activation patterns are congruent with the psychological and
behavioral aims of each practice. Some brain areas are recruited consistently
across multiple techniques - including insula, pre/supplementary motor
cortices, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and frontopolar cortex - but
convergence is the exception rather than the rule. A preliminary effect-size
meta-analysis found medium effects for both activations (d = .59) and
deactivations (d = -.74), suggesting potential practical significance. Our
meta-analysis supports the neurophysiological dissociability of meditation
practices, but also raises many methodological concerns and suggests avenues
for future research.

1603.06353	q-bio	cs.NE math.OC q-bio.NC	A Discontinuous Neural Network for Non-Negative Sparse Approximation	"  This paper investigates a discontinuous neural network which is used as a
model of the mammalian olfactory system and can more generally be applied to
solve non-negative sparse approximation problems. By inherently limiting the
systems integrators to having non-negative outputs, the system function becomes
discontinuous since the integrators switch between being inactive and being
active. It is shown that the presented network converges to equilibrium points
which are solutions to general non-negative least squares optimization
problems. We specify a Caratheodory solution and prove that the network is
stable, provided that the system matrix has full column-rank. Under a mild
condition on the equilibrium point, we show that the network converges to its
equilibrium within a finite number of switches. Two applications of the neural
network are shown. Firstly, we apply the network as a model of the olfactory
system and show that in principle it may be capable of performing complex
sparse signal recovery tasks. Secondly, we generalize the application to
include non-negative sparse approximation problems and compare the recovery
performance to a classical non-negative basis pursuit denoising algorithm. We
conclude that the recovery performance differs only marginally from the
classical algorithm, while the neural network has the advantage that no
performance critical regularization parameter has to be chosen prior to
recovery.

or mathematical theories are sufficient to understand the complexities of human
brain when it interacts with the external environment in the form of an
auditory stimulus.There have been efforts reporting that the introduction of
ambiguity in visual stimuli causes effects which can't be explained
classically.In this paper,it is investigated whether ambiguity in auditory
stimuli can introduce any non-classical effects in human brain.Simple
experiments were performed on normal subjects where they listened to an
ambiguous auditory signal and responded to a question with 'yes' or 'no'.The
outcome of the test showed that the classical formula of total probability does
not hold true in this case.Results were interesting and indicate that there is
a definite non-classicality in mental states in perception of ambiguous audio
stimuli.

which it moves. This substrate provides its only resource, and the forager
manage it by taking a limited portion at each visited site. The resource
recovers its value after the visit following a relaxation law. We study
different scenarios to analyze the efficiency of the managing strategy,
corresponding to control the bite size. We observe the non trivial emergence of
a home range, that is visited in a periodic way. The duration of the
corresponding cycles and the transient until it emerges is affected by the bite
size. Our results show that the most efficient use of the resource, measured as
the balance between gathering and travelled distance, corresponds to foragers
that take larger portions but without exhausting the resource. We also analyze
the use of space determining the number of attractors of the dynamics, and we
observe that it depends on the bite size and the recovery time of the resource.

deep learning in bioinformatics to gain insight from data has been emphasized
in both academia and industry. Here, we review deep learning in bioinformatics,

measure in vivo but essential for a quantitative understanding of evolution.
Using whole genome deep sequencing data from longitudinal samples during
untreated HIV-1 infection, we estimated mutation rates and fitness costs in
HIV-1 from the temporal dynamics of genetic variation. At approximately neutral
sites, mutations accumulate with a rate of 1.2 x 10^-5 per site per day, in
agreement with the rate measured in cell cultures. The rate from G to A is
largest, followed by the other transitions C to T, T to C, and A to G, while
transversions are more rare. At non-neutral sites, most mutations reduce virus
replication; using a model of mutation selection balance, we estimated the
fitness cost of mutations at every site in the HIV-1 genome. About half of all
nonsynonymous mutations have large fitness costs (greater than 10\%), while
most synonymous mutations have costs below 1\%. The cost of synonymous
mutations is especially low in most of gag and pol, while much higher costs are
observed in important RNA structures and regulatory regions. The intrapatient
fitness cost estimates are consistent across multiple patients, suggesting that
the deleterious part of the fitness landscape is universal and explains a large
fraction of global HIV-1 group M diversity.

spontaneous oscillations upon coupling. On varying the coupling strength a

  using heat kernels"	"  Network theory provides a principled abstraction of the human brain: reducing
a complex system into a simpler representation from which to investigate brain
organisation. Recent advancement in the neuroimaging field are towards
representing brain connectivity as a dynamic process in order to gain a deeper
understanding of how the brain is organised for information transport. In this
paper we propose a network modelling approach based on the heat kernel to
capture the process of heat diffusion in complex networks. By applying the heat
kernel to structural brain networks, we define new features which quantify
change in energy flow. Identifying suitable features which can classify
networks between cohorts is useful towards understanding the effect of disease
on brain architecture. We demonstrate the discriminative power of heat kernel
features in both synthetic and clinical preterm data. By generating an
extensive range of synthetic networks with varying density and randomisation,
we investigate how heat flows in the networks in relation to changes in network
topology. We demonstrate that our proposed features provide a metric of network
efficiency and may be indicative of organisational principles commonly
associated with, for example, small-world architecture. In addition, we show
the potential of these features to characterise and classify between network
topologies. We further demonstrate our methodology in a clinical setting by
applying it to a large cohort of preterm babies scanned at term equivalent age
from which diffusion networks were computed. We show that our heat kernel
features are able to successfully predict motor function measured at two years
of age (sensitivity, specificity, F-score, accuracy = 75.0, 82.5, 78.6, 82.3%,
respectively.

1603.06879	q-bio	q-bio.NC	A Unifying Framework for the Identification of Motor Primitives	"  A long-standing hypothesis in neuroscience is that the central nervous system
accomplishes complex motor behaviors through the combination of a small number
of motor primitives. Many studies in the last couples of decades have
identified motor primitives at the kinematic, kinetic, and electromyographic
level, thus supporting modularity at different levels of organization in the
motor system. However, these studies relied on heterogeneous definitions of
motor primitives and on different algorithms for their identification. Standard
unsupervised learning algorithms such as principal component analysis,
independent component analysis, and non-negative matrix factorization, or more
advanced techniques involving the estimation of temporal delays of the relevant
mixture components have been applied. This plurality of algorithms has made
difficult to compare and interpret results obtained across different studies.
Moreover, how the different definitions of motor primitives relate to each
other has never been examined systematically. Here we propose a comprehensive
framework for the definition of different types of motor primitives and a
single algorithm for their identification. By embedding smoothness priors and
specific constraints in the underlying generative model, the algorithm can
identify many different types of motor primitives. We assessed the
identification performance of the algorithm both on simulated data sets, for
which the properties of the primitives and of the corresponding combination
parameters were known, and on experimental electromyographic and kinematic data
sets, collected from human subjects accomplishing goal-oriented and rhythmic
motor tasks. The identification accuracy of the new algorithm was typically
equal or better than the accuracy of other unsupervised learning algorithms
used previously for the identification of the same types of primitives.

  From Local to Global Quorum Sensing"	"  Bacteria communicate using external chemical signals called autoinducers (AI)
in a process known as quorum sensing (QS). QS efficiency is reduced by both
limitations of AI diffusion and potential interference from neighboring
strains. There is thus a need for predictive theories of how spatial community
structure shapes information processing in complex microbial ecosystems. As a
step in this direction, we apply a reaction-diffusion model to study
autoinducer signaling dynamics in a single-species community as a function of
the spatial distribution of colonies in the system. We predict a dynamical
transition between a local quorum sensing (LQS) regime, with the AI signaling
dynamics primarily controlled by the local population densities of individual
colonies, and a global quorum sensing (GQS) regime, with the dynamics being
dependent on collective inter-colony diffusive interactions. The crossover
between LQS to GQS is intimately connected to a tradeoff between the signaling
network's latency, or speed of activation, and its throughput, or the total
spatial range over which all the components of the system communicate.

  by a novel sliding window algorithm"	"  Proteomic matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation (MALDI) linear
time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) may be used to produce protein
profiles from biological samples with the aim of discovering biomarkers for
disease. However, the raw protein profiles suffer from several sources of bias
or systematic variation which need to be removed via pre-processing before
meaningful downstream analysis of the data can be undertaken. Baseline
subtraction, an early pre-processing step that removes the non-peptide signal
from the spectra, is complicated by the following: (i) each spectrum has, on
average, wider peaks for peptides with higher mass-to-charge ratios (m/z), and
(ii) the time-consuming and error-prone trial-and-error process for optimising
the baseline subtraction input arguments. With reference to the aforementioned
complications, we present an automated pipeline that includes (i) a novel
`continuous' line segment algorithm that efficiently operates over data with a
transformed m/z-axis to remove the relationship between peptide mass and peak
width, and (ii) an input-free algorithm to estimate peak widths on the
transformed m/z scale. The automated baseline subtraction method was deployed
on six publicly available proteomic MS datasets using six different m/z-axis
transformations. Optimality of the automated baseline subtraction pipeline was
assessed quantitatively using the mean absolute scaled error (MASE) when
compared to a gold-standard baseline subtracted signal. Near-optimal baseline
subtraction was achieved using the automated pipeline. The advantages of the
proposed pipeline include informed and data specific input arguments for
baseline subtraction methods, the avoidance of time-intensive and subjective
piecewise baseline subtraction, and the ability to automate baseline
subtraction completely. Moreover, individual steps can be adopted as
stand-alone routines.

  oligoglycine in water"	"  Protein solubility and conformational stability are a result of a balance of
interactions both within a protein and between protein and solvent. The
electrostatic solvation free energy of oligoglycines, models for the peptide
backbone, becomes more favorable with an increasing length, yet longer peptides
collapse due to the formation of favorable intrapeptide interactions between CO
dipoles, in some cases without hydrogen bonds. The strongly repulsive solvent
cavity formation is balanced by van der Waals attractions and electrostatic
contributions. In order to investigate the competition between solvent
exclusion and charge interactions we simulate the collapse of a long
oligoglycine comprised of 15 residues while scaling the charges on the peptide
from zero to fully charged. We examine the effect this has on the
conformational properties of the peptide. We also describe the approximate
thermodynamic changes that occur during the scaling both in terms of
intrapeptide potentials and peptide-water potentials, and estimate the
electrostatic solvation free energy of the system.

  Graph Topology"	"  Emerging brain network studies suggest that interactions between various

topological structure. Many brain diseases are associated with altered
topological patterns of brain connectivity. Therefore, a key inquiry of
connectivity analysis is to identify network-level differentially expressed
connections that have low false positive rates, sufficient statistical power,
and high reproducibility. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical
approach to fulfill this goal by leveraging the topological structure of
differentially expressed functional connections or edges in a graphical
representation. We propose a new algorithm to automatically detect the latent
topology of a k-partite graph structure, and we also provide statistical
inferential techniques to test the detected topology. We evaluate our new
methods via extensive numerical studies. We also apply our new approach to
resting state fMRI data (24 cases and 18 controls) for Parkinson's disease
research. The detected connectivity network biomaker with the k-partite graph
topological structure reveals underlying neural features distinguishing
Parkinson's disease patients from healthy control subjects.

measuring dynamic speckle intensity patterns reflected from samples and

1603.07540	q-bio	math.DS q-bio.PE q-bio.TO	A multiscale mathematical model of tumour invasive growth	"  Known as one of the hallmarks of cancer [30], cancer cell invasion of human
body tissue is a complicated spatio-temporal multiscale process which enables a
localised solid tumour to transform into a systemic, metastatic and fatal
disease. This process explores and takes advantage of the reciprocal relation
that solid tumours establish with the extracellular matrix (ECM) components and
other multiple distinct cell types from the surrounding microenvironment.
Through the secretion of various proteolytic enzymes such as matrix
metalloproteinases (MMP) or the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), the
cancer cell population alters the configuration of the surrounding ECM
composition and overcomes the physical barriers to ultimately achieve local
cancer spread into the surrounding tissue. The active interplay between the
tissue-scale tumour dynamics and the molecular mechanics of the involved
proteolytic enzymes at the cell-scale underlines the biologically multiscale
character of invasion, and raises the challenge of modelling this process with
an appropriate multiscale approach. In this paper, we present a new two-scale
moving boundary model of cancer invasion that explores the tissue scale tumour
dynamics in conjunction with the molecular dynamics of the urokinase
plasminogen activation system. Building on the multiscale moving boundary
method proposed in [58], the modelling that we propose here allows us to study
the changes in tissue scale tumour morphology caused by the cell-scale uPA
micro-dynamics occurring along the invasive edge of the tumour. Our
computational simulation results demonstrate a range of heterogeneous dynamics
which are qualitatively similar to the invasive growth patterns observed in a
number of different types of cancer, such as the tumour infiltrative growth
patterns discussed in [33].

1603.07617	q-bio	math.CA q-bio.QM	"Reconstruction algorithms for a class of restricted ray transforms
  without added singularities"	"  Let $X$ and $X^*$ denote a restricted ray transform along curves and a
corresponding backprojection operator, respectively. Theoretical analysis of
reconstruction from the data $Xf$ is usually based on a study of the
composition $X^* D X$, where $D$ is some local operator (usually a derivative).
If $X^*$ is chosen appropriately, then $X^* D X$ is a Fourier Integral Operator
(FIO) with singular symbol. The singularity of the symbol leads to the
appearance of artifacts (added singularities) that can be as strong as the
original (or, useful) singularities. By choosing $D$ in a special way one can
reduce the strength of added singularities, but it is impossible to get rid of
them completely.
  In the paper we follow a similar approach, but make two changes. First, we
replace $D$ with a nonlocal operator $\tilde D$ that integrates $Xf$ along a
curve in the data space. The result $\tilde D Xf$ resembles the generalized
Radon transform $R$ of $f$. The function $\tilde D Xf$ is defined on pairs
$(x_0,\Theta)\in U\times S^2$, where $U\subset\mathbb R^3$ is an open set
containing the support of $f$, and $S^2$ is the unit sphere in $\mathbb R^3$.
Second, we replace $X^*$ with a backprojection operator $R^*$ that integrates
with respect to $\Theta$ over $S^2$. It turns out that if $\tilde D$ and $R^*$
are appropriately selected, then the composition $R^* \tilde D X$ is an
elliptic pseudodifferential operator of order zero with principal symbol 1.
Thus, we obtain an approximate reconstruction formula that recovers all the
singularities correctly and does not produce artifacts. The advantage of our
approach is that by inserting $\tilde D$ we get access to the frequency
variable $\Theta$. In particular, we can incorporate suitable cut-offs in $R^*$
to eliminate bad directions $\Theta$, which lead to added singularities.

dissipation is a fundamental engineering design goal. Also, biological systems
achieve remarkable speed, precision and power efficiency using poorly

theory and thermodynamics do not provide general limits on power, precision and
speed. Here we go beyond these classical theories to prove that the product of
precision and speed is universally bounded by power dissipation in any physical
communication channel whose dynamics is faster than that of the signal.
Moreover, our derivation involves a novel connection between friction and
information geometry. These results may yield insight into both the engineering

first few recalls empty working memory (narrowly defined) and a second stage, a
reactivation stage, concludes the recall (Tarnow, 2015). It was also shown that
the serial position curve changes in mild Alzheimer's disease, lowered total
recall and lessened primacy, are similar to second stage recall and different
from recall from working memory. The Tarnow Unchunkable Test (TUT, Tarnow,
2013) uses double integer items to separate out only the first stage, the
emptying of working memory, by making it difficult to reactivate items due to
the lack of intra-item relationships. Here it is shown that subject TUT selects
out diagnosed Alzheimer's Disease but not MCI. On average, diagnosed
Alzheimer's Disease is correlated with a loss of 0.7 memory slots (out of an
average of 2.7 slots). The identification of a lost memory slot may have
implications for improved stage definitions of Alzheimer's disease and for
remediation therapy via working memory capacity management. In conjunction with
the Alzheimer's disease process map, it may also be useful to identify the
exact location of working memory.

information spreading within the population, which is fully connected or
covering a square grid. We assume that a fraction of the population wants to
make the choice of the majority, while the rest want to make the minority
choice. This resembles opinion spreading with ""contrarian"" agents, but has the
game theoretic aspect that agents try to optimize their own situation in ways
that are incompatible with the common good. When this fraction is less than
1/2, the population can efficiently self-organize to a state where agents get
what they want -- the majority (i.e. the majority seekers) have one opinion,
the minority seekers have the other. If the fraction is larger than 1/2, there
is a frustration in the population that dramatically changes the dynamics. In
this region, the population converges, through some distinct phases, to a state
of approximately equal-sized opinions. Just over the threshold the state of the
population is furthest from the collectively optimal solution.

  Single Motor Mutations"	"  Intracellular transport is an essential function in eucaryotic cells,
facilitated by motor proteins - proteins converting chemical energy into
kinetic energy. It is known that motor proteins work in teams enabling
unidirectional and bidirectional transport of intracellular cargo over long
distances. Disruptions of the underlying transport mechanisms, often caused by
mutations that alter single motor characteristics, are known to cause
neurodegenerative diseases. For example, phosphorylation of kinesin motor
domain at the serine residue is implicated in Huntington's disease, with a
recent study of phosphorylated and phosphomimetic serine residues indicating
lowered single motor stalling forces. In this article we report the effects of
mutations of this nature on transport properties of cargo carried by multiple
wild-type and mutant motors. Results indicate that mutants with altered stall
forces might determine the average velocity and run-length even when they are
outnumbered by wild type motors in the ensemble. It is shown that mutants gain
a competitive advantage and lead to an increase in expected run-length when
load on the cargo is in the vicinity of the mutant's stalling force or a
multiple of its stalling force. A separate contribution of this article is the
development of a semi-analytic method to analyze transport of cargo by multiple
motors of multiple types. The technique determines transition rates between
various relative configurations of motors carrying the cargo using the
transition rates between various absolute configurations. This enables exact
computation of average velocity and run-length. It can also be used to
introduce alterations of various single motor parameters to model a mutation
and to deduce effects of such alterations on the transport of a common cargo by
multiple motors. Our method is easily implementable and we provide a software
package for general use.

  epigenomic studies"	"  Motivation: DNA methylation is an intensely studied epigenetic mark, yet its
functional role is incompletely understood. Attempts to quantitatively
associate average DNA methylation to gene expression yield poor correlations
outside of the well-understood methylation-switch at CpG islands.
  Results: Here we use probabilistic machine learning to extract higher order
features associated with the methylation profile across a defined region. These
features quantitate precisely notions of shape of a methylation profile,
capturing spatial correlations in DNA methylation across genomic regions. Using
these higher order features across promoter-proximal regions, we are able to
construct a powerful machine learning predictor of gene expression,
significantly improving upon the predictive power of average DNA methylation
levels. Furthermore, we can use higher order features to cluster
promoter-proximal regions, showing that five major patterns of methylation
occur at promoters across different cell lines, and we provide evidence that
methylation beyond CpG islands may be related to regulation of gene expression.
Our results support previous reports of a functional role of spatial
correlations in methylation patterns, and provide a mean to quantitate such
features for downstream analyses.

1603.08432	q-bio	q-bio.NC cs.DS math.AT	Quantifying topological invariants of neuronal morphologies	"  Nervous systems are characterized by neurons displaying a diversity of
morphological shapes. Traditionally, different shapes have been qualitatively
described based on visual inspection and quantitatively described based on
morphometric parameters. Neither process provides a solid foundation for
categorizing the various morphologies, a problem that is important in many
fields. We propose a stable topological measure as a standardized descriptor
for any tree-like morphology, which encodes its skeletal branching anatomy.
More specifically it is a barcode of the branching tree as determined by a
spherical filtration centered at the root or neuronal soma. This Topological
Morphology Descriptor (TMD) allows for the discrimination of groups of random
and neuronal trees at linear computational cost.

to study the spatial population dynamics of microorganisms. However, natural
populations such as marine microbes experience fluid advection and often grow
up in heterogeneous environments. We investigate a generalized
Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov (FKPP) equation describing single species
population subject to a constant flow field and quenched random spatially
inhomogeneous growth rates with a fertile overall growth condition. We
analytically and numerically demonstrate that the non-equilibrium steady-state
population density develops a flow-driven striation pattern. The striations are
highly asymmetric with a longitudinal correlation length that diverges linearly
with the flow speed and a transverse correlation length that approaches a
finite velocity-independent value. Linear response theory is developed to study
the statistics of the steady states. Theoretical predictions show excellent
agreement with the numerical steady states of the generalized FKPP equation
obtained from Lattice Boltzmann simulations. These findings suggest that,
although the growth disorder can be spatially uncorrelated, correlated
population structures with striations emerge naturally at sufficiently strong
advection.

  Quadratic Time"	"  In phylogenetics, phylogenetic trees are rooted binary trees, whereas
phylogenetic networks are rooted arbitrary acyclic digraphs. Edges are directed
away from the root and leaves are uniquely labeled with taxa in phylogenetic
networks. For the purpose of validating evolutionary models, biologists check
whether or not a phylogenetic tree is contained in a phylogenetic network on
the same taxa. This tree containment problem is known to be NP-complete. A
phylogenetic network is reticulation-visible if every reticulation node
separates the root of the network from some leaves. We answer an open problem
by proving that the problem is solvable in quadratic time for
reticulation-visible networks. The key tool used in our answer is a powerful
decomposition theorem. It also allows us to design a linear-time algorithm for
the cluster containment problem for networks of this type and to prove that
every galled network with n leaves has 2(n-1) reticulation nodes at most.

make a choice between differentiation and apoptosis. This choice is based on
the values of intracellular proteins whose concentrations are described by a
system of ordinary differential equations with bistable dynamics. Intracellular
regulation and cell fate are controlled by the extracellular regulation through
the number of differentiated cells. Initial intracellular protein
concentrations are considered for each cell as random variables with a given
area of variation. Intracellular regulation, extracellular regulation and
random initial conditions work together to produce differentiated cells and to
control their number. The role of intracellular regulation is to provide a
possible choice between differentiation and apoptosis, extracellular regulation
controls the number of differentiated cells, stochastic initial conditions can
suppress oscillations and provide stability of the system.

  Importance Sampling"	"  In statistical genetics an important task involves building predictive models
for the genotype-phenotype relationships and thus attribute a proportion of the
total phenotypic variance to the variation in genotypes. Numerous models have
been proposed to incorporate additive genetic effects into models for
prediction or association. However, there is a scarcity of models that can
adequately account for gene by gene or other forms of genetical interactions.
In addition, there is an increased interest in using marker annotations in
genome-wide prediction and association. In this paper, we discuss an hybrid
modeling methodology which combines the parametric mixed modeling approach and
the non-parametric rule ensembles. This approach gives us a flexible class of
models that can be used to capture additive, locally epistatic genetic effects,
gene x background interactions and allows us to incorporate one or more
annotations into the genomic selection or association models. We use benchmark
data sets covering a range of organisms and traits in addition to simulated
data sets to illustrate the strengths of this approach. The improvement of
model accuracies and association results suggest that a part of the ""missing
heritability"" in complex traits can be captured by modeling local epistasis.

1603.08819	q-bio	cs.DS q-bio.GN	"The SCJ small parsimony problem for weighted gene adjacencies (Extended
  version)"	"  Reconstructing ancestral gene orders in a given phylogeny is a classical
problem in comparative genomics. Most existing methods compare conserved
features in extant genomes in the phylogeny to define potential ancestral gene
adjacencies, and either try to reconstruct all ancestral genomes under a global
evolutionary parsimony criterion, or, focusing on a single ancestral genome,
use a scaffolding approach to select a subset of ancestral gene adjacencies,
generally aiming at reducing the fragmentation of the reconstructed ancestral
genome. In this paper, we describe an exact algorithm for the Small Parsimony
Problem that combines both approaches. We consider that gene adjacencies at
internal nodes of the species phylogeny are weighted, and we introduce an
objective function defined as a convex combination of these weights and the
evolutionary cost under the Single-Cut-or-Join (SCJ) model. The weights of
ancestral gene adjacencies can e.g. be obtained through the recent availability
of ancient DNA sequencing data, which provide a direct hint at the genome
structure of the considered ancestor, or through probabilistic analysis of gene
adjacencies evolution. We show the NP-hardness of our problem variant and
propose a Fixed-Parameter Tractable algorithm based on the Sankoff-Rousseau
dynamic programming algorithm that also allows to sample co-optimal solutions.
We apply our approach to mammalian and bacterial data providing different
degrees of complexity. We show that including adjacency weights in the
objective has a significant impact in reducing the fragmentation of the
reconstructed ancestral gene orders.

application to the most important RNA tetraloops. The method is based on the
idea that ensembles of three-dimensional fragments extracted from
high-resolution crystal structures are heterogeneous enough to describe
metastable as well as intermediate states. These ensembles are first validated
by performing a quantitative comparison against available solution NMR data of
a set of RNA tetranucleotides. Notably, the agreement is better with respect to
the one obtained by comparing NMR with extensive all-atom molecular dynamics
simulations. We then propose a procedure based on diffusion maps and Markov
models that makes it possible to obtain reaction pathways and their relative
probabilities from fragment ensembles. This approach is applied to study the
helix-to-loop folding pathway of all the tetraloops from the GNRA and UNCG
families. The results give detailed insights into the folding mechanism that
are compatible with available experimental data and clarify the role of
intermediate states observed in previous simulation studies. The method is
computationally inexpensive and can be used to study arbitrary conformational
transitions.

  using Deep Recurrent Neural Networks"	"  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short sequences of ribonucleic acids that control the
expression of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by binding them. Robust prediction
of miRNA-mRNA pairs is of utmost importance in deciphering gene regulations but
has been challenging because of high false positive rates, despite a deluge of
computational tools that normally require laborious manual feature extraction.
This paper presents an end-to-end machine learning framework for miRNA target
prediction. Leveraged by deep recurrent neural networks-based auto-encoding and
sequence-sequence interaction learning, our approach not only delivers an
unprecedented level of accuracy but also eliminates the need for manual feature
extraction. The performance gap between the proposed method and existing
alternatives is substantial (over 25% increase in F-measure), and deepTarget
delivers a quantum leap in the long-standing challenge of robust miRNA target
prediction.

1603.09397	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Explaining the geographic origins of seasonal influenza A (H3N2)	"  Most antigenically novel and evolutionarily successful strains of seasonal
influenza A (H3N2) originate in East, South, and Southeast Asia. To understand
this pattern, we simulated the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of
influenza in a host metapopulation representing the temperate north, tropics,
and temperate south. Although seasonality and air traffic are frequently used
to explain global migratory patterns of influenza, we find that other factors
may have a comparable or greater impact. Notably, a region's basic reproductive
number ($R_0$) strongly affects the antigenic evolution of its viral population
and the probability that its strains will spread and fix globally: a 17-28%
higher $R_0$ in one region can explain the observed patterns. Seasonality, in
contrast, increases the probability that a tropical (less seasonal) population
will export evolutionarily successful strains but alone does not predict that
these strains will be antigenically advanced. The relative sizes of different
host populations, their birth and death rates, and the region in which H3N2
first appears affect influenza's phylogeography in different but relatively
minor ways. These results suggest general principles that dictate the spatial
dynamics of antigenically evolving pathogens and offer predictions for how
changes in human ecology might affect influenza evolution.

1603.09415	q-bio	q-bio.PE	WiSPA: A new approach for dealing with widespread parasitism	"  Traditionally, studies of coevolving systems have considered cases where a
parasite may inhabit only a single host. The case where a parasite may infect
many hosts, widespread parasitism, has until recently gained little traction.
This is due in part to the computational complexity involved in reconstructing
the coevolutionary histories where parasites may infect only a single host,
which is NP-Hard. Allowing parasites to inhabit more than one host has been
seen to only further compound this computationally intractable problem.
Recently however, well-established algorithms for estimating the problem
instance where a parasite may infect only a single host have been extended to
handle widespread parasites. Although this has offered significant progress, it
has been noted that these algorithms poorly handle parasites that inhabit
phylogenetically distant hosts.
  In this work we extend these previous algorithms to handle cases where
parasites inhabit phylogenetically distant hosts using an additional
evolutionary event which we call spread. Our new framework is shown to infer
significantly more congruent coevolutionary histories compared to existing
methods over both synthetic and biological data sets. We then apply the newly
proposed algorithm, which we call WiSPA (WideSpread Parasitism Analyser), to
the well studied coevolutionary system of Primates and Enterobius (pinworms),
where existing methods have been unable to reconcile the widespread parasitism
present without permitting additional divergence events. Using WiSPA and the
new biological event, spread, we provide the first statistically significant
coevolutionary hypothesis for this system.

specific and structured manner. Networks can be used to model brain functional
activities constituting a way to characterize and quantify this structured form
of organization. Reports state that different physiological states or even
diseases that affect the central nervous system may be associated to
alterations on those networks, that might reflect in graphs of different
architectures. However, the relation of their structure to different states or
conditions of the organism is not well comprehended. Thus, experiments that
involve the estimation of functional neural networks of subjects exposed to
different controlled conditions are of great relevance. Within this context,
this research has sought to model large scale functional brain networks during
an anesthetic induction process. The experiment was based on intra-cranial
recordings of neural activities of an old world macaque of the species Macaca
fuscata. Neural activity was recorded during a Ketamine-Medetomidine anesthetic
induction process. Networks were serially estimated in time intervals of five
seconds. Changes were observed in various networks properties within about one
and a half minutes after the administration of the anesthetics. These changes
reveal the occurrence of a transition on the networks architecture. During
general anesthesia a reduction in the functional connectivity and network
integration capabilities were verified in both local and global levels. It was
also observed that the brain shifted to a highly specific and dynamic state.
The results bring empirical evidence and report the relation of the induced
state of anesthesia to properties of functional networks, thus, they contribute
for the elucidation of some new aspects of neural correlates of consciousness.

order to understand the dynamics of honey bee colonies we present a discrete
time marked renewal process model for the size of a colony. We demonstrate that
under mild conditions this attains a stationary distribution that depends on
the distribution of the numbers of eggs per batch, the probability an egg

This allows an analytic examination of the effect of changing these quantities.
We then extend this model to cyclic annual effects where for example the

surprisingly little genetic diversity, we demonstrate astonishing amounts of
cultural diversity. Perhaps most impressive is the diversity of our
technologies, broadly defined as all the physical objects we produce and the
skills we use to produce them. Despite considerable focus on the evolution of
technology by social scientists and philosophers, there have been few attempts
to systematically quantify technological diversity and therefore the dynamics
of technological change remain poorly understood. Here we show a novel Bayesian
model for examining technological diversification adopted from paleontological
analysis of occurrence data. We use this framework to estimate the tempo of
diversification in American car and truck models produced between 1896 and 2014
and to test the relative importance of competition and extrinsic factors in
shaping changes in macroevolutionary rates. Our results identify a four-fold
decrease in the origination and extinction rates of car models and a negative
net diversification rate over the last thirty years. We also demonstrate that
competition played a more significant role in car model diversification than
either changes in oil prices or gross domestic product. Together our analyses
provide a set of tools that can enhance current research on technological and
cultural evolution by providing a flexible and quantitative framework for
exploring the dynamics of diversification.

manner is an open problem. Many believe that cross-frequency coupling between
the amplitude of high frequency local field potential oscillations in one
region and the phase of lower frequency signals in another may form a possible
mechanism. This work provides a preliminary study from both an experimental and
theoretical viewpoint, concentrating on possible coupling between the
hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex in rats during tasks involving working
memory, spatial navigation and decision making processes. Attempts to search
for such coupling events are made using newly developed MATLAB scripts. This
leads to the discovery of increased envelope-to-signal correlation (ESC)
between the 1-10 Hz hippocampus theta and 30-40 Hz pre-fontal cortex gamma
bands when a choice turn is approached during a T-maze task. From a theoretical
perspective, a standard connectionist modelling approach is extended to allow
for the formation of oscillations. Although detrimental to overall average task
performance, this did lead to a reduced increase in performance variation as
noise was increased, when compared to a standard non-oscillating model.

recognition. Although it is well established that visual experience shapes VTC
object representations, the impact of semantic and contextual learning is
unclear. In this study, we tracked changes in representations of novel visual
objects that emerged after learning meaningful information about each object.
Over multiple training sessions, participants learned to associate semantic
features (e.g. made of wood, floats) and spatial contextual associations (e.g.
found in gardens) with novel objects. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was
used to examine VTC activity for objects before and after learning.
Multivariate pattern similarity analyses revealed that, after learning, VTC
activity patterns carried information about the learned contextual associations
of the objects, such that objects with contextual associations exhibited higher
pattern similarity after learning. Further, these learning-induced increases in
pattern information about contextual associations were correlated with
reductions in pattern information about the objects visual features. In a
second experiment, we validated that these contextual effects translated to
real-life objects. Our findings demonstrate that visual object representations
in VTC are shaped by the knowledge we have about objects, and show that object
representations can flexibly adapt as a consequence of learning with the
changes related to the specific kind of newly acquired information.

  velocity distributions under force"	"  Fluctuations in the physical properties of biological machines are
inextricably linked to their functions. Distributions of run-lengths and
velocities of processive molecular motors, like kinesin-1, are accessible
through single molecule techniques, yet there is lack a rigorous theoretical
model for these probabilities up to now. We derive exact analytic results for a
kinetic model to predict the resistive force ($F$) dependent velocity ($P(v)$)
and run-length ($P(n)$) distribution functions of generic finitely processive
molecular motors that take forward and backward steps on a track. Our theory
quantitatively explains the zero force kinesin-1 data for both $P(n)$ and
$P(v)$ using the detachment rate as the only parameter, thus allowing us to
obtain the variations of these quantities under load. At non-zero $F$, $P(v)$
is non-Gaussian, and is bimodal with peaks at positive and negative values of
$v$. The prediction that $P(v)$ is bimodal is a consequence of the discrete
step-size of kinesin-1, and remains even when the step-size distribution is
taken into account. Although the predictions are based on analyses of kinesin-1
data, our results are general and should hold for any processive motor, which
walks on a track by taking discrete steps.

acquire thousands of electron microscopy (EM) images with nanometer-scale

potential to reveal the shapes of neurons and the synaptic connections between
them. However, imaging the brain of even a tiny organism like the fruit fly

image volumes and trace their neuronal connections. One solution is to apply
image segmentation algorithms to help automate the tracing tasks. In this
paper, we propose a novel strategy to apply such segmentation on very large
datasets that exceed the capacity of a single machine. Our solution is robust
to potential segmentation errors which could otherwise severely compromise the
quality of the overall segmentation, for example those due to poor classifier
generalizability or anomalies in the image dataset. We implement our algorithms
in a Spark application which minimizes disk I/O, and apply them to a few large
EM datasets, revealing both their effectiveness and scalability. We hope this
work will encourage external contributions to EM segmentation by providing 1) a
flexible plugin architecture that deploys easily on different cluster
environments and 2) an in-memory representation of segmentation that could be
conducive to new advances.

both with their hydrophobicity and their effects on certain ion channels. We
recently observed that several n-alcohol anesthetics inhibit heterogeneity in
plasma membrane derived vesicles by lowering the critical temperature ($T_c$)
for phase separation. Here we exploit conditions that stabilize membrane
heterogeneity to further test the correlation between the anesthetic potency of
n-alcohols and effects on $T_c$. First we show that hexadecanol acts oppositely
to n-alcohol anesthetics on membrane mixing and antagonizes ethanol induced
anesthesia in a tadpole behavioral assay. Second, we show that two previously
described `intoxication reversers' raise $T_c$ and counter ethanol's effects in
vesicles, mimicking the findings of previous electrophysiological and
behavioral measurements. Third, we find that hydrostatic pressure, long known
to reverse anesthesia, also raises $T_c$ in vesicles with a magnitude that
counters the effect of butanol at relevant concentrations and pressures. Taken
together, these results demonstrate that $\Delta T_c$ predicts anesthetic
potency for n-alcohols better than hydrophobicity in a range of contexts,
supporting a mechanistic role for membrane heterogeneity in general anesthesia.

  and RNA"	"  Although both RNA and proteins have densely packed native structures, chain
organizations of these two biopolymers are fundamentally different. Motivated
by the recent discoveries in chromatin folding that interphase chromosomes have
territorial organization with signatures pointing to metastability, we analyzed
the biomolecular structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank and found that
the intrachain contact probabilities, $P(s)$ as a function of the arc length
$s$, decay in power-law $\sim s^{-\gamma}$ over the intermediate range of $s$,
$10\lesssim s\lesssim 110$. We found that the contact probability scaling
exponent is $\gamma\approx 1.11$ for large RNA ($N>110$), $\gamma\approx 1.41$
for small sized RNA ($N<110$), and $\gamma\approx 1.65$ for proteins. Given
that Gaussian statistics is expected for a fully equilibrated chain in polymer
melts, the deviation of $\gamma$ value from $\gamma=1.5$ for the subchains of
large RNA in the native state suggests that the chain configuration of RNA is
not fully equilibrated. It is visually clear that folded structures of large
sized RNA ($N\gtrsim 110$) adopt crumpled structures, partitioned into modular
multi-domains assembled by proximal sequences along the chain, whereas the
polypeptide chain of folded proteins looks better mixed with the rest of the
structure. Our finding of $\gamma\approx 1$ for large RNA might be an
ineluctable consequence of the hierarchical ordering of the secondary to
tertiary elements in the folding process.

Measuring and estimating the diversity of these receptors is of great
importance for understanding adaptive immunity. In this chapter we review
recent modeling approaches for analyzing receptor diversity from
high-throughput sequencing data. We first clarify the various existing notions
of diversity, with its many competing mathematical indices, and the different
biological levels at which it can be evaluated. We then describe inference
methods for characterizing the statistical diversity of receptors at different
stages of their history: generation, selection and somatic evolution. We
discuss the intrinsic difficulty of estimating the diversity of receptors
realized in a given individual from incomplete samples. Finally, we emphasize
the limitations of diversity defined at the level of receptor sequences, and
advocate the more relevant notion of functional diversity relative to the set
of recognized antigens.

in such areas as ecology, paleontology and conservation biology. Here we
propose and investigate two types of sub-exponential models of population

of information loss is the underlying law for the evolution of a broad class of
models of population extinction. Finally, we propose a possible application of
this modeling framework to mechanisms underlying time perception.

  with binding kinetics and switching between antiparallel lanes"	"  Motor protein motion on biopolymers can be described by models related to the
totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). Inspired by experiments on
the motion of kinesin-4 motors on antiparallel microtubule overlaps, we analyze
a model incorporating the TASEP on two antiparallel lanes with binding kinetics
and lane switching. We determine the steady-state motor density profiles using
phase plane analysis of the steady-state mean field equations and kinetic Monte
Carlo simulations. We focus on the the density-density phase plane, where we
find an analytic solution to the mean-field model. By studying the phase space
flows, we determine the model's fixed points and their changes with parameters.
Phases previously identified for the single-lane model occur for low switching
rate between lanes. We predict a new multiple coexistence phase due to
additional fixed points that appear as the switching rate increases: switching
moves motors from the higher-density to the lower-density lane, causing local
jamming and creating multiple domain walls. We determine the phase diagram of
the model for both symmetric and general boundary conditions.

1604.00828	q-bio	q-bio.MN q-bio.BM	"A general reaction network unifies the aggregation behaviour of the
  A$\beta$42 peptide and its variants"	"  The amyloid $\beta$ peptide (A$\beta$42), whose aggregation is associated
with Alzheimer's disease, is an amphiphatic peptide with a high propensity to
self-assemble. A$\beta$42 has a net negative charge at physiological pH and
modulations of intermolecular electrostatic interactions can significantly
alter its aggregation behaviour. Variations in sequence and solution conditions
lead to varied macroscopic behaviour, often resulting in a number of different
mechanistic explanations for the aggregation of these closely related systems.
Here we alter the electrostatic interactions governing the fibril aggregation
kinetics by varying the ionic strength over an order of magnitude, which allows
us to sample the space of different reaction mechanisms, and develop a minimal
reaction network that explains the experimental kinetics under all the
different conditions. We find that an increase in the ionic strength leads to
an increased rate of surface catalysed nucleation over fragmentation and
eventually to a saturation of this nucleation process. More generally, this
reaction network connects previously separate systems, such as mutants of
A$\beta$42 and the wild type, on a continuous mechanistic landscape, thereby
providing a unified picture of the aggregation mechanism of A$\beta$42 and the
means of directly comparing the effects of intrinsic modifications of the
peptide to those of simple electrostatic shielding.

1604.00832	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Density independent population growth with random survival	"  A simplified model for the growth of a population is studied in which random
effects arise because reproducing individuals have a certain probability of
surviving until the next breeding season and hence contributing to the next
generation. The resulting Markov chain is that of a branching process with a
known generating function. For parameter values leading to non-extinction, an
approximating diffusion process is obtained for the population size.
  Results are obtained for the number of offspring $r_h$ and the initial
population size $N_0$ required to guarantee a given probabilty of survival. For
large probabilities of survival, increasing the initial population size from
$N_0=1$ to $N_0=2$ gives a very large decrease in required fecundity but
further increases in $N_0$ lead to much smaller decreases in $r_h$. For small
probabilities (< 0.2) of survival the decreases in required fecundity when
$N_0$ changes from 1 to 2 are very small. The calculations have relevance to
the survival of populations derived from colonizing individuals which could be
any of a variety of organisms.

1604.00919	q-bio	q-bio.NC q-bio.MN	"Biomimetic race model of the loop between the superior colliculus and
  the basal ganglia: Subcortical selection of saccade targets"	"  The Superior Colliculus, a laminar structure involved in the retinotopic
mapping of the visual field, plays a cardinal role in the several cortical and
subcortical loops of the saccadic system. Although the selection of saccade
targets has long been thought to be the sole product of cortical processes, a
growing body of evidence hints at the implication of the Superior Colliculus,
firstly by the lateral connections between the neurons of its maps, and
secondly by its interactions with the midbrain Basal Ganglia, already renowned
for their role in decision making. We propose a biomimetic population-coded
race model of selection based on a dynamic tecto-basal loop that reproduces the
observed ability of the Superior Colliculus to stochastically select between
similar stimuli, the accuracy of this selection depending on the
discriminability of the target and the distractors. Our model also offers an
explanation for the phenomenon of Remote Distractor Effect based on the lateral
connectivity within the Basal Ganglia circuitry rather than on lateral
inhibitions within the collicular maps. Finally, we propose a role for the
intermediate layers of the Superior Colliculus, as stochastic integrators
dynamically gated by the selective disinhibition of the Basal Ganglia channels
that is consistent with the recorded activity profiles of these neurons.

collect massive quantities of data about complex systems. While key advances
are being made in detailed mapping of systems, how to relate this data to
solving many of the challenges facing humanity is unclear. The questions we
often wish to address require identifying the impact of interventions on the
system and that impact is not apparent in the detailed data that is available.
Here we review key concepts and motivate a general framework for building
larger scale views of complex systems and for characterizing the importance of
information in physical, biological and social systems. We provide examples of
its application to evolutionary biology with relevance to ecology,
biodiversity, pandemics, and human lifespan, and in the context of social
systems with relevance to ethnic violence, global food prices, and stock market
panic. Framing scientific inquiry as an effort to determine what is important
and unimportant is a means for advancing our understanding and addressing many
practical concerns, such as economic development or treating disease.

1604.01210	q-bio	stat.AP q-bio.MN	NEAT: an efficient network enrichment analysis test	"  Network enrichment analysis is a powerful method, which allows to integrate
gene enrichment analysis with the information on relationships between genes
that is provided by gene networks. Existing tests for network enrichment
analysis deal only with undirected networks, they can be computationally slow
and are based on normality assumptions.
  We propose NEAT, a test for network enrichment analysis. The test is based on
the hypergeometric distribution, which naturally arises as the null
distribution in this context. NEAT can be applied not only to undirected, but
to directed and partially directed networks as well. Our simulations indicate
that NEAT is considerably faster than alternative resampling-based methods, and
that its capacity to detect enrichments is at least as good as the one of
alternative tests. We discuss applications of NEAT to network analyses in yeast
by testing for enrichment of the Environmental Stress Response target gene set
with GO Slim and KEGG functional gene sets, and also by testing for
associations between GO Slim categories themselves.
  NEAT is a flexible and efficient test for network enrichment analysis that
aims to overcome some limitations of existing resampling-based tests. The
method is implemented in the R package neat, which can be freely downloaded
from CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/package=neat).

  Algorithms"	"  The pathogenesis of cancer in human is still poorly understood. With the
rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, huge volumes of
cancer genomics data have been generated. Deciphering those data poses great
opportunities and challenges to computational biologists. One of such key
challenges is to distinguish driver mutations, genes as well as pathways from
passenger ones. Mutual exclusivity of gene mutations (each patient has no more
than one mutation in the gene set) has been observed in various cancer types
and thus has been used as an important property of a driver gene set or
pathway. In this article, we aim to review the recent development of
computational models and algorithms for discovering driver pathways or modules
in cancer with the focus on mutual exclusivity-based ones.

incorporated into protocols that complement and supplement existing movements
of the user. Two possible scenarios for such a control could be: the increasing
interest to control artificial supernumerary prosthetics, or in cases following
brain injury where BCI can be incorporated alongside residual movements to
recover ability. In this study we explore the extent to which the human motor
cortex is able to concurrently control movements via a BCI and overtly executed
movements. Crucially both movement types are driven from the same cortical
site. With this we aim to dissociate the activity at this cortical site from
the movements being made and instead allow the representation and control for
the BCI to develop alongside motor cortex activity. We investigated both BCI
performance and its effect on the movement evoked potentials originally
associated with overt execution.

several symbol sequences is proposed. The method is based on a specific gauge
applied to symbol sequences that guarantees identification of the repeating
substrings. It allows the matching of substrings to contain a given level of
errors. The gauge is based on the development of a heavily sparse dictionary of
repeats, thus drastically accelerating the search procedure. Some genomic
applications illustrate the method.

1604.01359	q-bio	q-bio.NC q-bio.BM	Physical limits to magnetogenetics	"  This is an analysis of how magnetic fields affect biological molecules and
cells. It was prompted by a series of prominent reports regarding magnetism in
biological systems. The first claims to have identified a protein complex that
acts like a compass needle to guide magnetic orientation in animals (Qin et
al., 2016). Two other articles report magnetic control of membrane conductance
by attaching ferritin to an ion channel protein and then tugging the ferritin
or heating it with a magnetic field (Stanley et al., 2015; Wheeler et al.,
2016). Here I argue that these claims conflict with basic laws of physics. The
discrepancies are large: from 5 to 10 log units. If the reported phenomena do
in fact occur, they must have causes entirely different from the ones proposed
by the authors. The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes is found to
seriously limit their utility for engineering magnetically sensitive cells.

1604.01674	q-bio	q-bio.QM q-bio.PE	OFFl models: novel schema for dynamical modeling of biological systems	"  Flow diagrams are a common tool used to help build and interpret models of
dynamical systems, often in biological contexts such as consumer-resource
models and similar compartmental models. Typically, their usage is intuitive
and informal. Here, we present a formalized version of flow diagrams as a kind
of weighted directed graph which follow a strict grammar, which translate into
a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by a single unambiguous
rule, and which have an equivalent representation as a relational database. (We
abbreviate this schema of ""ODEs and formalized flow diagrams"" as OFFl.) Drawing
a diagram within this strict grammar encourages a mental discipline on the part
of the modeler in which all dynamical processes of a system are thought of as
interactions between dynamical species that draw parcels from one or more
source species and deposit them into target species according to a set of
transformation rules. From these rules, the net rate of change for each species
can be derived. The modeling schema can therefore be understood as both an
epistemic and practical heuristic for modeling, serving both as an
organizational framework for the model building process and as a mechanism for
deriving ODEs. All steps of the schema beyond the initial scientific
(intuitive, creative) abstraction of natural observations into model variables
are algorithmic and easily carried out by a computer, thus enabling the future
development of a dedicated software implementation. Such tools would empower
the modeler to consider significantly more complex models than practical
limitations might have otherwise proscribed, since the modeling framework
itself manages that complexity on the modeler's behalf. In this report, we
describe the chief motivations for OFFl, outline its implementation, and
utilize a range of classic examples from ecology and epidemiology to showcase
its features.

1604.01680	q-bio	q-bio.NC	The Complex Hierarchical Topology of EEG Functional Connectivity	"  Understanding the complex hierarchical topology of functional brain networks
is a key aspect of functional connectivity research. Such topics are obscured
by the widespread use of sparse binary network models which are fundamentally
different to the complete weighted networks derived from functional
connectivity. We introduce two techniques to probe the hierarchical complexity
of topologies. Firstly, a new metric to measure hierarchical complexity;
secondly, a Weighted Complex Hierarchy (WCH) model. To thoroughly evaluate our
techniques, we generalise sparse binary network archetypes to weighted forms
and explore the main topological features of brain networks- integration,
regularity and modularity- using curves over density. By controlling the
parameters of our model, the highest complexity is found to arise between a
random topology and a strict 'class-based' topology. Further, the model has
equivalent complexity to EEG phase-lag networks at peak performance.
Hierarchical complexity attains greater magnitude and range of differences
between different networks than the previous commonly used complexity metric
and our WCH model offers a much broader range of network topology than the
standard scale-free and small-world models at a full range of densities. Our
metric and model provide a rigorous characterisation of hierarchical
complexity. Importantly, our framework shows a scale of complexity arising
between 'all nodes are equal' topologies at one extreme and 'strict
class-based' topologies at the other.

1604.01740	q-bio	q-bio.MN	Multiple network alignment via multiMAGNA++	"  Network alignment (NA) aims to find a node mapping between molecular networks
of different species that identifies topologically or functionally similar
network regions. Analogous to genomic sequence alignment, NA can be used to
transfer biological knowledge from well- to poorly-studied species between
aligned network regions. Pairwise NA (PNA) finds similar regions between two
networks while multiple NA (MNA) can align more than two networks. We focus on
MNA. Existing MNA methods aim to maximize total similarity over all aligned
nodes (node conservation). Then, they evaluate alignment quality by measuring
the amount of conserved edges, but only after the alignment is constructed.
Directly optimizing edge conservation during alignment construction in addition
to node conservation may result in superior alignments. Thus, we present a
novel MNA approach called multiMAGNA++ that can achieve this. Indeed,
multiMAGNA++ generally outperforms or is on par with the existing MNA methods,
while often completing faster than the existing methods. That is, multiMAGNA++
scales well to larger network data and can be parallelized effectively. During
method evaluation, we also introduce new MNA quality measures to allow for more
complete alignment characterization as well as more fair MNA method comparison
compared to using only the existing alignment quality measures.

1604.01816	q-bio	astro-ph.EP astro-ph.HE physics.ao-ph q-bio.PE	"Solar irradiance changes and phytoplankton productivity in Earth's ocean
  following astrophysical ionizing radiation events"	"  Two atmospheric responses to simulated astrophysical ionizing radiation
events significant to life on Earth are production of odd-nitrogen species,
especially NO2, and subsequent depletion of stratospheric ozone. Ozone
depletion increases incident short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation (UVB,
280-315 nm) and longer ( > 600 nm) wavelengths of photosynthetically available
radiation (PAR, 400 -700 nm). On the other hand, the NO2 haze decreases
atmospheric transmission in the long-wavelength UVA (315-400 nm) and short
wavelength PAR. Here we use the results of previous simulations of incident
spectral irradiance following an ionizing radiation event to predict changes in
Terran productivity focusing on photosynthesis of marine phytoplankton. The
prediction is based on a spectral model of photosynthetic response developed
for the dominant genera in central regions of the ocean (Synechococcus and
Prochlorococcus), and remote-sensing based observations of spectral water
transparency, temperature, wind speed and mixed layer depth. Predicted
productivity declined after a simulated ionizing event, but the effect
integrated over the water column was small. For integrations taking into
account the full depth range of PAR transmission (down to 0.1% of utilizable
PAR), the decrease was at most 2-3% (depending on strain), with larger effects
(5-7%) for integrations just to the depth of the surface mixed layer. The
deeper integrations were most affected by the decreased utilizable PAR at depth
due to the NO2 haze, whereas shallower integrations were most affected by the
increased surface UV.

1604.01826	q-bio	q-bio.BM	Multi-shell model of ion-induced nucleic acid condensation	"  We present a semi-quantitative model of condensation of short nucleic acid
(NA) duplexes induced by tri-valent cobalt(III) hexammine (CoHex) ions. The
model is based on partitioning of bound counterion distribution around singleNA
duplex into ""external"" and ""internal"" ion binding shells distinguished by the
proximity to duplex helical axis. In the aggregated phase the shells overlap,
which leads to significantly increased attraction of CoHex ions in these
overlaps with the neighboring duplexes. The duplex aggregation free energy is
decomposed into attractive and repulsive components in such a way that they can
be represented by simple analytical expressions with parameters derived from
molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and numerical solutions of Poisson equation.
The short-range interactions described by the attractive term depend on the
fractions of bound ions in the overlapping shells and affinity of CoHex to the
""external"" shell of nearly neutralized duplex. The repulsive components of the
free energy are duplex configurational entropy loss upon the aggregation and
the electrostatic repulsion of the duplexes that remains after neutralization
by bound CoHex ions. The estimates of the aggregation free energy are
consistent with the experimental range of NA duplex condensation propensities,
including the unusually poor condensation of RNA structures and subtle sequence
effects upon DNA condensation. The model predicts that, in contrast to DNA, RNA
duplexes may condense into tighter packed aggregates with a higher degree of
duplex neutralization. The model also predicts that longer NA fragments will
condense more readily than shorter ones. The ability of this model to explain
experimentally observed trends in NA condensation, lends support to proposed NA
condensation picture based on the multivalent ""ion binding shells"".

1604.01943	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Brief wide-field photostimuli evoke and modulate oscillatory
  reverberating activity in cortical networks"	"  Cell assemblies manipulation by optogenetics is pivotal to advance
neuroscience and neuroengineering. In in vivo applications, photostimulation
often broadly addresses a population of cells simultaneously, leading to
feed-forward and to reverberating responses in recurrent microcircuits. The
former arise from direct activation of targets downstream, and are
straightforward to interpret. The latter are consequence of feedback
connectivity and may reflect a variety of time-scales and complex dynamical
properties. We investigated wide-field photostimulation in cortical networks in
vitro, employing substrate-integrated microelectrode arrays and long-term
cultured neuronal networks. We characterized the effect of brief light pulses,
while restricting the expression of channelrhodopsin to principal neurons. We
evoked robust reverberating responses, oscillating in the physiological gamma
frequency range, and found that such a frequency could be reliably manipulated
varying the light pulse duration, not its intensity. By pharmacology,
mathematical modelling, and intracellular recordings, we conclude that gamma
oscillations likely emerge as in vivo from the excitatory-inhibitory interplay
and that, unexpectedly, the light stimuli transiently facilitate excitatory
synaptic transmission. Of relevance for in vitro models of (dys)functional
cortical microcircuitry and in vivo manipulations of cell assemblies, we give
for the first time evidence of network-level consequences of the alteration of
synaptic physiology by optogenetics

1604.02099	q-bio	q-bio.QM cs.CE	WeSME: Uncovering Mutual Exclusivity of Cancer Drivers and Beyond	"  Mutual exclusivity is a widely recognized property of many cancer drivers.
Knowledge about these relationships can provide important insights into cancer
drivers, cancer-driving pathways, and cancer subtypes. It can also be used to
predict new functional interactions between cancer driving genes and uncover
novel cancer drivers. Currently, most of mutual exclusivity analyses are
preformed focusing on a limited set of genes in part due to the computational
cost required to rigorously compute p-values. To reduce the computing cost and
perform less restricted mutual exclusivity analysis, we developed an efficient
method to estimate p-values while controlling the mutation rates of individual
patients and genes similar to the permutation test. A comprehensive mutual
exclusivity analysis allowed us to uncover mutually exclusive pairs, some of
which may have relatively low mutation rates. These pairs often included likely
cancer drivers that have been missed in previous analyses. More importantly,
our results demonstrated that mutual exclusivity can also provide information
that goes beyond the interactions between cancer drivers and can, for example,
elucidate different mutagenic processes in different cancer groups. In
particular, including frequently mutated, long genes such as TTN in our
analysis allowed us to observe interesting patterns of APOBEC activity in
breast cancer and identify a set of related driver genes that are highly
predictive of patient survival. In addition, we utilized our mutual exclusivity
analysis in support of a previously proposed model where APOBEC activity is the
underlying process that causes TP53 mutations in a subset of breast cancer
cases.

human brain network with N=836733 connected nodes available from the Open
Connectome project. While in case of simple threshold models a sharp
discontinuous phase transition without any critical dynamics arises, variable
thresholds models exhibit extended power-law scaling regions. This is
attributed to fact that Griffiths effects, stemming from the
topological/interaction heterogeneity of the network, can become relevant if
the input sensitivity of nodes is equalized. I have studied the effects effects
of link directness, as well as the consequence of inhibitory connections.
Non-universal power-law avalanche size and time distributions have been found
with exponents agreeing with the values obtained in electrode experiments of
the human brain. The dynamical critical region occurs in an extended control
parameter space without the assumption of self organized criticality.

Repertoire construction is a preliminary step of analysis of clonal lineages,
understanding of immune response dynamics, population analysis of
immunoglobulin and TCR loci. Emergence of MiSeq Illumina sequencing machine in
2013 opened horizons of investigation of adaptive immune repertoires using
highly accurate reads. Reads produced by MiSeq are able to cover repertoires of
moderate size. At the same time, throughput of sequencing machines increases
from year to year. This will enable ultra deep scanning of adaptive immune
repertoires and analysis of their diversity. Such data requires both efficient
and highly accurate repertoire construction tools. In 2015 Safonova et al.
presented IgRepertoireConstructor, a tool for accurate construction of antibody
repertoire and immunoproteogenomics analysis. Unfortunately, proposed algorithm
was very time and memory consuming and could be a bottleneck of processing
large immunosequencing libraries. In this paper we overcome this challenge and
present IgReC, a novel algorithm for adaptive repertoire construction problem.
IgReC reconstructs a repertoire with high precision even if each input read
contains sequencing errors and performs well on contemporary datasets. Results
of computational experiments show that IgReC improves state-of-the-art in the

1604.02208	q-bio	q-bio.MN	"Dynamic network and epigenetic landscape model of a regulatory core
  underlying spontaneous immortalization and epithelial carcinogenesis"	"  Tumorigenic transformation of human epithelial cells in vitro has been
described experimentally as the potential result of a process known as
spontaneous immortalization. In this process a generic series of cell state
transitions occur in which normal epithelial cells acquire a senescent state,
later surpassed to attain first a mesenchymal state and then a final
mesenchymal stem-like phenotype, with potential tumorigenic behavior. In this
paper we integrate published data on the molecular components and interactions
that have been described as key regulators of such cell states and transitions.
A large network, that is provided, is constructed and then reduced with the aim
of recovering a minimal regulatory core incorporating the necessary and
sufficient restrictions to recover the observed cell states and their generic
progression patterns in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Data is formalized
into logical regulatory rules that govern the dynamics of each of the network's
components as a function of the states of its regulators. The proposed core
gene regulatory network attains only three steady-state gene expression
configurations that correspond to the profiles characteristic of normal
epithelial, senescent, and mesenchymal stem-like cells. Interestingly,
epigenetic landscape analyses of the uncovered network shows that it also
recovers the generic time-ordered transitions documented during tumorigenic
transformation in vitro of epithelial cells. The latter strongly correlate with
the patterns observed during the progressive pathological description of
epithelial carcinogenesis in vivo.

can produce sequencing reads up to 50,000 bp long but with an error rate of at
least 15%. Reducing the error rate is necessary for subsequent utilisation of
the reads in, e.g., de novo genome assembly. The error correction problem has
been tackled either by aligning the long reads against each other or by a
hybrid approach that uses the more accurate short reads produced by second
generation sequencing technologies to correct the long reads. We present an
error correction method that uses long reads only. The method consists of two
phases: first we use an iterative alignment-free correction method based on de
Bruijn graphs with increasing length of k-mers, and second, the corrected reads
are further polished using long-distance dependencies that are found using
multiple alignments. According to our experiments the proposed method is the
most accurate one relying on long reads only for read sets with high coverage.
Furthermore, when the coverage of the read set is at least 75x, the throughput
of the new method is at least 20% higher. LoRMA is freely available at

1604.02403	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Cluster-Span Threshold: An unbiased threshold for binarising weighted
  complete networks in functional connectivity analysis"	"  We propose a new unbiased threshold for network analysis named the
Cluster-Span Threshold (CST). This is based on the clustering coefficient, C,
following logic that a balance of `clustering' to `spanning' triples results in
a useful topology for network analysis and that the product of complementing
properties has a unique value only when perfectly balanced. We threshold
networks by fixing C at this balanced value, rather than fixing connection
density at an arbitrary value, as has been the trend. We compare results from
an electroencephalogram data set of volunteers performing visual short term
memory tasks of the CST alongside other thresholds, including maximum spanning
trees. We find that the CST holds as a sensitive threshold for distinguishing
differences in the functional connectivity between tasks. This provides a
sensitive and objective method for setting a threshold on weighted complete
networks which may prove influential on the future of functional connectivity
research.

memory representation recorded from young healthy volunteers performing several
different Visual Short-Term Memory (VSTM) tasks which have proven useful in the
assessment of clinical and preclinical Alzheimer's disease. We compare network
analysis using Maximum Spanning Trees (MSTs) with network analysis obtained
using 20% and 25% connection thresholds on the VSTM data. MSTs are a promising
method of network analysis negating the more classical use of thresholds which
are so far chosen arbitrarily. However, we find that the threshold analyses
outperforms MSTs for detection of functional network differences. Particularly,
MSTs fail to find any significant differences. Further, the thresholds detect
significant differences between shape and shape-colour binding tasks when these
are tested in the left side of the display screen, but no such differences are
detected when these tasks are tested for in the right side of the display
screen. This provides evidence that contralateral activity is a significant
factor in sensitivity for detection of cognitive task differences.

taxonomical or functional assignation rely on a small subset of the sequences
that can be associated to known organisms. On the other hand, de novo methods,
that compare the whole sets of sequences, either do not scale up on ambitious
metagenomic projects or do not provide precise and exhaustive results.
  Methods. These limitations motivated the development of a new de novo
metagenomic comparative method, called Simka. This method computes a large
collection of standard ecological distances by replacing species counts by
k-mer counts. Simka scales-up today's metagenomic projects thanks to a new
parallel k-mer counting strategy on multiple datasets.
  Results. Experiments on public Human Microbiome Project datasets demonstrate
that Simka captures the essential underlying biological structure. Simka was
able to compute in a few hours both qualitative and quantitative ecological
distances on hundreds of metagenomic samples (690 samples, 32 billions of
reads). We also demonstrate that analyzing metagenomes at the k-mer level is
highly correlated with extremely precise de novo comparison techniques which
rely on all-versus-all sequences alignment strategy or which are based on
taxonomic profiling.

1604.02454	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"High temporal variability in the occurrence of consumer-resource
  interactions in ecological networks"	"  Ecological networks are theoretical abstractions that represent ecological
communities. These networks are usually defined as static entities, in which
the occurrence of a particular interaction between species is considered fixed
despite the intrinsic dynamics of ecological systems. However, empirical
analysis of the temporal variation of trophic interactions is constrained by
the lack of data with high spatial, temporal, and taxonomic resolution. Here,
we evaluate the spatiotemporal variability of multiple consumer-resource
interactions of large marine networks. The tropic interactions of all of the
analyzed networks had low temporal persistence, which was well described by a
common exponential decay in the rank-frequency relationship of
consumer-resource interactions. This common pattern of low temporal persistence
was evident despite the dissimilarities of environmental conditions among
sites. Between-site rank correlations of frequency of occurrence of
interactions ranged from 0.59 to 0.73. After removing the interactions with
<50% frequency, the between-site correlations decreased to values between 0.60
and 0.28, indicating that low-frequency interactions accounted for the apparent
similarities between sites. Our results showed that the communities studied
were characterized by few persistent interactions and a large number of
transient trophic interactions. We suggest that consumer-resource temporal
asynchrony in addition to varying local environmental conditions and
opportunistic foraging could be among the mechanisms generating the observed
rank-frequency relationship of trophic interactions. Therefore, our results
question the analysis of ecological communities as static and persistent
natural entities and stress the need for strengthening the analysis of temporal
variability in ecological networks and long-term studies.

1604.02467	q-bio	q-bio.QM	Finding Mutated Subnetworks Associated with Survival in Cancer	"  Next-generation sequencing technologies allow the measurement of somatic
mutations in a large number of patients from the same cancer type. One of the
main goals in analyzing these mutations is the identification of mutations
associated with clinical parameters, such as survival time. This goal is
hindered by the genetic heterogeneity of mutations in cancer, due to the fact
that genes and mutations act in the context of pathways. To identify mutations
associated with survival time it is therefore crucial to study mutations in the
context of interaction networks.
  In this work we study the problem of identifying subnetworks of a large
gene-gene interaction network that have mutations associated with survival. We
formally define the associated computational problem by using a score for
subnetworks based on the test statistic of the log-rank test, a widely used
statistical test for comparing the survival of two populations. We show that
the computational problem is NP-hard and we propose a novel algorithm, called
Network of Mutations Associated with Survival (NoMAS), to solve it. NoMAS is
based on the color-coding technique, that has been previously used in other
applications to find the highest scoring subnetwork with high probability when
the subnetwork score is additive. In our case the score is not additive;
nonetheless, we prove that under a reasonable model for mutations in cancer
NoMAS does identify the optimal solution with high probability. We test NoMAS
on simulated and cancer data, comparing it to approaches based on single gene
tests and to various greedy approaches. We show that our method does indeed
find the optimal solution and performs better than the other approaches.
Moreover, on two cancer datasets our method identifies subnetworks with
significant association to survival when none of the genes has significant
association with survival when considered in isolation.

  CoverAge, CO-alignment, and paired-end read LinkAge"	"  The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies enables
researchers to sequence complex microbial communities directly from
environment. Since assembly typically produces only genome fragments, also
known as contigs, instead of entire genome, it is crucial to group them into
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for further taxonomic profiling and
down-streaming functional analysis. OTU clustering is also referred to as
binning. We present COCACOLA, a general framework automatically bin contigs
into OTUs based upon sequence composition and coverage across multiple samples.
  The effectiveness of COCACOLA is demonstrated in both simulated and real
datasets in comparison to state-of-art binning approaches such as CONCOCT,
GroopM, MaxBin and MetaBAT. The superior performance of COCACOLA relies on two
aspects. One is employing $L_{1}$ distance instead of Euclidean distance for
better taxonomic identification during initialization. More importantly,
COCACOLA takes advantage of both hard clustering and soft clustering by
sparsity regularization.
  In addition, the COCACOLA framework seamlessly embraces customized knowledge
to facilitate binning accuracy. In our study, we have investigated two types of
additional knowledge, the co-alignment to reference genomes and linkage of
contigs provided by paired-end reads, as well as the ensemble of both. We find
that both co-alignment and linkage information further improve binning in the
majority of cases. COCACOLA is scalable and faster than CONCOCT ,GroopM, MaxBin
and MetaBAT.

  Cancer Sequencing"	"  The reconstruction of phylogenetic trees from mixed populations has become
important in the study of cancer evolution, as sequencing is often performed on
bulk tumor tissue containing mixed populations of cells. Recent work has shown
how to reconstruct a perfect phylogeny tree from samples that contain mixtures
of two-state characters, where each character/locus is either mutated or not.
However, most cancers contain more complex mutations, such as copy-number
aberrations, that exhibit more than two states. We formulate the Multi-State
Perfect Phylogeny Mixture Deconvolution Problem of reconstructing a multi-state
perfect phylogeny tree given mixtures of the leaves of the tree. We
characterize the solutions of this problem as a restricted class of spanning
trees in a graph constructed from the input data, and prove that the problem is
NP-complete. We derive an algorithm to enumerate such trees in the important
special case of cladisitic characters, where the ordering of the states of each
character is given. We apply our algorithm to simulated data and to two cancer
datasets. On simulated data, we find that for a small number of samples, the
Multi-State Perfect Phylogeny Mixture Deconvolution Problem often has many
solutions, but that this ambiguity declines quickly as the number of samples
increases. On real data, we recover copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity,
single-copy amplification and single-copy deletion events, as well as their
interactions with single-nucleotide variants.

  discriminant approach"	"  Many systems in biology, physics and engineering can be described by systems
of ordinary differential equation containing many parameters. When studying the
dynamic behavior of these large, nonlinear systems, it is useful to identify
and characterize the steady-state solutions as the model parameters vary, a
technically challenging problem in a high-dimensional parameter landscape.
Rather than simply determining the number and stability of steady-states at
distinct points in parameter space, we decompose the parameter space into
finitely many regions, the steady-state solutions being consistent within each
distinct region. From a computational algebraic viewpoint, the boundary of
these regions is contained in the discriminant locus. We develop global and
local numerical algorithms for constructing the discriminant locus and
classifying the parameter landscape. We showcase our numerical approaches by
applying them to molecular and cell-network models.

  model"	"  In epidemiological modelling, dynamics on networks, and in particular
adaptive and heterogeneous networks have recently received much interest. Here
we present a detailed analysis of a previously proposed model that combines
heterogeneity in the individuals with adaptive rewiring of the network
structure in response to a disease. We show that in this model qualitative
changes in the dynamics occur in two phase transitions. In a macroscopic
description one of these corresponds to a local bifurcation whereas the other
one corresponds to a non-local heteroclinic bifurcation. This model thus
provides a rare example of a system where a phase transition is caused by a
non-local bifurcation, while both micro- and macro-level dynamics are
accessible to mathematical analysis. The bifurcation points mark the onset of a
behaviour that we call network inoculation. In the respective parameter region
exposure of the system to a pathogen will lead to an outbreak that collapses,
but leaves the network in a configuration where the disease cannot reinvade,
despite every agent returning to the susceptible class. We argue that this
behaviour and the associated phase transitions can be expected to occur in a
wide class of models of sufficient complexity.

1604.02699	q-bio	q-bio.QM q-bio.GN	Low-density locality-sensitive hashing boosts metagenomic binning	"  Metagenomic binning is an essential task in analyzing metagenomic sequence
datasets. To analyze structure or function of microbial communities from
environmental samples, metagenomic sequence fragments are assigned to their
taxonomic origins. Although sequence alignment algorithms can readily be used
and usually provide high-resolution alignments and accurate binning results,
the computational cost of such alignment-based methods becomes prohibitive as
metagenomic datasets continue to grow. Alternative compositional-based methods,
which exploit sequence composition by profiling local short k-mers in
fragments, are often faster but less accurate than alignment-based methods.
Inspired by the success of linear error correcting codes in noisy channel
communication, we introduce Opal, a fast and accurate novel compositional-based
binning method. It incorporates ideas from Gallager's low-density parity-check
code to design a family of compact and discriminative locality-sensitive
hashing functions that encode long-range compositional dependencies in long
fragments. By incorporating the Gallager LSH functions as features in a simple
linear SVM, Opal provides fast, accurate and robust binning for datasets
consisting of a large number of species, even with mutations and sequencing
errors. Opal not only performs up to two orders of magnitude faster than BWA,
an alignment-based binning method, but also achieves improved binning accuracy
and robustness to sequencing errors. Opal also outperforms models built on
traditional k-mer profiles in terms of robustness and accuracy. Finally, we
demonstrate that we can effectively use Opal in the ""coarse search"" stage of a
compressive genomics pipeline to identify a much smaller candidate set of
taxonomic origins for a subsequent alignment-based method to analyze, thus
providing metagenomic binning with high scalability, high accuracy and high
resolution.

  characterization"	"  Adhesion plays an integral role in diverse biological functions ranging from
cellular transport to tissue development. Estimation of adhesion strength,
therefore, becomes important to gain biophysical insight into these phenomena.
In this Letter, we use curvature elasticity to present non-intuitive, yet
remarkably simple, universal relationships that capture vesicle-substrate
interactions. Our study reveals that the inverse of the height, exponential of
the contact area, and the force required to detach the vesicle from the
substrate vary linearly with the square root of the adhesion energy. These
relationships not only provide efficient strategies to tease out adhesion
energy of biological molecules but can also be used to characterize the
physical properties of elastic biomimetic nanoparticles. We validate the
modeling predictions with experimental data from two previous studies.

microbiota. In a few well-studied cases, bacterial communities have been
observed to coordinate their metabolic fluxes. In principle, bacteria can
divide tasks to reap the benefits of specialization, as in human economies.
However, the benefits and stability of an economy of bacterial specialists are
far from obvious. Here, we physically model the population dynamics of bacteria
that compete for steadily supplied resources. Importantly, we explicitly model
the metabolic fluxes yielding cellular biomass production under the constraint
of a limited enzyme budget. In our framework, we find that population dynamics
generally leads to the coexistence of different metabolic types, which satisfy
an extended competitive exclusion principle (even allowing for adaptive
mutation). We establish that these consortia act as cartels, whereby population
dynamics pins down resource concentrations at values for which no other
strategy can invade. Finally, we propose that at steady supply, cartels of
competing strategies automatically yield maximum biomass, thereby achieving a
collective optimum.

profiles have to be further adapted to individual patients. Therefore, we
present a new model to represent cycle phenomena in circadian rhythms. The

  Feed-Forward Loop, Revisited"	"  The intrinsic stochasticity of gene expression is usually mitigated in higher
eukaryotes by post-transcriptional regulation channels that stabilise the
output layer, most notably protein levels. The discovery of small non-coding
RNAs (miRNAs) in specific motifs of the genetic regulatory network has led to
identifying noise buffering as the possible key function they exert in
regulation. Recent in vitro} and in silico studies have corroborated this
hypothesis. It is however also known that miRNA-mediated noise reduction is
hampered by transcriptional bursting in simple topologies. Here, using
stochastic simulations validated by analytical calculations based on van
Kampen's expansion, we revisit the noise-buffering capacity of the
miRNA-mediated Incoherent Feed Forward Loop (IFFL), a small module that is
widespread in the gene regulatory networks of higher eukaryotes, in order to
account for the effects of intermittency in the transcriptional activity of the
modulator gene. We show that bursting considerably alters the circuit's ability
to control static protein noise. By comparing with other regulatory
architectures, we find that direct transcriptional regulation significantly
outperforms the IFFL in a broad range of kinetic parameters. This suggests
that, under pulsatile inputs, static noise reduction may be less important than
dynamical aspects of noise and information processing in characterising the
performance of regulatory elements.

earlier studies that used high-grade equipment in laboratory settings. Here we
reproduce many of the results from these studies using portable low-cost

to cellular identity. However, the principles governing 3D interphase genome
architecture and its faithful transmission through disruptive events of
cell-cycle, like mitosis, are not fully understood. By using Brownian dynamics
simulations of Drosophila chromosome 3R up to time-scales of minutes, we show
that chromatin binding profile of Polycomb-repressive-complex-1 robustly
predicts a sub-set of topologically associated domains (TADs), and inclusion of
other factors recapitulates the profile of all TADs, as observed
experimentally. Our simulations show that chromosome 3R attains interphase
organization from mitotic state by a two-step process in which formation of
local TADs is followed by long-range interactions. Our model also explains
statistical features and tracks the assembly kinetics of polycomb subnuclear
clusters. In conclusion, our approach can be used to predict structural and
kinetic features of 3D chromosome folding and its associated proteins in
biological relevant genomic and time scales.

distributed gradient descent method that helps explain how bacterial cells
collectively search for food in harsh environments using extremely limited
communication and computational complexity. This method can also be used for
computational tasks when agents are facing similarly restricted conditions. We
formalize the communication and computation assumptions required for successful
coordination and prove that the method we propose leads to convergence even
when using a dynamically changing interaction network. The proposed method
improves upon prior models suggested for bacterial foraging despite making
fewer assumptions. Simulation studies and analysis of experimental data

high affinity and specificity, are utilized in an increasing spectrum of
bio-medical applications. Aptamers are identified in vitro via the Systematic
Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) protocol. SELEX selects
binders through an iterative process that, starting from a pool of random
ssDNA/RNA sequences, amplifies target-affine species through a series of
selection cycles. HT-SELEX, which combines SELEX with high throughput
sequencing, has recently transformed aptamer development and has opened the
field to even more applications. HT-SELEX is capable of generating over half a
billion data points, challenging computational scientists with the task of
identifying aptamer properties such as sequence structure motifs that determine
binding. While currently available motif finding approaches suggest partial
solutions to this question, none possess the generality or scalability required
for HT-SELEX data, and they do not take advantage of important properties of
the experimental procedure.
  We present AptaTRACE, a novel approach for the identification of
sequence-structure binding motifs in HT-SELEX derived aptamers. Our approach
leverages the experimental design of the SELEX protocol and identifies
sequence-structure motifs that show a signature of selection. Because of its
unique approach, AptaTRACE can uncover motifs even when these are present in
only a minuscule fraction of the pool. Due to these features, our method can
help to reduce the number of selection cycles required to produce aptamers with
the desired properties, thus reducing cost and time of this rather expensive
procedure. The performance of the method on simulated and real data indicates
that AptaTRACE can detect sequence-structure motifs even in highly challenging
data.

read mapping. However, these data structures typically assume that the
underlying reference text is static and will not change over the course of the
queries being made. Some progress has been made in exploring how certain text
indices, like the suffix array, may be updated, rather than rebuilt from
scratch, when the underlying reference changes. Yet, these update operations
can be complex in practice, difficult to implement, and give fairly pessimistic
worst-case bounds. We present a novel data structure, SkipPatch, for
maintaining a k-mer-based index over a dynamically changing genome. SkipPatch
pairs a hash-based k-mer index with an indexable skip list that is used to
efficiently maintain the set of edits that have been applied to the original

injected on a \emph{single} neuron are investigated. Stimulating the
largest-degree neuron in the network, it is found that as the intensity of the
stimulus increases, the network will be transiting from the resting to firing
states and then restoring to the resting state, showing a bounded firing region
in the parameter space. Furthermore, it is found that as the coupling strength
decreases, the firing region is gradually expanded and, at the weak couplings,
separated into disconnected subregions. By a simplified network model, we
conduct a detail analysis on the bifurcation diagram of the network dynamics in
the two-dimensional parameter space spanned by stimulating intensity and
coupling strength, and, by introducing a new coefficient named effective
stimulus, explore the mechanisms of the modified firing region. It is revealed
that the coupling strength and stimulating intensity are equally important in
evoking the network, but with different mechanisms. Specifically, the effective
stimuli are \emph{shifted up} globally with the increase of the stimulating
intensity, while are \emph{drawn closer} with the increase of the coupling
strength. The dynamical responses of small-world and random complex networks to
external stimulus injected on the largest-degree neuron are also investigated,
which confirm the generality of the observed phenomena.

landscape of protein interacting patterns, enable us to explore biological
processes and cellular components at multiple resolutions. For a biological
process, a number of proteins need to work together to perform the job.
Proteins densely interact with each other, forming large molecular machines or
cellular building blocks. Identification of such densely interconnected
clusters or protein complexes from PPI networks enables us to obtain a better
understanding of the hierarchy and organization of biological processes and
cellular components. Most existing methods apply efficient graph clustering
algorithms on PPI networks, often failing to detect possible densely connected
subgraphs and overlapped subgraphs. Besides clustering-based methods, dense
subgraph enumeration methods have also been used, which aim to find all densely
connected protein sets. However, such methods are not practically tractable
even on a small yeast PPI network, due to high computational complexity. In
this paper, we introduce a novel approximate algorithm to efficiently enumerate
putative protein complexes from biological networks. The key insight of our
algorithm is that we do not need to enumerate all dense subgraphs. Instead we
only need to find a small subset of subgraphs that cover as many proteins as
possible. The problem is formulated as finding a diverse set of dense
subgraphs, where we develop highly effective pruning techniques to guarantee
efficiency. To handle large networks, we take a divide-and-conquer approach to
speed up the algorithm in a distributed manner. By comparing with existing
clustering and dense subgraph-based algorithms on several human and yeast PPI
networks, we demonstrate that our method can detect more putative protein
complexes and achieves better prediction accuracy.

  using Fragment Equivalence Classes"	"  Motivation: De novo transcriptome assembly of non-model organisms is the
first major step for many RNA-seq analysis tasks. Current methods for de novo
assembly often report a large number of contiguous sequences (contigs), which
may be fractured and incomplete sequences instead of full-length transcripts.
Dealing with a large number of such contigs can slow and complicate downstream
analysis.
  Results :We present a method for clustering contigs from de novo
transcriptome assemblies based upon the relationships exposed by multi-mapping
sequencing fragments. Specifically, we cast the problem of clustering contigs
as one of clustering a sparse graph that is induced by equivalence classes of
fragments that map to subsets of the transcriptome. Leveraging recent
developments in efficient read mapping and transcript quantification, we have
developed RapClust, a tool implementing this approach that is capable of
accurately clustering most large de novo transcriptomes in a matter of minutes,
while simultaneously providing accurate estimates of expression for the
resulting clusters. We compare RapClust against a number of tools commonly used
for de novo transcriptome clustering. Using de novo assemblies of organisms for
which reference genomes are available, we assess the accuracy of these
different methods in terms of the quality of the resulting clusterings, and the
concordance of differential expression tests with those based on ground truth
clusters. We find that RapClust produces clusters of comparable or better
quality than existing state-of-the-art approaches, and does so substantially
faster. RapClust also confers a large benefit in terms of space usage, as it
produces only succinct intermediate files - usually on the order of a few
megabytes - even when processing hundreds of millions of reads.

  ion channel and its disruption by mutations"	"  Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) of the Cys-loop superfamily are
important neuroreceptors that mediate fast synaptic transmission. They are
activated by the binding of a neurotransmitter, but the details of this process
are still not fully understood. As a prototypical pLGIC, here we choose the
insect resistance to dieldrin (RDL) receptor, involved in the resistance to
insecticides, and investigate the binding of the neurotransmitter GABA to its
extracellular domain at the atomistic level. We achieve this by means of
$\mu$-sec funnel-metadynamics simulations, which efficiently enhance the
sampling of bound and unbound states by using a funnel-shaped restraining
potential to limit the exploration in the solvent. We reveal the sequence of
events in the binding process, from the capture of GABA from the solvent to its
pinning between the charged residues Arg111 and Glu204 in the binding pocket.
We characterize the associated free energy landscapes in the wild-type RDL
receptor and in two mutant forms, where the key residues Arg111 and Glu204 are
mutated to Ala. Experimentally these mutations produce non-functional channels,
which is reflected in the reduced ligand binding affinities, due to the loss of
essential interactions. We also analyze the dynamical behaviour of the crucial
loop C, whose opening allows the access of GABA to the binding site, while its
closure locks the ligand into the protein. The RDL receptor shares structural
and functional features with other pLGICs, hence our work outlines a valuable
protocol to study the binding of ligands to pLGICs beyond conventional docking
and molecular dynamics techniques.

benefits the understanding of evolutionary relationship among species, helps
identify conserved sub-networks and provides extra information for functional

thus, new network alignment methods are needed. Result: In this paper, we
present a novel method, denoted as ConvexAlign, for joint alignment of multiple
PPI networks by convex optimization of a scoring function composed of sequence
similarity, topological score and interaction conservation score. In contrast
to existing methods that generate multiple alignments in a greedy or
progressive manner, our convex method optimizes alignments globally and
enforces consistency among all pairwise alignments, resulting in much better
alignment quality. Tested on both synthetic and real data, our experimental
results show that ConvexAlign outperforms several popular methods in producing
functionally coherent alignments. ConvexAlign even has a larger advantage over
the others in aligning real PPI networks. ConvexAlign also finds a few
conserved complexes among 5 species which cannot be detected by the other
methods.

1604.03532	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio.SC	A Computational Model of YAP/TAZ Mechanosensing	"  In cell proliferation, stem cell differentiation, chemoresistance and tissue
organization, the ubiquitous role of YAP/TAZ continues to impact our
fundamental understanding in numerous physiological and disease systems.
YAP/TAZ is an important signaling nexus integrating diverse mechanical and
biochemical signals, such as ECM stiffness, adhesion ligand density, or
cell-cell contacts, and thus strongly influences cell fate. Recent studies show
that YAP/TAZ mechanical sensing is dependent on RhoA-regulated stress fibers.
However, current understanding of YAP/TAZ still remains limited due to the
unknown interaction between the canonical Hippo pathway and cell tension. To
identify the roles of key signaling molecules in mechanical signal sensing and
transduction, we present a novel computational model of the YAP/TAZ signaling
pathway. This model converts ECM mechanical properties to biochemical signals
via adhesion, and integrates intracellular signaling cascades associated with
cytoskeleton dynamics. Adhesion molecules, such as FAK, are predicted to rescue
YAP/TAZ activity in soft environments via the RhoA pathway. We found that
changes of molecule concentrations result in different pattern of YAP/TAZ
stiffness response. We also investigate the sensitivity of YAP/TAZ activity to
ECM stiffness. In addition, the model shows that the unresolved synergistic
effect of YAP/TAZ activity between the mechanosensing and the Hippo pathways
can be explained by the interaction of LIMK and LATS. Overall, our model
provides a novel platform for studying YAP/TAZ activity in the context of
integrating different signaling pathways. This platform can be used to gain new
fundamental insights into roles of key molecular and mechanical regulators on
development, tissue engineering or tumor progression.

  models"	"  Circadian (~24hr) clocks are self-sustained endogenous oscillators with which
organisms keep track of daily and seasonal time. Circadian clocks frequently
rely on interlocked transcriptional- translational feedback loops to generate
rhythms that are robust against intrinsic and extrinsic perturbations. To
investigate the dynamics and mechanisms of the intracellular feedback loops in
circadian clocks, a number of mathematical models have been developed. The
majority of the models use Hill functions to describe transcriptional
repression in a way that is similar to the Goodwin model. Recently, a new class
of models with protein sequestration-based repression has been introduced.
Here, we discuss how this new class of models differs dramatically from those
based on Hill-type repression in several fundamental aspects: conditions for
rhythm generation, robust network designs and the periods of coupled
oscillators. Consistently, these fundamental properties of circadian clocks
also differ among Neurospora, Drosophila, and mammals depending on their key
transcriptional repression mechanisms (Hill-type repression or protein
sequestration). Based on both theoretical and experimental studies, this review
highlights the importance of careful modeling of transcriptional repression
mechanisms in molecular circadian clocks.

thinly slicing and staining the brain, and then imaging each individual section
with visible light photons or electrons. In contrast, X-rays can be used to
image thick samples, providing a rapid approach for producing large 3D brain
maps without sectioning. Here we demonstrate the use of synchrotron X-ray
microtomography ($\mu$CT) for producing mesoscale $(1~\mu m^3)$ resolution
brain maps from millimeter-scale volumes of mouse brain. We introduce a
pipeline for $\mu$CT-based brain mapping that combines methods for sample
preparation, imaging, automated segmentation of image volumes into cells and
blood vessels, and statistical analysis of the resulting brain structures. Our
results demonstrate that X-ray tomography promises rapid quantification of
large brain volumes, complementing other brain mapping and connectomics
efforts.

  beneficial and deleterious mutations on additive fitness landscapes"	"  We study a continuous time model for the frequency distribution of an
infinitely large asexual population in which both beneficial and deleterious
mutations occur and the fitness is additive. When beneficial mutations are
ignored, the exact solution for the frequency distribution is known to be a
Poisson distribution. Here we include beneficial mutations and obtain exact
expressions for the frequency distribution at all times using an eigenfunction
expansion method. We find that the stationary distribution is non-Poissonian
and related to the Bessel function of the first kind. We also provide suitable
approximations for the stationary distribution and the time to relax to the
steady state. Our exact results, especially at mutation-selection equilibrium,
can be useful in developing semi-deterministic approaches to understand
stochastic evolution.

  protection"	"  In the face of serious infectious diseases, governments endeavour to
implement containment measures such as public vaccination at a macroscopic
level. Meanwhile, individuals tend to protect themselves by avoiding contacts
with infections at a microscopic level. However, a comprehensive understanding
of how such combined strategy influences epidemic dynamics is still lacking. We
study a susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model with imperfect
vaccination on dynamic contact networks, where the macroscopic intervention is
represented by random vaccination of the population and the microscopic
protection is characterised by susceptible individuals rewiring contacts from
infective neighbours. In particular, the model is formulated both in
populations without and then with demographic effects. Using the pairwise
approximation and the probability generating function approach, we investigate
both dynamics of the epidemic and the underlying network. For populations
without demography, the emerging degree correlations, bistable states, and
oscillations demonstrate the combined effects of the public vaccination program
and individual protective behavior. Compared to either strategy in isolation,
the combination of public vaccination and individual protection is more
effective in preventing and controlling the spread of infectious diseases by
increasing both the invasion threshold and the persistence threshold. For
populations with additional demographic factors, the integration between
vaccination intervention and individual rewiring may promote epidemic spreading
due to the birth effect. Moreover, the degree distributions of both networks in
the steady state is closely related to the degree distribution of newborns,
which leads to uncorrelated connectivity. All the results demonstrate the
importance of both local protection and global intervention, as well as the
demographic effects.

  cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion determines the pattern of junctional
  tension in epithelial cell aggregates"	"  We generated a computational approach to analyze the biomechanics of
epithelial cell aggregates, either island or stripes or entire monolayers, that
combines both vertex and contact-inhibition-of-locomotion models to include
both cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion. Examination of the distribution of
cell protrusions (adhesion to the substrate) in the model predicted high order
profiles of cell organization that agree with those previously seen
experimentally. Cells acquired an asymmetric distribution of basal protrusions,
traction forces and apical aspect ratios that decreased when moving from the
edge to the island center. Our in silico analysis also showed that tension on
cell-cell junctions and apical stress is not homogeneous across the island.
Instead, these parameters are higher at the island center and scales up with
island size, which we confirmed experimentally using laser ablation assays and
immunofluorescence. Without formally being a 3-dimensional model, our approach
has the minimal elements necessary to reproduce the distribution of cellular
forces and mechanical crosstalk as well as distribution of principal stress in
cells within epithelial cell aggregates. By making experimental testable
predictions, our approach would benefit the mechanical analysis of epithelial
tissues, especially when local changes in cell-cell and/or cell-substrate
adhesion drive collective cell behavior.

arterial wall is an important factor for understanding mechanisms of
atherosclerosis. It has been experimentally observed that the increased
pressure leads to the higher level of the LDL inside the wall. In this paper we
attempt to construct a model of the LDL transport which reproduces
quantitatively experimental outcomes. We supplement the well known four-layer
arterial wall model to include two pressure induced effects: the compression of
the intima tissue and the increase of the fraction of leaky junctions. We
demonstrate that such model can reach the very good agreement with experimental
data.

1604.03834	q-bio	q-bio.QM q-bio.BM q-bio.NC q-bio.TO	A Possible Link Between Pyriproxyfen and Microcephaly	"  The Zika virus is the primary suspect in the large increase in microcephaly
cases in 2015-6 in Brazil, however its role is unconfirmed despite individual
cases of viral infections found in neural tissue. Here we consider the
alternative that the insecticide pyriproxyfen, used in Brazilian drinking water
for mosquito control, may actually be the cause. Pyriproxifen is an analog of
juvenile hormone, which corresponds in mammals to regulatory molecules
including retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite, with which it has
cross-reactivity and whose application during development causes microcephaly.
Methoprene, another juvenile hormone analog approved as an insecticide has
metabolites that bind to the retinoid X receptor, and causes developmental
disorders in mammals. Isotretinoin is another example of a retinoid causing
microcephaly in human babies via activation of the retinoid X receptor.
Moreover, tests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer, Sumitomo, widely quoted as
giving no evidence for developmental toxicity, actually found some evidence for
such an effect, including low brain mass and arhinencephaly--incomplete
formation of the anterior cerebral hemispheres--in rat pups. Finally, the
pyriproxyfen use in Brazil is unprecedented--it has never before been applied
to a water supply on such a scale. Claims that it is not being used in Recife,
the epicenter of microcephaly cases, do not distinguish the metropolitan area
of Recife, where it is widely used, and the municipality, where it is not.
Given this combination of information we strongly recommend that the use of
pyriproxyfen in Brazil be suspended pending further investigation.

crosslinked semiflexible filaments, spanning the full range between flexible
entropy-driven chains to stiff athermal rods. We choose the 3-chain
constitutive model over several plausible candidates, and derive analytical
expressions for the elastic energy at arbitrary strain, with the corresponding
stress-strain relationship. The theory fits well to a wide range of
experimental data on simple shear in different filament networks,
quantitatively matching the differential shear modulus variation with stress,
with only two adjustable parameters (which represent the filament stiffness and
pre-tension in the network, respectively). The general theory accurately
describes the crossover between the positive and negative Poynting effect
(normal stress on imposed shear) on increasing the stiffness of filaments
forming the network.

1604.04008	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Prevention and control of Zika fever as a mosquito-borne and sexually
  transmitted disease"	"  The ongoing Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic poses a major global public health
emergency. It is known that ZIKV is spread by \textit{Aedes} mosquitoes, recent
studies show that ZIKV can also be transmitted via sexual contact and cases of
sexually transmitted ZIKV have been confirmed in the U.S., France, and Italy.
How sexual transmission affects the spread and control of ZIKV infection is not
well-understood. We presented a mathematical model to investigate the impact of
mosquito-borne and sexual transmission on spread and control of ZIKV and used
the model to fit the ZIKV data in Brazil, Colombia, and El Salvador. Based on
the estimated parameter values, we calculated the median and confidence
interval of the basic reproduction number R0=2.055 (95% CI: 0.523-6.300), in
which the distribution of the percentage of contribution by sexual transmission
is 3.044 (95% CI: 0.123-45.73). Our study indicates that R0 is most sensitive
to the biting rate and mortality rate of mosquitoes while sexual transmission
increases the risk of infection and epidemic size and prolongs the outbreak. In
order to prevent and control the transmission of ZIKV, it must be treated as
not only a mosquito-borne disease but also a sexually transmitted disease.

1604.04145	q-bio	q-bio.PE math.PR	"A coalescent dual process for a Wright-Fisher diffusion with
  recombination and its application to haplotype partitioning"	"  Duality plays an important role in population genetics. It can relate results
from forwards-in-time models of allele frequency evolution with those of
backwards-in-time genealogical models; a well known example is the duality
between the Wright-Fisher diffusion for genetic drift and its genealogical
counterpart, the coalescent. There have been a number of articles extending
this relationship to include other evolutionary processes such as mutation and
selection, but little has been explored for models also incorporating crossover
recombination. Here, we derive from first principles a new genealogical process
which is dual to a Wright-Fisher diffusion model of drift, mutation, and
recombination. Our approach is based on expressing a putative duality
relationship between two models via their infinitesimal generators, and then
seeking an appropriate test function to ensure the validity of the duality
equation. This approach is quite general, and we use it to find dualities for
several important variants, including both a discrete L-locus model of a gene
and a continuous model in which mutation and recombination events are scattered
along the gene according to continuous distributions. As an application of our
results, we derive a series expansion for the transition function of the
diffusion. Finally, we study in further detail the case in which mutation is
absent. Then the dual process describes the dispersal of ancestral genetic
material across the ancestors of a sample. The stationary distribution of this
process is of particular interest; we show how duality relates this
distribution to haplotype fixation probabilities. We develop an efficient
method for computing such probabilities in multilocus models.

1604.04177	q-bio	math.AP math.NA q-bio.CB	Traveling Pulses for a Two-Species Chemotaxis Model	"  Mathematical models have been widely used to describe the collective movement
of bacteria by chemotaxis. In particular, bacterial concentration waves
traveling in a narrow channel have been experimentally observed and can be
precisely described thanks to a mathematical model at the macroscopic scale.
Such model was derived in [1] using a kinetic model based on an accurate
description of the mesoscopic run-and-tumble process. We extend this approach
to study the behavior of the interaction between two populations of E. Coli.
Separately, each population travels with its own speed in the channel. When put
together, a synchronization of the speed of the traveling pulses can be
observed. We show that this synchronization depends on the fraction of the fast
population. Our approach is based on mathematical analysis of a macroscopic
model of partial differential equations. Numerical simulations in comparison
with experimental observations show qualitative agreement.

1604.04214	q-bio	q-bio.NC q-bio.PE	Toward an Evolutionary-Predictive Foundation for Creativity	"  Dietrich and Haider (2014) justify their integrative framework for creativity
founded on evolutionary theory and prediction research on the grounds that
""theories and approaches guiding empirical research on creativity have not been
supported by the neuroimaging evidence"". Although this justification is
controversial, the general direction holds promise. This commentary clarifies
points of disagreement and unresolved issues, and addresses mis-applications of
evolutionary theory that lead the authors to adopt a Darwinian (versus
Lamarckian) approach. To say that creativity is Darwinian is not to say that it
consists of variation plus selection---in the everyday sense of the term---as
the authors imply; it is to say that evolution is occurring because selection
is affecting the distribution of randomly generated heritable variation across
generations. In creative thought the distribution of variants is not key, i.e.,
one is not inclined toward idea A because 60% of one's candidate ideas are
variants of A while only 40% are variants of B; one is inclined toward
whichever seems best. The authors concede that creative variation is partly
directed; however, the greater the extent to which variants are generated
non-randomly, the greater the extent to which the distribution of variants can
reflect not selection but the initial generation bias. Since each thought in a
creative process can alter the selective criteria against which the next is
evaluated, there is no demarcation into generations as assumed in a Darwinian
model. We address the authors' claim that reduced variability and individuality
are more characteristic of Lamarckism than Darwinian evolution, and note that a
Lamarckian approach to creativity has addressed the challenge of modeling the
emergent features associated with insight.

1604.04270	q-bio	physics.soc-ph cond-mat.stat-mech cs.GT q-bio.PE	Collective influence in evolutionary social dilemmas	"  When evolutionary games are contested in structured populations, the degree
of each player in the network plays an important role. If they exist, hubs
often determine the fate of the population in remarkable ways. Recent research
based on optimal percolation in random networks has shown, however, that the
degree is neither the sole nor the best predictor of influence in complex
networks. Low-degree nodes may also be optimal influencers if they are
hierarchically linked to hubs. Taking this into account leads to the formalism
of collective influence in complex networks, which as we show here, has
far-reaching implications for the favorable resolution of social dilemmas. In
particular, there exists an optimal hierarchical depth for the determination of
collective influence that we use to describe the potency of players for passing
their strategies, which depends on the strength of the social dilemma.
Interestingly, the degree, which corresponds to the baseline depth zero, is
optimal only when the temptation to defect is small. Our research reveals that
evolutionary success stories are related to spreading processes which are
rooted in favorable hierarchical structures that extend beyond local
neighborhoods.

1604.04280	q-bio	q-bio.GN stat.ML	"Variational inference for rare variant detection in deep, heterogeneous
  next-generation sequencing data"	"  The detection of rare variants is important for understanding the genetic
heterogeneity in mixed samples. Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS)
technologies have enabled the identification of single nucleotide variants
(SNVs) in mixed samples with high resolution. Yet, the noise inherent in the
biological processes involved in next-generation sequencing necessitates the
use of statistical methods to identify true rare variants. We propose a novel
Bayesian statistical model and a variational expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm to estimate non-reference allele frequency (NRAF) and identify SNVs
in heterogeneous cell populations. We demonstrate that our variational EM
algorithm has comparable sensitivity and specificity compared with a Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling inference algorithm, and is more
computationally efficient on tests of low coverage ($27\times$ and $298\times$)
data. Furthermore, we show that our model with a variational EM inference
algorithm has higher specificity than many state-of-the-art algorithms. In an
analysis of a directed evolution longitudinal yeast data set, we are able to
identify a time-series trend in non-reference allele frequency and detect novel
variants that have not yet been reported. Our model also detects the emergence
of a beneficial variant earlier than was previously shown, and a pair of
concomitant variants.

membrane recycling, i.e. active exchange of material with the cytosol. We
propose an analytically tractable model of biomembrane predicting the effects
of recycling on the size of protein nanodomains. It includes a short-range
attraction between proteins and a weaker long-range repulsion which ensures the
existence of so-called cluster phases at equilibrium, where monomeric proteins
coexist with finite-size domains. Our main finding is that when taking
recycling into account, the typical cluster size increases logarithmically with
the recycling rate. Using physically realistic model parameters, the predicted
two-fold increase due to recycling in living cells is very likely
experimentally measurable with the help of super-resolution microscopy.

infectious diseases spread. Various methods to gather data on such contacts
co-exist, from surveys to wearable sensors. Comparisons of data obtained by
different methods in the same context are however scarce, in particular with
respect to their use in data-driven models of spreading processes. Here, we use
a combined data set describing contacts registered by sensors and friendship
relations in the same population to address this issue in a case study. We
investigate if the use of the friendship network is equivalent to a sampling
procedure performed on the sensor contact network with respect to the outcome
of simulations of spreading processes: such an equivalence might indeed give
hints on ways to compensate for the incompleteness of contact data deduced from
surveys. We show that this is indeed the case for these data, for a
specifically designed sampling procedure, in which respondents report their
neighbors with a probability depending on their contact time. We study the
impact of this specific sampling procedure on several data sets, discuss
limitations of our approach and its possible applications in the use of data
sets of various origins in data-driven simulations of epidemic processes.

perform genomewide association studies (GWAS) on a larger scale and at a lower
cost than ever before. Due to privacy concerns, however, access to this data is
limited to a few trusted individuals, greatly reducing its impact on biomedical
research. Privacy preserving methods have been suggested as a way of allowing
more people access to this precious data while protecting patients. In
particular, there has been growing interest in applying the concept of
differential privacy to GWAS results. Unfortunately, previous approaches for
performing differentially private GWAS are based on rather simple statistics
that have some major limitations. In particular, they do not correct for
population stratification, a major issue when dealing with the genetically
diverse populations present in modern GWAS. To address this concern we
introduce a novel computational framework for performing GWAS that tailors
ideas from differential privacy to protect private phenotype information, while
at the same time correcting for population stratification. This framework
allows us to produce privacy preserving GWAS results based on two of the most
commonly used GWAS statistics: EIGENSTRAT and linear mixed model (LMM) based
statistics. We test our differentially private statistics, PrivSTRAT and
PrivLMM, on both simulated and real GWAS datasets and find that they are able
to protect privacy while returning meaningful GWAS results.

1604.04496	q-bio	physics.soc-ph nlin.AO q-bio.PE	Spatial Structure and Scaling of Agricultural Networks	"  Considering agricultural landscapes as networks can provide information about
spatial connectivity relevant for a wide range of applications including
pollination, pest management, and ecology. Global agricultural networks are
well-described by power law rank-size distributions. However, regional analyses
capture only a subset of the total global network. Most analyses are regional.
In this paper, we seek to address the following questions: Does the globally
observed scale-free property of agricultural networks hold over smaller spatial
domains? Can similar properties be observed at kilometer to meter scales? We
analyze 9 intensively cultivated Landsat scenes on 5 continents with a wide
range of vegetation distributions. We find that networks of vegetation fraction
within the domain of each of these Landsat scenes exhibit substantial
variability - but still possess similar scaling properties to the global
distribution of agriculture. We also find similar results using a 39 km2 IKONOS
image. To illustrate an application of spatial network analysis, we show an
example of network disruption. We compare two networks with similar rank-size
distributions that behave differently when nodes are progressively removed. We
suggest that treating agricultural land cover as spatial networks can provide a
straightforward way of characterizing the connectivity of complex spatial
distributions of agriculture across a wide range of landscapes and at spatial
scales relevant for practical agricultural applications.

  structure is small"	"  When controlling an emerging outbreak of an infectious disease it is
essential to know the key epidemiological parameters, such as the basic
reproduction number $R_0$ and the control effort required to prevent a large
outbreak. These parameters are estimated from the observed incidence of new
cases and information about the infectious contact structures of the population
in which the disease spreads. However, the relevant infectious contact
structures for new, emerging infections are often unknown or hard to obtain.
Here we show that for many common true underlying heterogeneous contact
structures, the simplification to neglect such structures and instead assume
that all contacts are made homogeneously in the whole population, results in
conservative estimates for $R_0$ and the required control effort. This means
that robust control policies can be planned during the early stages of an
outbreak, using such conservative estimates of the required control effort.

paper, this model is analyzed by determining all infection-free steady states
and studying the local stability properties of the unique biologically-relevant
equilibrium. Active subspace methods are then used to perform a global
sensitivity analysis and study the dependence of an infected individual's
T-cell count on the parameter space. Building on these results, a
global-in-time approximation of the T-cell count is created by constructing
dynamic active subspaces and reduced order models are generated, thereby
allowing for inexpensive computation.

failed or insufficient lymphangiogenesis, that is the formation of new
lymphatic capillaries. Although many mathematical models have been developed to
describe the formation of blood capillaries (angiogenesis), very few have been
proposed for the regeneration of the lymphatic network. Lymphangiogenesis is a
markedly different process from angiogenesis, occurring at different times and
in response to different chemical stimuli. Two main hypotheses have been
proposed: 1) lymphatic capillaries sprout from existing interrupted ones at the
edge of the wound in analogy to the blood angiogenesis case; 2) lymphatic
endothelial cells first pool in the wound region following the lymph flow and
then, once sufficiently populated, start to form a network. Here we present two
PDE models describing lymphangiogenesis according to these two different
hypotheses. Further, we include the effect of advection due to interstitial
flow and lymph flow coming from open capillaries. The variables represent
different cell densities and growth factor concentrations, and where possible
the parameters are estimated from biological data. The models are then solved
numerically and the results are compared with the available biological
literature.

conceptual model we are giving a cogent rationale to previous theoretical and
experimental reports of asymmetrical vibrational energy diffusion in proteins

Energy Relaxation in molecules: (i) the vibrational energy flows form a soft
site to a hard site but not in the opposite direction, (ii) when vibrational
energy is injected directly to a hard site, it is trapped in this site, and
(iii) if the vibrational energy is pump in a polarizable site and two sites
with different softness are available, the energy will propagate to the softest
one.

  inhibition of spiking by weak noise and analysis with moment equations"	"  We consider a classical space-clamped Hodgkin-Huxley model neuron stimulated
by synaptic excitation and inhibition with conductances represented by
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. Using numerical solutions of the stochastic model
system obtained by an Euler method, it is found that with excitation only there
is a critical value of the steady state excitatory conductance for repetitive
spiking without noise and for values of the conductance near the critical value
small noise has a powerfully inhibitory effect. For a given level of inhibition
there is also a critical value of the steady state excitatory conductance for
repetitive firing and it is demonstrated that noise either in the excitatory or
inhibitory processes or both can powerfully inhibit spiking. Furthermore, near
the critical value, inverse stochastic resonance was observed when noise was
present only in the inhibitory input process.
  The system of 27 coupled deterministic differential equations for the
approximate first and second order moments of the 6-dimensional model is
derived. The moment differential equations are solved using Runge-Kutta methods
and the solutions are compared with the results obtained by simulation for
various sets of parameters including some with conductances obtained by
experiment on pyramidal cells of rat prefrontal cortex. The mean and variance
obtained from simulation are in good agreement when there is spiking induced by
strong stimulation and relatively small noise or when the voltage is
fluctuating at subthreshold levels. In the occasional spike mode sometimes
exhibited by spinal motoneurons and cortical pyramidal cells the assunptions
underlying the moment equation approach are not satisfied.

noncontextuality, and these conditions are known to be breached in certain
quantum systems. We apply the theory of cyclic systems to a psychophysical
double-detection experiment, in which observers were asked to determine
presence or absence of a signal property in each of two simultaneously
presented stimuli. The results, as in all other behavioral and social systems
previous analyzed, indicate lack of contextuality. The role of context in

1604.04803	q-bio	q-bio.GN	"A frame-based representation of genomic sequences for removing errors
  and rare variant detection in NGS data"	"  We propose a frame-based representation of k-mers for detecting sequencing
errors and rare variants in next generation sequencing data obtained from
populations of closely related genomes. Frames are sets of non-orthogonal basis
functions, traditionally used in signal processing for noise removal. We define
a frame for genomes and sequenced reads to consist of discrete spatial signals
of every k-mer of a given size. We show that each k-mer in the sequenced data
can be projected onto multiple frames and these projections are maximized for
spatial signals corresponding to the k-mer's substrings. Our proposed
classifier, MultiRes, is trained on the projections of k-mers as features used
for marking k-mers as erroneous or true variations in the genome. We evaluate
MultiRes on simulated and real viral population datasets and compare it to
other error correction methods known in the literature. MultiRes has 4 to 500
times less false positives k-mer predictions compared to other methods,
essential for accurate estimation of viral population diversity and their
de-novo assembly. It has high recall of the true k-mers, comparable to other
error correction methods. MultiRes also has greater than 95% recall for
detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), fewer false positive SNPs,
while detecting higher number of rare variants compared to other variant
calling methods for viral populations. The software is freely available from
the GitHub link (https://github.com/raunaq-m/MultiRes).

  media"	"  Brillouin microscopy has recently emerged as powerful technique to
characterize the mechanical properties of biological tissue, cell and
biomaterials. However, the potential of Brillouin microscopy is currently
limited to transparent samples, because Brillouin spectrometers do not have
sufficient spectral extinction to reject the predominant non-Brillouin
scattered light of turbid media. To overcome this issue, we developed a
spectrometer composed of a two VIPA stages and a multi-pass Fabry-Perot
interferometer. The Fabry-Perot etalon acts as an ultra-narrow band-pass filter
for Brillouin light with high spectral extinction and low loss. We report
background-free Brillouin spectra from Intralipid solutions and up to 100
microns deep within chicken muscle tissue.

1604.04883	q-bio	q-bio.PE math.PR	The invariances of power law size distributions	"  Size varies. Small things are typically more frequent than large things. The
logarithm of frequency often declines linearly with the logarithm of size. That
power law relation forms one of the common patterns of nature. Why does the
complexity of nature reduce to such a simple pattern? Why do things as
different as tree size and enzyme rate follow similarly simple patterns? Here I
analyze such patterns by their invariant properties. For example, a common
pattern should not change when adding a constant value to all observations.
That shift is essentially the renumbering of the points on a ruler without
changing the metric information provided by the ruler. A ruler is shift
invariant only when its scale is properly calibrated to the pattern being
measured. Stretch invariance corresponds to the conservation of the total
amount of something, such as the total biomass and consequently the average
size. Rotational invariance corresponds to pattern that does not depend on the
order in which underlying processes occur, for example, a scale that additively
combines the component processes leading to observed values. I use tree size as
an example to illustrate how the key invariances shape pattern. A simple
interpretation of common pattern follows. That simple interpretation connects
the normal distribution to a wide variety of other common patterns through the
transformations of scale set by the fundamental invariances.

3D fluorescence microscopy imaging experiments, however, prohibit a
comprehensive manual ground truth generation. Moreover, existing simulated
benchmarks in this field are often too simple or too specialized to
sufficiently validate the observed image analysis problems. We present a new
semi-synthetic approach to generate realistic 3D+t benchmarks that combines
challenging cellular movement dynamics of real embryos with simulated
fluorescent nuclei and artificial image distortions including various
parametrizable options like cell numbers, acquisition deficiencies or multiview
simulations. We successfully applied the approach to simulate the development
of a zebrafish embryo with thousands of cells over 14 hours of its early

  Decrease?"	"  The mutant allele frequencies in oncogenes peak around 0.40 and rapidly
decrease. In this article, we explain why this is the case. Invoking a key
result from mathematical analysis in our model, namely, the inverse function
theorem, we estimate the selection pressures of the mutations as a function of
germline allele frequencies. Under complete dominance of oncogenic mutations,
this selection function is expected to be linearly correlated with the
distribution of the mutant alleles. We demonstrate that this is the case by
investigating the allele frequencies of mutations in oncogenes across various
cancer types, validating our model for mean effective selection. Consistent
with the population genetics model of fitness, the selection function fits a
gamma distribution curve that accurately describes the trend of the mutant
allele frequencies. While existing equations for selection explain evolution at
low allele frequencies, our equations are general formulas for natural
selection under complete dominance operating at all frequencies. We show that
selection exhibits linear behavior at all times, favoring dominant alleles with
respect to the change in recessive allele frequency. Also, these equations
show, selection behaves like power-law against the recessive alleles at low
dominant allele frequency.

1604.04936	q-bio	q-bio.PE cond-mat.stat-mech math.PR	"Universal asymptotic clone size distribution for general population
  growth"	"  Deterministically growing (wild-type) populations which seed stochastically
developing mutant clones have found an expanding number of applications from
microbial populations to cancer. The special case of exponential wild-type
population growth, usually termed the Luria-Delbr\""uck or Lea-Coulson model, is
often assumed but seldom realistic. In this article we generalise this model to
different types of wild-type population growth, with mutants evolving as a
birth-death branching process. Our focus is on the size distribution of clones
- that is the number of progeny of a founder mutant - which can be mapped to
the total number of mutants. Exact expressions are derived for exponential,
power-law and logistic population growth. Additionally for a large class of
population growth we prove that the long time limit of the clone size
distribution has a general two-parameter form, whose tail decays as a
power-law. Considering metastases in cancer as the mutant clones, upon
analysing a data-set of their size distribution, we indeed find that a
power-law tail is more likely than an exponential one.

  mathematical modelling and simulations"	"  We propose a multiscale model of the invasion of the extracellular matrix by
two types of cancer cells, the differentiated cancer cells and the cancer stem
cells. We assume that the epithelial mesenchymal-like transition between them
is driven primarily by the epidermal growth factors. We moreover take into
account the transidifferentiation program of the cancer stem cells and the
cancer associated fibroblast cells as well as the fibroblast-driven remodelling
of the extracellular matrix.
  The proposed haptotaxis model combines the macroscopic phenomenon of the
invasion of the extracellular matrix with the microscopic dynamics of the
epidermal growth factors. We analyse our model in a component-wise manner and
compare our findings with the literature. We investigate pathological
situations regarding the epidermal growth factors and accordingly propose
""mathematical-treatment"" scenarios to control the aggressiveness of the tumour.

neuromorphic hardware systems: to enable flexibility in implementable learning
mechanisms while keeping high efficiency associated with neuromorphic
implementations, we combine a general-purpose processor with full-custom analog
elements.
  This processor is operating in parallel with a fully parallel neuromorphic
system consisting of an array of synapses connected to analog, continuous time
neuron circuits. Novel analog correlation sensor circuits process spike events
for each synapse in parallel and in real-time.
  The processor uses this pre-processing to compute new weights possibly using
additional information following its program.
  Therefore, learning rules can be defined in software giving a large degree of
flexibility.
  Synapses realize correlation detection geared towards Spike-Timing Dependent
Plasticity (STDP) as central computational primitive in the analog domain.
  Operating at a speed-up factor of 1000 compared to biological time-scale, we
measure time-constants from tens to hundreds of micro-seconds.
  We analyze variability across multiple chips and demonstrate learning using a
multiplicative STDP rule.
  We conclude, that the presented approach will enable flexible and efficient
learning as a platform for neuroscientific research and technological
applications.

1604.05082	q-bio	q-bio.TO	"Why one-size-fits-all vaso-modulatory interventions fail to control
  glioma invasion: in silico insights"	"  There is an ongoing debate on the therapeutic potential of vaso-modulatory
interventions against glioma invasion. Prominent vasculature-targeting
therapies involve functional tumour-associated blood vessel deterioration and
normalisation. The former aims at tumour infarction and nutrient deprivation
medi- ated by vascular targeting agents that induce occlusion/collapse of
tumour blood vessels. In contrast, the therapeutic intention of normalising the
abnormal structure and function of tumour vascular net- works, e.g. via
alleviating stress-induced vaso-occlusion, is to improve chemo-, immuno- and
radiation therapy efficacy. Although both strategies have shown therapeutic
potential, it remains unclear why they often fail to control glioma invasion
into the surrounding healthy brain tissue. To shed light on this issue, we
propose a mathematical model of glioma invasion focusing on the interplay
between the mi- gration/proliferation dichotomy (Go-or-Grow) of glioma cells
and modulations of the functional tumour vasculature. Vaso-modulatory
interventions are modelled by varying the degree of vaso-occlusion. We
discovered the existence of a critical cell proliferation/diffusion ratio that
separates glioma invasion re- sponses to vaso-modulatory interventions into two
distinct regimes. While for tumours, belonging to one regime, vascular
modulations reduce the tumour front speed and increase the infiltration width,
for those in the other regime the invasion speed increases and infiltration
width decreases. We show how these in silico findings can be used to guide
individualised approaches of vaso-modulatory treatment strategies and thereby
improve success rates.

1604.05102	q-bio	q-bio.QM	Multi-level methods and approximating distribution functions	"  Biochemical reaction networks are often modelled using discrete-state,
continuous-time Markov chains. System statistics of these Markov chains usually
cannot be calculated analytically and therefore estimates must be generated via
simulation techniques. There is a well documented class of simulation
techniques known as exact stochastic simulation algorithms, an example of which
is Gillespie's direct method. These algorithms often come with high
computational costs, therefore approximate stochastic simulation algorithms
such as the tau-leap method are used. However, in order to minimise the bias in
the estimates generated using them, a relatively small value of tau is needed,
rendering the computational costs comparable to Gillespie's direct method.
  The multi-level Monte Carlo method (Anderson and Higham, Multiscale Model.
Simul. 10:146-179, 2012) provides a reduction in computational costs whilst
minimising or even eliminating the bias in the estimates of system statistics.
This is achieved by first crudely approximating required statistics with many
sample paths of low accuracy. Then correction terms are added until a required
level of accuracy is reached. Recent literature has primarily focussed on
implementing the multi-level method efficiently to estimate a single system
statistic. However, it is clearly also of interest to be able to approximate
entire probability distributions of species counts. We present two novel
methods that combine known techniques for distribution reconstruction with the
multi-level method. We demonstrate the potential of our methods using a number
of examples.

1604.05129	q-bio	q-bio.NC cs.AI stat.ML	Memory shapes time perception and intertemporal choices	"  There is a consensus that human and non-human subjects experience temporal
distortions in many stages of their perceptual and decision-making systems.
Similarly, intertemporal choice research has shown that decision-makers
undervalue future outcomes relative to immediate ones. Here we combine
techniques from information theory and artificial intelligence to show how both
temporal distortions and intertemporal choice preferences can be explained as a
consequence of the coding efficiency of sensorimotor representation. In
particular, the model implies that interactions that constrain future behavior
are perceived as being both longer in duration and more valuable. Furthermore,
using simulations of artificial agents, we investigate how memory constraints
enforce a renormalization of the perceived timescales. Our results show that
qualitatively different discount functions, such as exponential and hyperbolic
discounting, arise as a consequence of an agent's probabilistic model of the
world.

diversity of molecular assays that can be now be implemented in a high
throughput manner. Such assays can sample the genome, epigenome, proteome,
metabolome and microbiome contemporaneously, allowing us for the first time to
perform a complete analysis of physiological activity. The central problem
remains empowering the scientific community to actually implement such an
integration, across seemingly diverse data types and measurements. One
promising solution is to apply semantic techniques on a self-consistent and
implicitly correct ontological representation of these data types. In this
paper we describe how we have applied one such solution, based around the
InterMine data warehouse platform which uses as its basis the Sequence
Ontology, to facilitate a systems biology analysis of virulence in the
apicomplexan pathogen $Toxoplasma~gondii$, a common parasite that infects up to
half the worlds population, with acute pathogenic risks for immuno-compromised
individuals or pregnant mothers. Our solution, which we named `toxoMine', has
provided both a platform for our collaborators to perform such integrative
analyses and also opportunities for such cyberinfrastructure to be further
developed, particularly to take advantage of possible semantic similarities of
value to knowledge discovery in the Omics enterprise. We discuss these
opportunities in the context of further enhancing the capabilities of this
powerful integrative platform.

tree topology from unrooted topological gene trees. While its statistical
consistency under the multispecies coalescent model was established only for a
4-taxon tree, simulations demonstrated its good performance on gene trees
inferred from sequences for many taxa. Here we prove the statistical
consistency of the method for an arbitrarily large species tree. Our approach
connects $\text{NJ}_{st}$ to a generalization of the STAR method of Liu, Pearl
and Edwards, and a previous theoretical analysis of it. We further show
$\text{NJ}_{st}$ utilizes only the distribution of splits in the gene trees,
and not their individual topologies. Finally, we discuss how multiple samples
per taxon per gene should be handled for statistical consistency.

systems where the Linear Noise Approximation can be written in singular

obtain a reduced order model that approximates the slow variable dynamics of
the original system. In particular, we show that, on a finite time-interval,
the first and second moments of the reduced system are within an
$O(\epsilon)$-neighborhood of the first and second moments of the slow variable
dynamics of the original system. The approach is illustrated on an example of a
biomolecular system that exhibits time-scale separation.

aims to find regions of similarities between molecular networks (rather than
sequences) of different species. NA can be either local (LNA) or global (GNA).
LNA aims to identify highly conserved common subnetworks, which are typically
small, while GNA aims to identify large common subnetworks, which are typically
suboptimally conserved. We recently showed that LNA and GNA yield complementary
results: LNA has high functional but low topological alignment quality, while
GNA has high topological but low functional alignment quality. Thus, we propose
IGLOO, a new approach that integrates GNA and LNA in hope to reconcile the two.
We evaluate IGLOO against state-of-the-art LNA (NetworkBLAST, NetAligner,
AlignNemo, and AlignMCL) and GNA (GHOST, NETAL, GEDEVO, MAGNA++, WAVE, and
L-GRAAL) methods. We show that IGLOO allows for a trade-off between topological

1604.06131	q-bio	physics.bio-ph cond-mat.soft physics.comp-ph physics.flu-dyn q-bio.CB	Amoeboid swimming in a channel	"  Several micro-organisms, such as bacteria, algae, or spermatozoa, use
flagella or cilia to swim in a fluid, while many other micro-organisms instead
use ample shape deformation, described as amoeboid, to propel themselves by
either crawling on a substrate or swimming. Many eukaryotic cells were believed
to require an underlying substratum to migrate (crawl) by using membrane
deformation (like blebbing or generation of lamellipodia) but there is now
increasing evidence that a large variety of cells (including those of the
immune system) can migrate without the assistance of focal adhesion, allowing
them to swim as efficiently as they can crawl. This paper details the analysis
of amoeboid swimming in a confined fluid by modeling the swimmer as an
inextensible membrane deploying local active forces. The swimmer displays a
rich behavior: it may settle into a straight trajectory in the channel or
navigate from one wall to the other depending on its confinement. The nature of
the swimmer is also found to be affected by confinement: the swimmer can
behave, on the average over one swimming cycle, as a pusher at low confinement,
and becomes a puller at higher confinement. The swimmer's nature is thus not an
intrinsic property. The scaling of the swimmer velocity V with the force
amplitude A is analyzed in detail showing that at small enough A, $V\sim
A^2/\eta^2$, whereas at large enough A, V is independent of the force and is
determined solely by the stroke frequency and swimmer size. This finding
starkly contrasts with currently known results found from swimming models where
motion is based on flagellar or ciliary activity, where $V\sim A/\eta$. To
conclude, two definitions of efficiency as put forward in the literature are
analyzed with distinct outcomes. We find that one type of efficiency has an
optimum as a function of confinement while the other does not. Future
perspectives are outlined.

1604.06132	q-bio	q-bio.PE stat.ME	"Optimal timing of cross-sectional network samples in longitudinal
  network studies"	"  When choosing the timing of cross-sectional network snapshots in longitudinal
social network studies, the effect on the precision of parameter estimates
generally plays a minor role. Often the timing is opportunistic or determined
by a variety of considerations such as organizational constraints, funding, and
availability of study participants. Theory to guide the timing of network
snapshots is also missing. We use a statistical framework to relate the timing
to the precision of the parameter estimates, specifically, the sum of the
relative widths of their confidence intervals. We illustrate this
computationally using the STERGM suite of the statnet package to estimate the
parameters of the network dynamics. Analytically, we derive simple
approximations for the optimal timing when the parameters correspond to the
rates for different network events. We find that the optimal time depends the
most on the network processes with short expected durations and few expected
events such as the dissolution of ties. We apply our approximations to a simple
example of a dynamic network with formation and dissolution of iid ties.

1604.06300	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Current and Cretaceous-Cenozoic diversification of Angiosperms	"  Cretaceous-Cenozoic history of angiosperms led to the a certain character of
the distribution of taxa of different levels (the number of species and genera
in families, species/genera ratio in families, the number of species in the
genera). In most cases, these distributions are satisfactorily described by a
power law (Pareto distribution). In logarithmic coordinates power function is a
straight line. Empirical curves repeat this line is good enough, but on the
right side of the graph (at low volumes taxa), there is a marked deviation of
theoretical from the empirical curves. This suggests that the small volumes of
taxa should be greater for full compliance with the theoretical curves.
Modeling ratios among genera and species in families showed that only in the
case of dynamic extinction factor observed satisfactory agreement between
observed and calculated the number of species in a wide range of iterations.
This suggested that there was a differential extinction of species during the
evolution of angiosperms. This implies that the rate of extinction had to be
minimal in genera with a large number of species. On the contrary, extinction
rates may be increased by orders of magnitude with a decrease in the number of
species. As a result, large genera became getting bigger and small genera
become less. The species frequencies of distribution in the genera varied
according to a power law. The initial divergence of taxa volume, which led to
their further division into large and small, could be caused by the emergence
and expansion of herbs with their functional and adaptive capabilities.

  contradictory roles in the evolution of plant mating systems"	"  When predicting the fate and consequences of recurring deleterious mutations
in self-fertilising populations most models developed make the assumption that
populations have discrete non-overlapping generations. This makes them
biologically irrelevant when considering perennial species with over-lapping
generations and where mating occurs independently of the age group. Previous
models studying the effect of perennial life-histories on the genetic
properties of populations in the presence of self-fertilisation have done so
considering age-dependent selection and have found that, contrary to empirical
observations, perennial populations should exhibit lower levels of inbreeding
depression. Here we propose a simple deterministic model in continuous time
with selection at different fitness traits and feedback between population
fitness and size. We find that a perennial life-history can result in high
levels of inbreeding depression in spite of inbreeding, due to higher
frequencies of heterozygous individuals at the adult stage. We also propose
that there may be demographic advantages for self-fertilisation that are
independent of reproductive success.
"
1604.06438	q-bio	physics.soc-ph cs.SI q-bio.PE	Leaders should not be conformists in evolutionary social dilemmas	"  The most common assumption in evolutionary game theory is that players should
adopt a strategy that warrants the highest payoff. However, recent studies
indicate that the spatial selection for cooperation is enhanced if an
appropriate fraction of the population chooses the most common rather than the
most profitable strategy within the interaction range. Such conformity might be
due to herding instincts or crowd behavior in humans and social animals. In a
heterogeneous population where individuals differ in their degree, collective
influence, or other traits, an unanswered question remains who should conform.
Selecting conformists randomly is the simplest choice, but it is neither a
realistic nor the optimal one. We show that, regardless of the source of
heterogeneity and game parametrization, socially the most favorable outcomes
emerge if the masses conform. On the other hand, forcing leaders to conform
significantly hinders the constructive interplay between heterogeneity and
coordination, leading to evolutionary outcomes that are worse still than if
conformists were chosen randomly. We conclude that leaders must be able to
create a following for network reciprocity to be optimally augmented by
conformity. In the opposite case, when leaders are castrated and made to
follow, the failure of coordination impairs the evolution of cooperation.

1604.06486	q-bio	cs.CV q-bio.NC	"Humans and deep networks largely agree on which kinds of variation make
  object recognition harder"	"  View-invariant object recognition is a challenging problem, which has
attracted much attention among the psychology, neuroscience, and computer
vision communities. Humans are notoriously good at it, even if some variations
are presumably more difficult to handle than others (e.g. 3D rotations). Humans
are thought to solve the problem through hierarchical processing along the
ventral stream, which progressively extracts more and more invariant visual
features. This feed-forward architecture has inspired a new generation of
bio-inspired computer vision systems called deep convolutional neural networks
(DCNN), which are currently the best algorithms for object recognition in
natural images. Here, for the first time, we systematically compared human
feed-forward vision and DCNNs at view-invariant object recognition using the
same images and controlling for both the kinds of transformation as well as
their magnitude. We used four object categories and images were rendered from
3D computer models. In total, 89 human subjects participated in 10 experiments
in which they had to discriminate between two or four categories after rapid
presentation with backward masking. We also tested two recent DCNNs on the same
tasks. We found that humans and DCNNs largely agreed on the relative
difficulties of each kind of variation: rotation in depth is by far the hardest
transformation to handle, followed by scale, then rotation in plane, and
finally position. This suggests that humans recognize objects mainly through 2D
template matching, rather than by constructing 3D object models, and that DCNNs

show that the variation levels in rotation in depth and scale strongly modulate
both humans' and DCNNs' recognition performances. We thus argue that these
variations should be controlled in the image datasets used in vision research.

stationary solutions in simple models of the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis and
the stability of these solutions. It is proved that there are open sets of
parameters in a model of Zhu et. al. for which there exist two positive
stationary solutions. There are never more than two isolated positive
stationary solutions but under certain explicit special conditions on the
parameters there is a whole continuum of positive stationary solutions. It is
also shown that in the set of parameter values for which two isolated positive
stationary solutions exist there is an open subset where one of the solutions
is asymptotically stable and the other is unstable. In related models , for
which it was known that more that one positive stationary solution exists, it
is proved that there are parameter values for which one of these solutions is
asymptotically stable and the other unstable. A key technical aspect of the
proofs is to exploit the fact that there is a bifurcation where the centre
manifold is one-dimensional.

on reaction-diffusion systems, which are known to play an important role inside
living cells. Detailed microscopic simulations with off-lattice Brownian
dynamics become computationally expensive in crowded environments. In this
paper we therefore investigate to which extent on-lattice approximations, so
called Cellular Automata models, can be used to simulate reactions and
diffusion in the presence of crowding molecules. We show that the diffusion is
most severely slowed down in the off-lattice model, since randomly distributed
obstacles effectively exclude more volume than those ordered on an artificial
grid. Crowded reaction rates can be both increased and decreased by the grid
structure and it proves important to model the molecules with realistic sizes
when excluded volume is taken into account. The grid artifacts increase with
increasing crowder density and we conclude that the computationally more
efficient on-lattice simulations are accurate approximations only for low
crowder densities.

investigation of SCD in this area has been significantly limited mainly due to
the lack of research facilities and skilled personnel. Here, we present optical
measurements of individual red blood cells (RBCs) from healthy individuals and
individuals with SCD and sickle cell trait in Tanzania using the quantitative
phase imaging technique. By employing a quantitative phase imaging unit (QPIU),
an existing microscope in a clinic is transformed into a powerful quantitative
phase microscope providing measurements on the morphological, biochemical, and
biomechanical properties of individual cells. The present approach will open up
new opportunities for cost-effective investigation and diagnosis of several

N-terminal protein domain of the human transcription factor XPB. The results
are very significant as NTD-hXPB plays a critical role in the synthesis of
proteins (specifically transcription) and DNA damage repair (specifically
nucleotide excision repair). NTD-hXPB is directly implicated in rare diseases
XP-B, XP-CS, and TTD2, whose symptoms include neurodegenerative disorders,
premature aging, and decreased fertility. NTDhXPB is also linked to anti-cancer
therapies. As a bi-product we derived 3D models of NTD-mXPB - homologue of
NTD-hXPB in mycobacterium tuberculosis aka MTB (causative agent of most cases
of tuberculosis, which surpassed HIV as #1 infectious disease killer in 2014).
These could be potential target for TB therapeutics. Our ab-initio modelling
protocol takes advantage of recent powerful advances (prediction of contact
residues) in protein structure modeling. Our protocol also includes human in
the loop, inspired by the prevailing theory that computational abilities of
human minds can be powerfully harnessed in engineering/problem-solving. Using
the developed models in this paper, we are able to propose significant insights
into (a) the role of NTD-hXPB in the process of transcription and DNA damage
repair (specifically NER), (b) the critical interactions of NTD-hXPB with
another co-labourer protein p52, (c) diseases associated with NTD-hXPB, and (d)

  assessment"	"  Indirect reciprocity is one of the major mechanisms of the evolution of
cooperation. Because constant monitoring and accurate evaluation in moral
assessments tend to be costly, indirect reciprocity can be exploited by cost
evaders. A recent study crucially showed that a cooperative state achieved by
indirect reciprocators is easily destabilized by cost evaders in the case with
no supportive mechanism. Here, we present a simple and widely applicable
solution that considers pre-assessment of cost evaders. In the pre-assessment,
those who fail to pay for costly assessment systems are assigned a nasty image
that leads to being rejected by discriminators. We demonstrate that considering
the pre-assessment can crucially stabilize reciprocal cooperation for a broad
range of indirect reciprocity models. In particular for the most leading social
norms we analyse the conditions under which a prosocial state becomes locally
stable.

willing and capable partners must both be in the right place at the right time.
It has recently been demonstrated that many social organizations that support
sexual reproduction can evolve in the absence of social coordination between
agents (e.g. herding, assortative mating, and natal philopatry). In this paper
we explore these results by including social transfer mechanisms to our agents
and contrasting their reproductive behavior with a control group without social
transfer mechanisms. We conclude that similar behaviors emerge in our social
learning agents as those that emerged in the non-social learning agents. Social
learners were more inclined towards natal philopatry. Social learners also
evolved a culture of eusociality including reproductive division of labor.

We hypothesize that two conditions are necessary. First that genetic and
cultural information are stored separately in the agent. Second cultural
information must be transferred horizontally between agents of different
generations. We implement a model with these properties and show evidence of
divergent cultural evolution under both cooperative and competitive selection
pressures.

secondary structures from integrated local and global contextual features. Our
deep architecture leverages convolutional neural networks with different kernel
sizes to extract multiscale local contextual features. In addition, considering
long-range dependencies existing in amino acid sequences, we set up a
bidirectional neural network consisting of gated recurrent unit to capture
global contextual features. Furthermore, multi-task learning is utilized to
predict secondary structure labels and amino-acid solvent accessibility
simultaneously. Our proposed deep network demonstrates its effectiveness by
achieving state-of-the-art performance, i.e., 69.7% Q8 accuracy on the public
benchmark CB513, 76.9% Q8 accuracy on CASP10 and 73.1% Q8 accuracy on CASP11.

comparison of DW-MRI models is critically missing in the field. To address this
deficiency, we organized the ""White Matter Modeling Challenge"" during the
International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2015 conference. This
competition aimed at identifying the DW-MRI models that best predict unseen DW
data. in vivo DW-MRI data was acquired on the Connectom scanner at the
A.A.Martinos Center (Massachusetts General Hospital) using gradients strength
of up to 300 mT/m and a broad set of diffusion times. We focused on assessing
the DW signal prediction in two regions: the genu in the corpus callosum, where
the fibres are relatively straight and parallel, and the fornix, where the
configuration of fibres is more complex. The challenge participants had access
to three-quarters of the whole dataset, and their models were ranked on their
ability to predict the remaining unseen quarter of data. In this paper we
provide both an overview and a more in-depth description of each evaluated
model, report the challenge results, and infer trends about the model
characteristics that were associated with high model ranking. This work
provides a much needed benchmark for DW-MRI models. The acquired data and model
details for signal prediction evaluation are provided online to encourage a

  prioritize cancer candidate genes"	"  One of the notable fields in studying the genetics of cancer is disease gene
identification which affects disease treatment and drug discovery. Many
researches have been done in this field. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
are one of them that focus on the identification of diseases-susceptible loci
on chromosomes. Recently, computational approaches, known as gene
prioritization methods have been used to identify candidate disease genes. Gene
prioritization methods integrate several data sources to discover and
prioritize the most probable candidate disease genes. In this paper, we propose
a prioritization method, called HybridRanker which is a network-based technique
and it also uses experimental data to identify candidate cancer genes. We apply
our proposed method on colorectal cancer data. It is notable to say that in
HybridRanker, for considering both local and global network information of a
protein-protein interaction network, different algorithms such as
shortest-path, random walk with restart and network propagation are exploited.
By using these algorithms, initial scores are given to genes within the
network. Furthermore, by looking through diseases with similar symptoms and
also comorbid diseases and by extracting their causing genes, the gene scores
are recalculated. We also use gene-phenotype relations for an additional
scoring of the candidate genes. Our method is validated and compared with other
prioritization methods in leave one-out cross-validation and the comparison
results show the better performance of the HybridRanker.

  Information to Prioritize Disease Candidate Genes"	"  The identification of disease-associated genes has recently gathered much
attention for uncovering disease complex mechanisms that could lead to new
insights into the treatment of diseases. For exploring disease-susceptible
genes, not only experimental approaches such as genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) have been used, but also computational methods. Since experimental
approaches are both time-consuming and expensive, numerous studies have
utilized computational techniques to explore disease genes. These methods use
various biological data sources and known disease genes to prioritize disease
candidate genes. In this paper, we propose a gene prioritization method
(NRSSPrioritize), which benefits from both local and global measures of a
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and also from disease similarity
knowledge to suggest candidate genes for colorectal cancer (CRC)
susceptibility. Network Propagation, Random Walk with Restart, and Shortest
Paths are three network analysis tools that are applied to a PPI network for
the purpose of scoring candidate genes. Also, by looking through diseases with
similar symptoms to CRC and obtaining their causing genes, candidate genes are
scored in a different way. Finally, to integrate these four different scoring
schemes, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution
(TOPSIS) and Analytic Network Process (ANP) methods are applied to obtain
appropriate weights for the above four quantified measures and the weighted
summation of these measures are used to calculate the final score of each
candidate gene. NRSSPrioritize was validated by cross-validation analysis and
its results were compared with other prioritization tools, which gave the best
performance when using our proposed method.

  Object, and Face Recognition"	"  It is commonly believed that the central visual field is important for
recognizing objects and faces, and the peripheral region is useful for scene
recognition. However, the relative importance of central versus peripheral
information for object, scene, and face recognition is unclear. In a behavioral
study, Larson and Loschky (2009) investigated this question by measuring the
scene recognition accuracy as a function of visual angle, and demonstrated that
peripheral vision was indeed more useful in recognizing scenes than central
vision. In this work, we modeled and replicated the result of Larson and
Loschky (2009), using deep convolutional neural networks. Having fit the data
for scenes, we used the model to predict future data for large-scale scene
recognition as well as for objects and faces. Our results suggest that the
relative order of importance of using central visual field information is face
recognition>object recognition>scene recognition, and vice-versa for peripheral
information.

  and discrimination"	"  Highly connected recurrent neural networks often produce chaotic dynamics,
meaning their precise activity is sensitive to small perturbations. What are
the consequences for how such networks encode streams of temporal stimuli? On
the one hand, chaos is a strong source of randomness, suggesting that small
changes in stimuli will be obscured by intrinsically generated variability. On
the other hand, recent work shows that the type of chaos that occurs in spiking
networks can have a surprisingly low-dimensional structure, suggesting that
there may be ""room"" for fine stimulus features to be precisely resolved. Here
we show that strongly chaotic networks produce patterned spikes that reliably
encode time-dependent stimuli: using a decoder sensitive to spike times on
timescales of 10's of ms, one can easily distinguish responses to very similar
inputs. Moreover, recurrence serves to distribute signals throughout chaotic
networks so that small groups of cells can encode substantial information about
signals arriving elsewhere. A conclusion is that the presence of strong chaos
in recurrent networks does not prohibit precise stimulus encoding.

rigorous ETs for Molecular Dynamics (MD). Based on this fact, we use Real Space
RG to vary the resolution of a MSM and define an algorithm for clustering
microstates into macrostates. The result is a lower dimensional stochastic
model which, by construction, provides the optimal coarse-grained Markovian
representation of the system's relaxation kinetics. To illustrate and validate
our theory, we analyze a number of test systems of increasing complexity,
ranging from synthetic toy models to two realistic applications, built form
all-atom MD simulations. The computational cost of computing the
low-dimensional model remains affordable on a desktop computer even for

solely with the property of excitability, since disorder emerges by the
formation of chaotic patterns in excitable media. To shed light on the data, we
discuss the hypothesis that, in fact, fibrillation appears through a phase

random pinning might occur due to random modulation of the gap junction

hydrodynamically confined nanoliter volumes of reagents to interact with the
substrate at the micrometer-length scale. We study the interplay between
diffusion, advection, and surface chemistry and present the design of a
noncontact scanning microfluidic device to efficiently present reagents on
surfaces. By leveraging convective flows, recirculation, and mixing of a
processing liquid, this device overcomes limitations of existing biopatterning
approaches, such as passive diffusion of analytes, uncontrolled wetting, and
drying artifacts. We demonstrate the deposition of analytes, showing a 2- to
5-fold increase in deposition rate together with a 10-fold reduction in analyte
consumption while ensuring less than 6% variation in pattern homogeneity on a
standard biological substrate. In addition, we demonstrate the recirculation of
a processing liquid using a microfluidic probe (MFP) in the context of a
surface assay for (i) probing 12 independent areas with a single microliter of
processing liquid and (ii) processing a 2 mm2 surface to create 170 antibody
spots of 50 x 100 {\mu}m2 area using 1.6 {\mu}L of liquid. We observe high
pattern quality, conservative usage of reagents, micrometer precision of

  Modeling Exploration"	"  Are face and object recognition abilities independent? Although it is
commonly believed that they are, Gauthier et al.(2014) recently showed that
these abilities become more correlated as experience with nonface categories
increases. They argued that there is a single underlying visual ability, v,
that is expressed in performance with both face and nonface categories as
experience grows. Using the Cambridge Face Memory Test and the Vanderbilt
Expertise Test, they showed that the shared variance between Cambridge Face
Memory Test and Vanderbilt Expertise Test performance increases monotonically
as experience increases. Here, we address why a shared resource across
different visual domains does not lead to competition and to an inverse
correlation in abilities? We explain this conundrum using our
neurocomputational model of face and object processing (The Model, TM). Our
results show that, as in the behavioral data, the correlation between
subordinate level face and object recognition accuracy increases as experience
grows. We suggest that different domains do not compete for resources because
the relevant features are shared between faces and objects. The essential power
of experience is to generate a ""spreading transform"" for faces that generalizes
to objects that must be individuated. Interestingly, when the task of the
network is basic level categorization, no increase in the correlation between
domains is observed. Hence, our model predicts that it is the type of
experience that matters and that the source of the correlation is in the
fusiform face area, rather than in cortical areas that subserve basic level
categorization. This result is consistent with our previous modeling
elucidating why the FFA is recruited for novel domains of expertise (Tong et
al., 2008).

Chaetopterus marine worm and determine the intrinsic lengthscales controlling
distinct rheological and structural regimes. Mucus produced by this ubiquitous
filter feeder serves a host of roles including filtration, protection and
trapping nutrients. The ease of clean mucus extraction coupled with
similarities to human mucus rheology also make Chaetopterus mucus a potential
model system for elucidating human mucus mechanics. We use optically trapped
microsphere probes of 2-10 microns, to induce oscillatory strains and measure
mucus stress response. We show that viscoelastic properties are highly
dependent on the strain scale (l) with three distinct regimes emerging:
microscale: l_1<4 microns, mesoscale: l_2~4-10 microns, and macroscale: l_3>10
microns. While mucus response is similar to water for l_1 indicating that
probes rarely contact the mucus mesh, for l_2 the response is distinctly more
viscous and independent of probe size, demonstrating that the mucus behaves as
a continuum. However, this principally viscous mesoscale response is distinct
from the largely elastic macroscopic mucus response. Only for l_3 does the
response mimic macroscopic elasticity, with rigid constraints strongly
resisting microsphere displacement. Our results demonstrate that a uniform mesh
model for mucus with a single lengthscale modulating the crossover from
water-like to elastic is too simplistic. Rather, the mucus responds as a
hierarchical network with a loose microscopic mesh controlling mechanics for
l_2, coupled with a mesoscale rigid scaffold responsible for the macroscopic
gel-like mechanics beyond l_3. Our results shed important new light onto the
design of drug delivery platforms, preventing pathogen penetration, and
improving filtration, coating and clearance capabilities of mucus.

the analogue of Poincar\'e criterion, theory of differential inequalities,

in the context of the statistical mechanics theory of non covalent bonding in
drug receptor systems. I show that most of the pitfalls and entanglements for
the binding free energies evaluation in computer simulations are rooted in the
equilibrium assumption that is implicit in the reversible method. These
critical issues can be resolved by using a non-equilibrium variant of the
alchemical method in molecular dynamics simulations, relying on the production
of many independent trajectories with a continuous dynamical evolution of an
externally driven alchemical coordinate, completing the decoupling of the
ligand in a matter of few tens of picoseconds rather than nanoseconds. The
absolute binding free energy can be recovered from the annihilation work
distributions by applying an unbiased unidirectional free energy estimate, on
the assumption that any observed work distribution is given by a mixture of
normal distributions, whose components are identical in either direction of the
non-equilibrium process, with weights regulated by the Crooks theorem. I
finally show that the inherent reliability and accuracy of the unidirectional
estimate of the decoupling free energies, based on the production of few
hundreds of non-equilibrium independent sub-nanoseconds unrestrained alchemical
annihilation processes, is a direct consequence of the funnel-like shape of the
free energy surface in molecular recognition. An application of the technique
on a real drug-receptor system is presented in the companion paper.

division is associated with disorganized mitotic chromosome movements and
chromosome loss. Despite recent work studying effects of kinesin 8s on
microtubule dynamics, it remains unclear whether the kinesin-8 mitotic
phenotypes are consequences of their effect on microtubule dynamics, their
well-established motor activity, or additional unknown functions. To better
understand the role of kinesin-8 proteins in mitosis, we have studied the
effects of deletion of the fission-yeast kinesin-8 proteins Klp5 and Klp6 on
chromosome movements and spindle length dynamics. Aberrant microtubule-driven
kinetochore pushing movements and tripolar mitotic spindles occurred in cells
lacking Klp5 but not Klp6. Kinesin-8 deletion strains showed large fluctuations
in metaphase spindle length, suggesting a disruption of spindle length
stabilization. Comparison of our results from light microscopy with a
mathematical model suggests that kinesin-8 induced effects on microtubule
dynamics, kinetochore attachment stability, and sliding force in the spindle

seen.

  under Tension"	"  Because of the potential link between -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting
and response of a pseudoknot (PK) RNA to force, a number of single molecule
pulling experiments have been performed on PKs to decipher the mechanism of
programmed ribosomal frameshifting. Motivated in part by these experiments, we
performed simulations using a coarse-grained model of RNA to describe the
response of a PK over a range of mechanical forces ($f$s) and monovalent salt
concentrations ($C$s). The coarse-grained simulations quantitatively reproduce
the multistep thermal melting observed in experiments, thus validating our
model. The free energy changes obtained in simulations are in excellent
agreement with experiments. By varying $f$ and $C$, we calculated the phase
diagram that shows a sequence of structural transitions, populating distinct
intermediate states. As $f$ and $C$ are changed, the stem-loop tertiary
interactions rupture first, followed by unfolding of the $3^{\prime}$-end
hairpin ($\textrm{I}\rightleftharpoons\textrm{F}$). Finally, the
$5^{\prime}$-end hairpin unravels, producing an extended state
($\textrm{E}\rightleftharpoons\textrm{I}$). A theoretical analysis of the phase
boundaries shows that the critical force for rupture scales as $\left(\log
C_{\textrm{m}}\right)^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha=1\,(0.5)$ for
$\textrm{E}\rightleftharpoons\textrm{I}$
($\textrm{I}\rightleftharpoons\textrm{F}$) transition. This relation is used to
obtain the preferential ion-RNA interaction coefficient, which can be
quantitatively measured in single-molecule experiments, as done previously for
DNA hairpins. A by-product of our work is the suggestion that the frameshift
efficiency is likely determined by the stability of the $5^{\prime}$-end
hairpin that the ribosome first encounters during translation.

1604.08314	q-bio	q-bio.QM	A hybrid algorithm for coupling PDE and compartment-based dynamics	"  Stochastic simulation methods can be applied successfully to model exact
spatio-temporally resolved reaction-diffusion systems. However, in many cases,
these methods can quickly become extremely computationally intensive with
increasing particle numbers. An alternative description of many of these
systems can be derived in the diffusive limit as a deterministic, continuum
system of partial differential equations. Although the numerical solution of
such partial differential equations is, in general, much more efficient than
the full stochastic simulation, the deterministic continuum description is
generally not valid when copy numbers are low and stochastic effects dominate.
Therefore, to take advantage of the benefits of both of these types of models,
each of which may be appropriate in different parts of a spatial domain, we
have developed an algorithm that can be used to couple these two types of model
together. This hybrid coupling algorithm uses an overlap region between the two
modelling regimes. By coupling fluxes at one end of the interface and using a
concentration-matching condition at the other end, we ensure that mass is
appropriately transferred between PDE- and compartment-based regimes. Our
methodology gives notable reductions in simulation time in comparison with
using a fully stochastic model, whilst maintaining the important stochastic
features of the system and providing detail in appropriate areas of the domain.
We test our hybrid methodology robustly by applying it to several biologically
motivated problems including diffusion and morphogen gradient formation. Our
analysis shows that the resulting error is small, unbiased and does not grow
over time.

1604.08354	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio.BM	Inferring interaction partners from protein sequences	"  Specific protein-protein interactions are crucial in the cell, both to ensure
the formation and stability of multi-protein complexes, and to enable signal
transduction in various pathways. Functional interactions between proteins
result in coevolution between the interaction partners, causing their sequences
to be correlated. Here we exploit these correlations to accurately identify
which proteins are specific interaction partners from sequence data alone. Our
general approach, which employs a pairwise maximum entropy model to infer
couplings between residues, has been successfully used to predict the
three-dimensional structures of proteins from sequences. Thus inspired, we
introduce an iterative algorithm to predict specific interaction partners from
two protein families whose members are known to interact. We first assess the
algorithm's performance on histidine kinases and response regulators from
bacterial two-component signaling systems. We obtain a striking 0.93 true
positive fraction on our complete dataset without any a priori knowledge of
interaction partners, and we uncover the origin of this success. We then apply
the algorithm to proteins from ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter
complexes, and obtain accurate predictions in these systems as well. Finally,
we present two metrics that accurately distinguish interacting protein families
from non-interacting ones, using only sequence data.

1604.08426	q-bio	cs.CV q-bio.NC	"A Novel Method to Study Bottom-up Visual Saliency and its Neural
  Mechanism"	"  In this study, we propose a novel method to measure bottom-up saliency maps
of natural images. In order to eliminate the influence of top-down signals,
backward masking is used to make stimuli (natural images) subjectively
invisible to subjects, however, the bottom-up saliency can still orient the
subjects attention. To measure this orientation/attention effect, we adopt the
cueing effect paradigm by deploying discrimination tasks at each location of an
image, and measure the discrimination performance variation across the image as
the attentional effect of the bottom-up saliency. Such attentional effects are
combined to construct a final bottomup saliency map. Based on the proposed
method, we introduce a new bottom-up saliency map dataset of natural images to
benchmark computational models. We compare several state-of-the-art saliency
models on the dataset. Moreover, the proposed paradigm is applied to
investigate the neural basis of the bottom-up visual saliency map by analyzing
psychophysical and fMRI experimental results. Our findings suggest that the
bottom-up saliency maps of natural images are constructed in V1. It provides a
strong scientific evidence to resolve the long standing dispute in neuroscience
about where the bottom-up saliency map is constructed in human brain.

  partial epilepsy"	"  Neural network oscillations are a fundamental mechanism for cognition,
perception and consciousness. Consequently, perturbations of network activity
play an important role in the pathophysiology of brain disorders. When
structural information from non-invasive brain imaging is merged with
mathematical modeling, then generative brain network models constitute
in-silico platforms for the exploration of causal mechanisms of brain function
and clinical hypothesis testing. We here demonstrate along the example of
drug-resistant epilepsy that patient-specific virtual brain models derived from
diffusion MRI have sufficient predictive power to improve diagnosis and surgery
outcome. In partial epilepsy, seizures originate in a local network, the
so-called epileptogenic zone, before recruiting other close or distant brain
regions. We create personalized large-scale brain networks for 15 patients and
simulate the individual seizure propagation patterns. Model validation is
performed against the presurgical stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG)
data and the standard-of-care clinical evaluation. We demonstrate that the
individual brain models account for the temporal variability in patient seizure
propagation patterns and explain the variability in postsurgical success. Our
results show that individual variations in structural connectivity, when linked
with mathematical dynamic models, have the capacity to explain changes in
spatiotemporal organization of brain dynamics as observed in network-based
brain disorders, thus opening up avenues towards discovery of novel clinical
interventions.

  clathrin-mediated endocytosis"	"  In clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), clathrin and various adaptor proteins
coat a patch of the plasma membrane, which is reshaped to form a budded
vesicle. Experimental studies have demonstrated that elevated membrane tension
can inhibit bud formation by a clathrin coat. In this study, we investigate the
impact of membrane tension on the mechanics of membrane budding by simulating
clathrin coats that either grow in area or progressively induce greater
curvature. At low membrane tension, progressively increasing the area of a
curvature-generating coat causes the membrane to smoothly evolve from a flat to
budded morphology, whereas the membrane remains essentially flat at high
membrane tensions. Interestingly, at physiologically relevant, intermediate
membrane tensions, the shape evolution of the membrane undergoes a snapthrough
instability in which increasing coat area causes the membrane to ""snap"" from an
open, U-shaped bud to a closed, $\Omega$-shaped bud. This instability is
accompanied by a large energy barrier, which could cause a developing endocytic
pit to stall if the binding energy of additional coat is insufficient to
overcome this barrier. Similar results were found for a coat of constant area
in which the spontaneous curvature progressively increases. Additionally, a
pulling force on the bud, simulating a force from actin polymerization, is
sufficient to drive a transition from an open to closed bud, overcoming the
energy barrier opposing this transition.

  spines"	"  Transient spine enlargement (3-5 min timescale) is an important event
associated with the structural plasticity of dendritic spines. Many of the
molecular mechanisms associated with transient spine enlargement have been
identified experimentally. Here, we use a systems biology approach to construct
a mathematical model of biochemical signaling and actin-mediated transient
spine expansion in response to calcium-influx due to NMDA receptor activation.
We have identified that a key feature of this signaling network is the
paradoxical signaling loop. Paradoxical components act bifunctionally in
signaling networks and their role is to control both the activation and
inhibition of a desired response function (protein activity or spine volume).
Using ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based modeling, we show that the
dynamics of different regulators of transient spine expansion including CaMKII,
RhoA, and Cdc42 and the spine volume can be described using paradoxical
signaling loops. Our model is able to capture the experimentally observed
dynamics of transient spine volume. Furthermore, we show that actin remodeling
events provide a robustness to spine volume dynamics. We also generate
experimentally testable predictions about the role of different components and
parameters of the network on spine dynamics.

1604.08696	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Gompertzian population growth under some deterministic and stochastic
  jump schedules"	"  Many cell populations, exemplified by certain tumors, grow approximately
according to a Gompertzian growth model which has a slower approach to an upper
limit than that of logistic growth. Certain populations of animals and other
organisms have also recently been analyzed with the Gompertz model. This
article addresses the question of how long it takes to reduce the population
from one level to a lower one under a schedule of sudden decrements, each of
which removes a given fraction of the cell mass or population. A deterministic
periodic schedule is first examined and yields exact results for the
eradication or extinction time which is defined as that required to reduce the
number of cells to less than unity. The decrements in cell mass at each hit
could correspond to an approximation to reduction of a tumor by external beam
radiation therapy. The effects of variations in magnitude of successive
decrements, the time interval between them, the initial population size and the
intrinsic growth rate are calculated and results presented graphically.
  With a schedule governed by a Poisson process, the number of organisms or
cells satisfies a stochastic differential equation whose solution sample paths
have downward jumps as random times. The moments of the exit time then satisfy
a system of recurrent differential-difference equations. A simple
transformation results in a simpler system which has been studied both
analytically and numerically in the context of interspike intervals of a model
neuron. Results are presented for the mean eradication time for various
frequencies and magnitudes of hits and for various eventual and initial
population sizes. The standard deviation of the eradication time is also
investigated.

1604.08890	q-bio	q-bio.BM	How did prebiotic polymers become informational foldamers?	"  A mystery about the origins of life is which molecular structures $-$ and
what spontaneous processes $-$ drove the autocatalytic transition from simple
chemistry to biology? Using the HP lattice model of polymer sequence spaces
leads to the prediction that random sequences of hydrophobic ($H$) and polar
($P$) monomers can collapse into relatively compact structures, exposing
hydrophobic surfaces, acting as primitive versions of today's protein
catalysts, elongating other such HP polymers, as ribosomes would now do. Such
foldamer-catalysts form an autocatalytic set, growing short chains into longer
chains that have particular sequences. The system has capacity for the
multimodality: ability to settle at multiple distinct quasi-stable states
characterized by different groups of dominating polymers. This is a testable
mechanism that we believe is relevant to the early origins of life.

1604.08912	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Classifying HCP Task-fMRI Networks Using Heat Kernels	"  Network theory provides a principled abstraction of the human brain: reducing
a complex system into a simpler representation from which to investigate brain
organisation. Recent advancement in the neuroimaging field are towards
representing brain connectivity as a dynamic process in order to gain a deeper
understanding of the interplay between functional modules for efficient
information transport. In this work, we employ heat kernels to model the
process of energy diffusion in functional networks. We extract node-based,
multi-scale features which describe the propagation of heat over 'time' which
not only inform the importance of a node in the graph, but also incorporate
local and global information of the underlying geometry of the network. As a
proof-of-concept, we test the efficacy of two heat kernel features for
discriminating between motor and working memory functional networks from the
Human Connectome Project. For comparison, we also classified task networks
using traditional network metrics which similarly provide rankings of node
importance. In addition, a variant of the Smooth Incremental Graphical Lasso
Estimation algorithm was used to estimate non-sparse, precision matrices to
account for non-stationarity in the time series. We illustrate differences in
heat kernel features between tasks, and also between regions of the brain.
Using a random forest classifier, we showed heat kernel metrics to capture
intrinsic properties of functional networks that serve well as features for
task classification.

1604.08916	q-bio	q-bio.CB	Inferring models of bacterial dynamics toward point sources	"  Experiments have shown that bacteria can be sensitive to small variations in
chemoattractant (CA) concentrations. Motivated by these findings, our focus
here is on a regime rarely studied in experiments: bacteria tracking point CA
sources (such as food patches or even prey). In tracking point sources, the CA
detected by bacteria may show very large spatiotemporal fluctuations which vary
with distance from the source. We present a general statistical model to
describe how bacteria locate point sources of food on the basis of stochastic
event detection, rather than CA gradient information. We show how all model
parameters can be directly inferred from single cell tracking data even in the
limit of high detection noise. Once parameterized, our model recapitulates
bacterial behavior around point sources such as the ""volcano effect"". In
addition, while the search by bacteria for point sources such as prey may
appear random, our model identifies key statistical signatures of a targeted
search for a point source given any arbitrary source configuration.

1604.08921	q-bio	q-bio.PE math.DS q-bio.TO	"An ecological resilience perspective on cancer: insights from a toy
  model"	"  In this paper we propose an ecological resilience point of view on cancer.
This view is based on the analysis of a simple ODE model for the interactions
between cancer and normal cells. The model presents two regimes for tumor
growth. In the first, cancer arises due to three reasons: a partial corruption
of the functions that avoid the growth of mutated cells, an aggressive
phenotype of tumor cells and exposure to external carcinogenic factors. In this
case, treatments may be effective if they drive the system to the basin of
attraction of the cancer cure state. In the second regime, cancer arises
because the repair system is intrinsically corrupted. In this case, the
complete cure is not possible since the cancer cure state is no more stable,
but tumor recurrence may be delayed if treatment is prolongued. We review three
indicators of the resilience of a stable equilibrium, related with size and
shape of its basin of attraction: latitude, precariousness and resistance. A
novel method to calculate these indicators is proposed. This method is simpler
and more efficient than those currently used, and may be easily applied to
other population dynamics models. We apply this method to the model and
investigate how these indicators behave with parameters changes. Finally, we
present some simulations to illustrate how the resilience analysis can be
applied to validated models in order to obtain indicators for personalized
cancer treatments.

1605.00017	q-bio	cs.LG q-bio.QM	deepMiRGene: Deep Neural Network based Precursor microRNA Prediction	"  Since microRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in post-transcriptional gene
regulation, miRNA identification is one of the most essential problems in
computational biology. miRNAs are usually short in length ranging between 20
and 23 base pairs. It is thus often difficult to distinguish miRNA-encoding
sequences from other non-coding RNAs and pseudo miRNAs that have a similar
length, and most previous studies have recommended using precursor miRNAs
instead of mature miRNAs for robust detection. A great number of conventional
machine-learning-based classification methods have been proposed, but they
often have the serious disadvantage of requiring manual feature engineering,
and their performance is limited as well. In this paper, we propose a novel
miRNA precursor prediction algorithm, deepMiRGene, based on recurrent neural
networks, specifically long short-term memory networks. deepMiRGene
automatically learns suitable features from the data themselves without manual
feature engineering and constructs a model that can successfully reflect
structural characteristics of precursor miRNAs. For the performance evaluation
of our approach, we have employed several widely used evaluation metrics on
three recent benchmark datasets and verified that deepMiRGene delivered
comparable performance among the current state-of-the-art tools.

1605.00033	q-bio	q-bio.OT	A framework for philosophical biology	"  Advances in biology have mostly relied on theories that were subsequently
revised, expanded or eventually refuted using experimental and other means.
Theoretical biology used to primarily provide a basis to rationally examine the
frameworks within which biological experiments were carried out and to shed
light on overlooked gaps in understanding. Today, however, theoretical biology
has generally become synonymous with computational and mathematical biology.
This could in part be explained by a relatively recent tendency in which a
""data first"", rather than a ""theory first"", approach is preferred. Moreover,
generating hypotheses has at times become procedural rather than theoretical.
This situation leaves our understanding enmeshed in data, which should be
disentangled from much noise. Given the many unresolved questions in biology
and medicine, it seems apt to revive the role of pure theory in the biological
sciences. This paper makes the case for a ""philosophical biology""
(philbiology), distinct from but quite complementary to philosophy of biology
(philobiology), which would entail biological investigation through
philosophical approaches. Philbiology would thus be a reincarnation of
theoretical biology, adopting the true sense of the word ""theory"" and making
use of a rich tradition of serious philosophical approaches in the natural
sciences. A philbiological investigation, after clearly defining a given
biological problem, would aim to propose a set of empirical questions, along
with a class of possible solutions, about that problem. Importantly, whether or
not the questions can be tested using current experimental paradigms would be
secondary to whether the questions are inherently empirical or not. The final
goal of a philbiological investigation would be to develop a theoretical
framework that can lead observational and/or interventional experimental
studies of the defined problem.

provide data that suggested that in a null context,
antecedent-contained-deletion (ACD) relative clause structures modifying a
quantified object noun phrase are easier to process than those modifying a
definite object NP. HKV argue that this pattern of results supports a
quantifier-raising (QR) analysis of both ACD structures and quantified NPs in
object position: under the account that they advocate, both ACD resolution and
quantified NPs in object position require movement of the object NP to a higher
syntactic position. The processing advantage for quantified object NPs in ACD
is hypothesized to derive from the fact that - at the point where ACD
resolution must take place - the quantified NP has already undergone QR whereas
this is not the case for definite NPs. Here, we report attempted replications
of their self-paced reading Experiments 1 and 2. We do not replicate the
critical interactions in any of the words immediately following the
disambiguating verb in either experiment. Putting these observations together
with the observation that it was only post-hoc analysis decisions that were
responsible for HKV's observed effects in the first place (Gibson et al.,
submitted), we conclude that the experiments reported by HKV should not be
viewed as providing evidence for the ACD quantifier raising processing effect.

brain function. This research has been pioneered by NeuroSynth, a database
collecting both brain activation coordinates and associated text across a large
cohort of neuroimaging research papers. One of the fundamental aspects of such
meta-analysis is text-mining. To date, word counts and more sophisticated
methods such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation have been proposed. In this work we
present an unsupervised study of the NeuroSynth text corpus using Deep
Boltzmann Machines (DBMs). The use of DBMs yields several advantages over the
aforementioned methods, principal among which is the fact that it yields both
word and document embeddings in a high-dimensional vector space. Such
embeddings serve to facilitate the use of traditional machine learning
techniques on the text corpus. The proposed DBM model is shown to learn
embeddings with a clear semantic structure.

passive inclusions in biomembranes. Here, a detailed analytical and numerical

widely used for modelling and analysing biological systems. PBNs are suited for
modelling large biological systems, which more and more often arise in systems
biology. However, the large system size poses a~significant challenge to the
analysis of PBNs, in particular, to the crucial analysis of their steady-state
behaviour. Numerical methods for performing steady-state analyses suffer from
the state-space explosion problem, which makes the utilisation of statistical
methods the only viable approach. However, such methods require long
simulations of PBNs, rendering the simulation speed a crucial efficiency
factor. For large PBNs and high estimation precision requirements, a slow
simulation speed becomes an obstacle. In this paper, we propose a
structure-based method for fast simulation of PBNs. This method first performs
a network reduction operation and then divides nodes into groups for parallel
simulation. Experimental results show that our method can lead to an
approximately 10 times speedup for computing steady-state probabilities of a

from a fundamental polymer-physics perspective and due to the importance of
circular DNA molecules in vivo. We here observe the unfolding of DNA from the
circular to linear configuration as a light-induced double strand break occurs,
characterize the dynamics, and compare the equilibrium conformational
statistics of linear and circular configurations. This is important because it
allows us to determine to which extent existing statistical theories describe
the extension of confined circular DNA. We find that the ratio of the
extensions of confined linear and circular DNA configurations increases as the
buffer concentration decreases. The experimental results fall between
theoretical predictions for the extended de Gennes regime at weaker confinement
and the Odijk regime at stronger confinement. We show that it is possible to
directly distinguish between circular and linear DNA molecules by measuring the
emission intensity from the DNA. Finally, we determine the rate of unfolding
and show that this rate is larger for more confined DNA, possibly reflecting
the corresponding larger difference in entropy between the circular and linear
configurations.

epidemic spreading dynamics influenced by spatial structure and human dynamics
(including both human mobility and human interaction intensity). We propose a
systematical model to depict nationwide epidemic spreading in C\^{o}te
d'Ivoire, which integrates multiple factors, such as human mobility, human
interaction intensity, and demographic features. We provide insights to aid in
modeling and predicting the epidemic spreading process by data-driven
simulation and theoretical analysis, which is otherwise beyond the scope of
local evaluation and geometrical views. We show that the requirement that the
average local basic reproductive number to be greater than unity is not
necessary for outbreaks of epidemics. The observed spreading phenomenon can be
roughly explained as a heterogeneous diffusion-reaction process by redefining
mobility distance according to the human mobility volume between nodes, which
is beyond the geometrical viewpoint. However, the heterogeneity of human
dynamics still poses challenges to precise prediction.

networks, static networks and a fully connected topology. We notice that the
difference between the static and fully-connected networks -- with respect to
time to extinction and average outbreak size -- is smaller than between the
temporal and static topologies. This suggests that, for these data sets,
temporal structures influence disease spreading more than static network
structures. To explain the details in the differences between the

interactions between individuals. However, even if they could provide an
explanation for the emergence and stability of cooperation in modern societies,
they are not able to reproduce some key features observed in social and
economical interactions. The typical shape of wealth distribution - known as
Pareto Law - and the microscopic organization of wealth production are two of
them. Here, we introduce a modification to the classical formulation of Public
Goods Games that allows for the emergence of both of these features from first
principles. Unlike traditional Public Goods Games on networks, where players
contribute equally to all the games in which they participate, we allow
individuals to redistribute their contribution according to what they earned in
previous rounds. Results from numerical simulations show that not only a Pareto
distribution for the payoffs naturally emerges but also that if players don't
invest enough in one round they can act as defectors even if they are formally
cooperators. Finally, we also show that the players self-organize in a very
productive backbone that covers almost perfectly the minimum spanning tree of
the underlying interaction network. Our results not only give an explanation
for the presence of the wealth heterogeneity observed in real data but also
points to a conceptual change regarding how cooperation is defined in

models, which make judgments based on analogies to stored experiences of
previously encountered scenes and physical outcomes. Versions of the latter
have recently been instantiated in convolutional neural network (CNN)
architectures. Here we report four experiments that, to our knowledge, are the
first rigorous comparisons of simulation-based and CNN-based models, where both
approaches are concretely instantiated in algorithms that can run on raw image
inputs and produce as outputs physical judgments such as whether a stack of
blocks will fall. Both approaches can achieve super-human accuracy levels and
can quantitatively predict human judgments to a similar degree, but only the
simulation-based models generalize to novel situations in ways that people do,
and are qualitatively consistent with systematic perceptual illusions and
judgment asymmetries that people show.

index amongst a set of trial states and use these target states as milestones
(or core sets) to build Markov State Models (MSMs). If the optimized
metastability index is small, this automatically guarantees the accuracy of the
MSM, in the sense that the transitions between the target milestones is indeed
approximately Markovian. The method is simple to implement and use, it does not
require that the dynamics on the trial milestones be Markovian, and it also
offers the possibility to partition the system's state-space by assigning every
trial milestone to the target milestones it is most likely to visit next and to
identify transition state regions. Here the method is tested on the Gly-Ala-Gly
peptide, where it shown to correctly identify the expected metastable states in
the dihedral angle space of the molecule without \textit{a~priori} information
about these states. It is also applied to analyze the folding landscape of the
Beta3s mini-protein, where it is shown to identify the folded basin as a
connecting hub between an helix-rich region, which is entropically stabilized,
and a beta-rich region, which is energetically stabilized and acts as a kinetic
trap.

  interaction"	"  To better understand protein-solvent interaction we have analyzed a variety
of physical and geometrical properties of the solvent-excluded surfaces (SESs)
over a large set of soluble proteins with crystal structures. We discover that
all have net negative surface charges and permanent electric dipoles. Moreover
both SES area and surface charge as well as several physical and geometrical
properties defined by them change with protein size via well-fitted power laws.
The relevance to protein-solvent interaction of these physical and geometrical
properties is supported by strong correlations between them and known
hydrophobicity scales and by their large changes upon protein unfolding. The
universal existence of negative surface charge and dipole, the characteristic
surface geometry and power laws reveal fundamental but distinct roles of
surface charge and SES in protein-solvent interaction and make it possible to
describe solvation and hydrophobic effect using theories on anion solute in
protic solvent. In particular the great significance of surface charge for
protein-solvent interaction suggests that a change of perception may be needed
since from solvation perspective folding into a native state is to optimize
surface negative charge rather than to minimize the hydrophobic surface area.

1605.01219	q-bio	q-bio.GN q-bio.MN q-bio.PE	Evolution of transcription factor families along the human lineage	"  Transcription factors (TFs) exert their regulatory action by binding to DNA
with specific sequence preferences. However, different TFs can partially share
their binding sequences. This ""redundancy"" of binding defines a way of
organizing TFs in ""motif families"" that goes beyond the usual classification
based on protein structural similarities. Since the TF binding preferences
ultimately define the target genes, the motif family organization entails
information about the structure of transcriptional regulation as it has been
shaped by evolution. Focusing on the human lineage, we show that a
one-parameter evolutionary model of the Birth-Death-Innovation type can explain
the empirical repartition of TFs in motif families, thus identifying the
relevant evolutionary forces at its origin. More importantly, the model allows
to pinpoint few deviations in human from the neutral scenario it assumes: three
over-expanded families corresponding to HOX and FOX type genes, a set of
""singleton"" TFs for which duplication seems to be selected against, and an
higher-than-average rate of diversification of the binding preferences of TFs
with a Zinc Finger DNA binding domain. Finally, a comparison of the TF motif
family organization in different eukaryotic species suggests an increase of
redundancy of binding with organism complexity.

Shannon's mutual information between two random variables to the multivariate
case involving more than two random variables. With proper model reductions, we

1605.01279	q-bio	q-bio.SC	"Uniform asymptotic approximation of diffusion to a small target:
  generalized reaction models"	"  The diffusion of a reactant to a binding target plays a key role in many
biological processes. The reaction-radius at which the reactant and target may
interact is often a small parameter relative to the diameter of the domain in
which the reactant diffuses. We develop uniform in time asymptotic expansions
in the reaction-radius of the full solution to the corresponding diffusion
equations for two separate reactant-target interaction mechanisms: the Doi or
volume reactivity model, and the Smoluchowski-Collins-Kimball partial
absorption surface reactivity model. In the former, the reactant and target
react with a fixed probability per unit time when within a specified
separation. In the latter, upon reaching a fixed separation, they
probabilistically react or the reactant reflects away from the target.
Expansions of the solution to each model are constructed by projecting out the
contribution of the first eigenvalue and eigenfunction to the solution of the
diffusion equation, and then developing matched asymptotic expansions in
Laplace-transform space. Our approach offers an equivalent, but alternative,
method to the pseudo-potential approach we previously employed in [Isaacson and
Newby 2013] for the simpler Smoluchowski pure absorption reaction mechanism. We
find that the resulting asymptotic expansions of the diffusion equation
solutions are identical with the exception of one parameter: the diffusion
limited reaction rates of the Doi and partial absorption models. This
demonstrates that for biological systems in which the reaction-radius is a
small parameter, properly calibrated Doi and partial absorption models may be
functionally equivalent.

  and the stability of the canonical B form"	"  Although carbon nanotubes are potential candidates for DNA encapsulation and
subsequent delivery of biological payloads to living cells, the thermodynamical
spontaneity of DNA encapsulation under physiological conditions is still a
matter of debate. Using enhanced sampling techniques, we show for the first
time that, given a sufficiently large carbon nanotube, the confinement of a
double-stranded DNA segment, 5'-D(*CP*GP*CP*GP*AP*AP*TP*TP*CP*GP*CP*G)-3', is
thermodynamically favourable under physiological environments (134 mM, 310 K, 1
bar), leading to DNA-nanotube hybrids with lower free energy than the
unconfined biomolecule. A diameter threshold of 3 nm is established below which
encapsulation is inhibited. The confined DNA segment maintains its
translational mobility and exhibits the main geometrical features of the
canonical B form. To accommodate itself within the nanopore, the DNA end-to-end
length increases from 3.85 nm up to approximately 4.1 nm, due to a 0.3 nm
elastic expansion of the strand termini. The canonical Watson-Crick H-bond
network is essentially conserved throughout encapsulation, showing that the
contact between the DNA segment and the hydrophobic carbon walls results in
minor rearrangements of the nucleotides H-bonding. The results obtained here
are paramount to the usage of carbon nanotubes as encapsulation media for next
generation drug delivery technologies.

optimal coding. The structure of the derivation is reminiscent of Mandelbrot's
random typing model but it has multiple advantages over random typing: (1) it
starts from realistic cognitive pressures (2) it does not require fine tuning
of parameters and (3) it sheds light on the origins of other statistical laws
of language and thus can lead to a compact theory of linguistic laws. Our
findings suggest that the recurrence of Zipf's law in human languages could
originate from pressure for easy and fast communication.

1605.01441	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"The Dorsal Striatum and the Dynamics of the Consensus Connectomes in the
  Frontal Lobe of the Human Brain"	"  In the applications of the graph theory it is unusual that one considers
numerous, pairwise different graphs on the very same set of vertices. In the
case of human braingraphs or connectomes, however, this is the standard
situation: the nodes correspond to anatomically identified cerebral regions,
and two vertices are connected by an edge if a diffusion MRI-based workflow
identifies a fiber of axons, running between the two regions, corresponding to
the two vertices. Therefore, if we examine the braingraphs of $n$ subjects,
then we have $n$ graphs on the very same, anatomically identified vertex set.
It is a natural idea to describe the $k$-frequently appearing edges in these
graphs: the edges that are present between the same two vertices in at least
$k$ out of the $n$ graphs. Based on the NIH-funded large Human Connectome
Project's public data release, we have reported the construction of the
Budapest Reference Connectome Server \url{http://connectome.pitgroup.org} that
generates and visualizes these $k$-frequently appearing edges. We call the
graphs of the $k$-frequently appearing edges ""$k$-consensus connectomes"" since
an edge could be included only if it is present in at least $k$ graphs out of
$n$. Considering the whole human brain, we have reported a surprising property
of these consensus connectomes earlier. In the present work we are focusing on
the frontal lobe of the brain, and we report here a similarly surprising
dynamical property of the consensus connectomes when $k$ is gradually changed
from $k=n$ to $k=1$: the connections between the nodes of the frontal lobe are
seemingly emanating from those nodes that were connected to sub-cortical
structures of the dorsal striatum: the caudate nucleus, and the putamen. We
hypothesize that this dynamic behavior copies the axonal fiber development of
the frontal lobe.

inter-gene interactions, which usually relies on all-pairs correlation (or
similar measure) computation between gene expression profiles across multiple
samples. Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) is one widely used technique
for gene co-expression network construction. However, all-pairs PCC computation
is computationally demanding for large numbers of gene expression profiles,
thus motivating our acceleration of its execution using high-performance
computing. In this paper, we present LightPCC, the first parallel and
distributed all-pairs PCC computation on Intel Xeon Phi (Phi) clusters. It
achieves high speed by exploring the SIMD-instruction-level and thread-level
parallelism within Phis as well as accelerator-level parallelism among multiple
Phis. To facilitate balanced workload distribution, we have proposed a general
framework for symmetric all-pairs computation by building bijective functions
between job identifier and coordinate space for the first time. We have
evaluated LightPCC and compared it to two CPU-based counterparts: a sequential
C++ implementation in ALGLIB and an implementation based on a parallel general
matrix-matrix multiplication routine in Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) (all
use double precision), using a set of gene expression datasets. Performance
evaluation revealed that with one 5110P Phi and 16 Phis, LightPCC runs up to
$20.6\times$ and $218.2\times$ faster than ALGLIB, and up to $6.8\times$ and
$71.4\times$ faster than single-threaded MKL, respectively. In addition,
LightPCC demonstrated good parallel scalability in terms of number of Phis.

  behavioral research"	"  In behavioral and psychiatric research, data consisting of a per-subject
proportion of ""successes"" and ""failures"" over a finite number of trials often
arise. This kind of clustered binary data are usually non-normally distributed,
which can cause issues with parameter estimation and predictions if the usual
general linear model is applied and sample size is small. Here we studied the
performances of some of the available analytic methods applicable to the
analysis of proportion data; namely linear regression, Poisson regression,
beta-binomial regression and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs). We report
the conclusions from a simulation study evaluating power and Type I error rates
of these models in scenarios akin to those met by behavioral researchers and
differing in sample size, cluster size and fixed effects parameters; plus, we
describe results from the application of these methods on data from two real
behavioral experiments. Our results show that, while GLMMs and beta-binomial
regression are powerful instruments for the analysis of clustered binary
outcomes, linear approximation can still provide reliable hypothesis testing in
this context. Poisson regression, on the other hand, can suffer heavily from
model misspecification when used to model proportion data. We conclude
providing some guidelines for the choice of appropriate analytical instruments,
sample and cluster size depending on the conditions of the experiment.

  reactions"	"  Statistical mechanics provides an effective framework to investigate
information processing in biochemical reactions. Within such framework
far-reaching analogies are established among (anti-) cooperative collective
behaviors in chemical kinetics, (anti-)ferromagnetic spin models in statistical
mechanics and operational amplifiers/flip-flops in cybernetics. The underlying
modeling -- based on spin systems -- has been proved to be accurate for a wide
class of systems matching classical (e.g. Michaelis--Menten, Hill, Adair)
scenarios in the infinite-size approximation. However, the current research in
biochemical information processing has been focusing on systems involving a
relatively small number of units, where this approximation is no longer valid.
Here we show that the whole statistical mechanical description of reaction
kinetics can be re-formulated via a mechanical analogy -- based on completely
integrable hydrodynamic-type systems of PDEs -- which provides explicit
finite-size solutions, matching recently investigated phenomena (e.g.
noise-induced cooperativity, stochastic bi-stability, quorum sensing). The
resulting picture, successfully tested against a broad spectrum of data,
constitutes a neat rationale for a numerically effective and theoretically
consistent description of collective behaviors in biochemical reactions.

fine visuomotor task called the boundary avoidance task (BAT). The BAT has been
known to induce naturally occurring failures of human-machine coupling in high
performance aircraft that can potentially lead to a crash; these failures are
termed pilot induced oscillations (PIOs). Approach. We recorded EEG and
pupillometry data from human subjects engaged in a flight BAT simulated within
a virtual 3D environment. Main results. We find that workload buildup in a BAT
can be successfully decoded from oscillatory features in the
electroencephalogram (EEG). Information in delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma
spectral bands of the EEG all contribute to successful decoding, however gamma
band activity with a lateralized somatosensory topography has the highest
contribution, while theta band activity with a frontocentral topography has the
most robust contribution in terms of real world usability. We show that the
output of the spectral decoder can be used to predict PIO susceptibility. We
also find that workload buildup in the task induces pupil dilation, the
magnitude of which is significantly correlated with the magnitude of the
decoded EEG signals. These results suggest that PIOs may result from the
dysregulation of cortical networks such as the locus coeruleus (LC) anterior
cingulate cortex (ACC) circuit. Significance. Our findings may generalize to
similar control failures in other cases of tight man machine coupling where
gains and latencies in the control system must be inferred and compensated for
by the human operators. A closed-loop intervention using neurophysiological
decoding of workload buildup that targets the LC ACC circuit may positively
impact operator performance in such situations.

often requires significant interventions from users, which has become a
bottleneck for future automated electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). Here we
report a deep learning framework, called DeepPicker, to address this problem
and fill the current gaps toward a fully automated cryo-EM pipeline. DeepPicker
employs a novel cross-molecule training strategy to capture common features of
particles from previously-analyzed micrographs, and thus does not require any
human intervention during particle picking. Tests on the recently-published
cryo-EM data of three complexes have demonstrated that our deep learning based
scheme can successfully accomplish the human-level particle picking process and
identify a sufficient number of particles that are comparable to those manually
by human experts. These results indicate that DeepPicker can provide a
practically useful tool to significantly reduce the time and manual effort
spent in single-particle analysis and thus greatly facilitate high-resolution
cryo-EM structure determination.

morphogen density distributions on the membrane. The equation is developed in a
two-dimensional coordinate system mapped on the membrane, referred to as the
membrane coordinates. When the membrane expands, the membrane coordinates
expand in the same manner so that the membrane is invariant in the coordinates.
In the membrane coordinate system, the transformation of membrane is described
with a time-derivative equation for metric tensors. By defining relationships
between morphogen density distributions and the direction and rate of cell
division, trajectories of membrane transformation are obtained in terms of the
morphogen distributions. An example of the membrane transformation is shown

perfect assembly; i.e., given a set of reads from a long genome sequence, is it
possible to perfectly reconstruct the original sequence? In practice, however,
it is very often the case that the read data is not sufficiently rich to permit
unambiguous reconstruction of the original sequence. While a natural
generalization of the perfect assembly formulation to these cases would be to
consider a rate-distortion framework, partial assemblies are usually
represented in terms of an assembly graph, making the definition of a
distortion measure challenging. In this work, we introduce a distortion
function for assembly graphs that can be understood as the logarithm of the
number of Eulerian cycles in the assembly graph, each of which correspond to a
candidate assembly that could have generated the observed reads. We also
introduce an algorithm for the construction of an assembly graph and analyze

signals were recorded during these sessions. The signals from the two front

discovered that compared to the resting sessions, reading session is
characterized by a lower number of blinks. However, there was no significant
difference in standard deviation in the blink rate variability. We also noticed
that in terms of complexity measures, the blink rate variability is located
somewhere in between white and pink noises, being closer to the white noise
during reading. We also found that the average of inter-blink intervals
increases during reading/memorization, thus longer inter-blink intervals could

high-resolution imaging in the structurally intact brain. Anatomically
annotating CLARITY brains is necessary for discovering which regions contain
signals of interest. Manually annotating whole-brain, terabyte CLARITY images
is difficult, time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone. Automatically
registering CLARITY images to a pre-annotated brain atlas offers a solution,
but is difficult for several reasons. Removal of the brain from the skull and
subsequent storage and processing cause variable non-rigid deformations, thus
compounding inter-subject anatomical variability. Additionally, the signal in
CLARITY images arises from various biochemical contrast agents which only
sparsely label brain structures. This sparse labeling challenges the most
commonly used registration algorithms that need to match image histogram
statistics to the more densely labeled histological brain atlases. The standard
method is a multiscale Mutual Information B-spline algorithm that dynamically
generates an average template as an intermediate registration target. We
determined that this method performs poorly when registering CLARITY brains to
the Allen Institute's Mouse Reference Atlas (ARA), because the image histogram
statistics are poorly matched. Therefore, we developed a method (Mask-LDDMM)
for registering CLARITY images, that automatically find the brain boundary and
learns the optimal deformation between the brain and atlas masks. Using
Mask-LDDMM without an average template provided better results than the
standard approach when registering CLARITY brains to the ARA. The LDDMM
pipelines developed here provide a fast automated way to anatomically annotate
CLARITY images. Our code is available as open source software at

  Association Studies"	"  Genetic variants identified to date by genome-wide association studies only
explain a small fraction of total heritability. Gene-by-gene interaction is one
important potential source of unexplained heritability. In the first part of
this dissertation, a novel approach to detect such interactions is proposed.
This approach utilizes penalized regression and sparse estimation principles,
and incorporates outside biological knowledge through a network-based penalty.
The method is tested on simulated data under various scenarios. Simulations
show that with reasonable outside biological knowledge, the new method performs
noticeably better than current stage-wise strategies, especially when the
marginal strength of main effects is weak.
  The proposed method is designed for single-cohort analyses. However, it is
generally acknowledged that only multi-cohort analyses have sufficient power to
uncover genes and gene-by-gene interactions with moderate effects on traits,
such as likely underlie complex diseases. Multi-cohort, meta-analysis
approaches for penalized regressions are developed and investigated in the
second part of this dissertation. Specifically, I propose two different ways of
utilizing data-splitting principles in multi-cohort settings and develop three
procedures to conduct meta-analysis. Using the method developed in the first
part of this dissertation as an example of penalized regressions, three
proposed meta-analysis procedures are compared to mega-analysis using a
simulation study. The results suggest that the best approach is to split the
participating cohorts into two groups.
  In the last part of this dissertation, the novel method developed in the
first part is applied to the Framingham Heart Study measures on total plasma

  product levels"	"  Expression of many genes varies as a cell transitions through different
cell-cycle stages. How coupling between stochastic expression and cell cycle
impacts cell-to-cell variability (noise) in the level of protein is not well
understood. We analyze a model, where a stable protein is synthesized in random
bursts, and the frequency with which bursts occur varies within the cell cycle.
Formulas quantifying the extent of fluctuations in the protein copy number are
derived and decomposed into components arising from the cell cycle and
stochastic processes. The latter stochastic component represents contributions
from bursty expression and errors incurred during partitioning of molecules
between daughter cells. These formulas reveal an interesting trade-off:
cell-cycle dependencies that amplify the noise contribution from bursty
expression also attenuate the contribution from partitioning errors. We
investigate existence of optimum strategies for coupling expression to the cell
cycle that minimize the stochastic component. Intriguingly, results show that a
zero production rate throughout the cell cycle, with expression only occurring
just before cell division minimizes noise from bursty expression for a fixed
mean protein level. In contrast, the optimal strategy in the case of
partitioning errors is to make the protein just after cell division. We provide
examples of regulatory proteins that are expressed only towards the end of cell
cycle, and argue that such strategies enhance robustness of cell-cycle
decisions to the intrinsic stochasticity of gene expression.

  multi-view matrix factorisations"	"  Men and women differ in specific cognitive abilities and in the expression of
several neuropsychiatric conditions. Such findings could be attributed to sex
hormones, brain differences, as well as a number of environmental variables.
Existing research on identifying sex-related differences in brain structure
have predominantly used cross-sectional studies to investigate, for instance,
differences in average gray matter volumes (GMVs). In this article we explore
the potential of a recently proposed multi-view matrix factorisation (MVMF)
methodology to study structural brain changes in men and women that occur from
adolescence to adulthood. MVMF is a multivariate variance decomposition
technique that extends principal component analysis to ""multi-view"" datasets,
i.e. where multiple and related groups of observations are available. In this
application, each view represents a different age group. MVMF identifies latent
factors explaining shared and age-specific contributions to the observed
overall variability in GMVs over time. These latent factors can be used to
produce low-dimensional visualisations of the data that emphasise age-specific
effects once the shared effects have been accounted for. The analysis of two
datasets consisting of individuals born prematurely as well as healthy controls
provides evidence to suggest that the separation between males and females
becomes increasingly larger as the brain transitions from adolescence to
adulthood. We report on specific brain regions associated to these variance
effects.

which naturally leads to a filtration by their topological genus. Within this
framework, RNA secondary structures correspond to pk-structures of genus zero.
{\it RNAFeatures$^*$} acts on formal, arc-labeled RNA secondary structures,
called $\lambda$-structures. $\lambda$-structures correspond one-to-one to
pk-structures together with some additional information. This information
consists of the specific rearrangement of the backbone, by which a pk-structure
can be made cross-free. {\it RNAFeatures$^*$} is an extension of the grammar
for secondary structures and employs an enhancement by labelings of the symbols
as well as the production rules. We discuss how to use {\it RNAFeatures$^*$} to
obtain a stochastic context-free grammar for pk-structures, using data of RNA
sequences and structures. The induced grammar facilitates fast Boltzmann
sampling and statistical analysis. As a first application, we present an $O(n
log(n))$ runtime algorithm which samples pk-structures based on ninety tRNA
sequences and structures from the Nucleic Acid Database (NDB).

structural stability of equilibriums, arising from real dynamical systems. We
show that dynamical stability, quantified via systems local response to
external perturbations, coincides with the minimal internal perturbation able
to destabilize the equilibrium. First, by reformulating a result of control
theory, we explain that harmonic external perturbations reflect the spectral
sensitivity of the Jacobian matrix at the equilibrium, with respect to constant
changes of its coefficients. However, for this equivalence to hold, imaginary
changes of the Jacobian's coefficients have to be allowed. The connection with
dynamical stability is thus lost for real dynamical systems. We show that this
issue can be avoided, thus recovering the fundamental link between dynamical
and structural stability, by considering stochastic noise as external and
internal perturbations. More precisely, we demonstrate that a system's local
response to white-noise perturbations directly reflects the intensity of
internal white noise that it can accommodate before asymptotic mean-square
stability of the equilibrium is lost.

  endocytosis and phagocytosis"	"  Phagocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis are vitally important particle
uptake mechanisms in many cell types, ranging from single-cell organisms to
immune cells. In both processes, engulfment by the cell depends critically on
both particle shape and orientation. However, most previous theoretical work
has focused only on spherical particles and hence disregards the wide-ranging
particle shapes occurring in nature, such as those of bacteria. Here, by
implementing a simple model in one and two dimensions, we compare and contrast
receptor-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis for a range of biologically
relevant shapes, including spheres, ellipsoids, capped cylinders, and
hourglasses. We find a whole range of different engulfment behaviors with some
ellipsoids engulfing faster than spheres, and that phagocytosis is able to
engulf a greater range of target shapes than other types of endocytosis.
Further, the 2D model can explain why some nonspherical particles engulf
fastest (not at all) when presented to the membrane tip-first (lying flat). Our
work reveals how some bacteria may avoid being internalized simply because of
their shape, and suggests shapes for optimal drug delivery.

1605.03005	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Shaping neural circuits by high order synaptic interactions	"  Spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) is believed to play an important
role in shaping the structure of neural circuits. Here we show that STDP
generates effective interactions between synapses of different neurons, which
were neglected in previous theoretical treatments, and can be described as a
sum over contributions from structural motifs. These interactions can have a
pivotal influence on the connectivity patterns that emerge under the influence
of STDP. In particular, we consider two highly ordered forms of structure: wide
synfire chains, in which groups of neurons project to each other sequentially,
and self connected assemblies. We show that high order synaptic interactions
can enable the formation of both structures, depending on the form of the STDP
function and the time course of synaptic currents. Furthermore, within a
certain regime of biophysical parameters, emergence of the ordered connectivity
occurs robustly and autonomously in a stochastic network of spiking neurons,
without a need to expose the neural network to structured inputs during
learning.

1605.03031	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Mapping the functional connectome traits of levels of consciousness	"  Examining task-free functional connectivity (FC) in the human brain offers
insights on how spontaneous integration and segregation of information relate
to human cognition, and how this organization may be altered in different
conditions, and neurological disorders. This is particularly relevant for
patients in disorders of consciousness (DOC) following severe acquired brain
damage and coma, one of the most devastating conditions in modern medical care.
We present a novel data-driven methodology, connICA, which implements
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for the extraction of robust independent
FC patterns (FC-traits) from a set of individual functional connectomes,
without imposing any a priori data stratification into groups. We here apply
connICA to investigate associations between network traits derived from
task-free FC and cognitive/clinical features that define levels of
consciousness. Three main independent FC-traits were identified and linked to
consciousness-related clinical features. The first one represents the
functional configuration it is associated to a sedative (sevoflurane), the
overall effect of the pathology and the level of arousal. The second FC-trait
reflects the disconnection of the visual and sensory-motor connectivity
patterns. It also relates to the time since the insult and to the ability of
communicating with the external environment. The third FC-trait isolates the
connectivity pattern encompassing the fronto-parietal and the default-mode
network areas as well as the interaction between left and right hemispheres,
which are also associated to the awareness of the self and its surroundings.
Each FC-trait represents a distinct functional process with a role in the
degradation of conscious states of functional brain networks, shedding further
light on the functional subcircuits that get disrupted in severe brain-damage.

1605.03060	q-bio	q-bio.NC	A Passage-of-time Model of the Cerebellar Purkinje Cell	"  The cerebellar Purkinje cell controlling eyeblinks can learn, remember and
reproduce the interstimulus interval in a classical conditioning paradigm.
Given temporally separated inputs, the cerebellar Purkinje cell learns to pause
its tonic inhibition of a motor pathway with high temporal precision so that an
overt blink occurs at the right time. Most models relegate the Purkinje cell's
passage-of-time representation to afferent granule cells, a subpopulation of
which is supposedly selected for synaptic depression in order to make the
Purkinje cell pause. However, granule cell models have recently faced two
crucial challenges: 1) bypassing granule cells and directly stimulating the
Purkinje cell's pre-synaptic fibers during training still produces a well-timed
pause, and 2) the Purkinje cell can reproduce the learned pause, invariant to
the temporal structure of probe stimulation. Here, we present a passage-of-time
model which is internal to the Purkinje cell and is invariant to probe
structure. The model accurately simulates the Purkinje cell learning mechanism
and makes testable electrophysiological predictions. Importantly, the model is
a numerical proof-of-principle for a biological learning mechanism which does
not rely on changes of synaptic strength.

  learning"	"  Learning and memory are acquired through long-lasting changes in synapses. In
the simplest models, such synaptic potentiation typically leads to runaway
excitation, but in reality there must exist processes that robustly preserve
overall stability of the neural system dynamics. How is this accomplished?
Various approaches to this basic question have been considered. Here we propose
a particularly compelling and natural mechanism for preserving stability of
learning neural systems. This mechanism is based on the global processes by
which metabolic resources are distributed to the neurons by glial cells.
Specifically, we introduce and study a model comprised of two interacting
networks: a model neural network interconnected by synapses which undergo
spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP); and a model glial network
interconnected by gap junctions which diffusively transport metabolic resources
among the glia and, ultimately, to neural synapses where they are consumed. Our
main result is that the biophysical constraints imposed by diffusive transport
of metabolic resources through the glial network can prevent runaway growth of
synaptic strength, both during ongoing activity and during learning. Our
findings suggest a previously unappreciated role for glial transport of
metabolites in the feedback control stabilization of neural network dynamics
during learning.

1605.03119	q-bio	q-bio.SC physics.bio-ph	Steric effects induce geometric remodeling of actin bundles in filopodia	"  Filopodia are ubiquitous fingerlike protrusions, spawned by many eukaryotic
cells, to probe and interact with their environments. Polymerization dynamics
of actin filaments, comprising the structural core of filopodia, largely
determine their instantaneous lengths and overall lifetimes. The polymerization
reactions at the filopodial tip require transport of G-actin, which enter the
filopodial tube from the filopodial base and diffuse toward the filament barbed
ends near the tip. Actin filaments are mechanically coupled into a tight bundle
by cross-linker proteins. Interestingly, many of these proteins are relatively
short, restricting the free diffusion of cytosolic G-actin throughout the
bundle and, in particular, its penetration into the bundle core. To investigate
the effect of steric restrictions on G-actin diffusion by the porous structure
of filopodial actin filament bundle, we used a particle-based stochastic
simulation approach. We discovered that excluded volume interactions result in
partial and then full collapse of central filaments in the bundle, leading to a
hollowed-out structure. The latter may further collapse radially due to the
activity of cross-linking proteins, hence producing conical-shaped filament
bundles. Interestingly, electron microscopy experiments on mature filopodia
indeed frequently reveal actin bundles that are narrow at the tip and wider at
the base. Overall, our work demonstrates that excluded volume effects in the
context of reaction-diffusion processes in porous networks may lead to
unexpected geometric growth patterns and complicated, history-dependent
dynamics of intermediate metastable configurations.

  components for dynamic networks"	"  Formal analysis of the emergent structural properties of dynamic networks is
largely uncharted territory. We focus here on the properties of forward
reachable sets (FRS) as a function of the underlying degree distribution and
edge duration. FRS are defined as the set of nodes that can be reached from an
initial seed via a path of temporally ordered edges; a natural extension of
connected component measures to dynamic networks. Working in a stochastic
framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of the
exponential growth rate of the FRS for temporal networks with both edge and
node dynamics. For networks with node dynamics, we calculate thresholds for the
growth of the FRS. The effects of finite population size are explored via
simulation and approximation. We examine how these properties vary by edge
duration and different cross-sectional degree distributions that characterize a
range of scientifically interesting normative outcomes (Poisson and Bernoulli).
The size of the forward reachable set gives an upper bound for the epidemic
size in disease transmission network models, relating this work to epidemic
modeling (Ferguson 2000, Eames 2004).

1605.03358	q-bio	q-bio.CB q-bio.MN	"Functional Characteristics of Gene Expression Motifs with Single and
  Dual Strategies of Regulation"	"  Transcriptional regulation by transcription factors and post-transcriptional
regulation by microRNAs constitute two major modes of regulation of gene
expression. While gene expression motifs incorporating solely transcriptional
regulation are well investigated, the dynamics of motifs with dual strategies
of regulation, i.e., both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation,
have not been studied as extensively. In this paper, we probe the dynamics of a
four-gene motif with dual strategies of regulation of gene expression. Some of
the functional characteristics are compared with those of a two-gene motif, the
genetic toggle, employing only transcriptional regulation. Both the motifs
define positive feedback loops with the potential for bistability and
hysteresis. The four-gene motif, contrary to the genetic toggle, is found to
exhibit bistability even in the absence of cooperativity in the regulation of
gene expression. The four-gene motif further exhibits a novel dynamical feature
in which two regions of monostability with linear threshold response are
separated by a region of bistability with digital response.
  Using the linear noise approximation (LNA), we further show that the
coefficient of variation (a measure of noise), associated with the protein
levels in the steady state, has a lower magnitude in the case of the four-gene
motif as compared to the case of the genetic toggle. We next compare
transcriptional with post-transcriptional regulation from an information
theoretic perspective. We focus on two gene expression motifs, Motif 1 with
transcriptional regulation and Motif 2 with post-transcriptional regulation.
  We show that amongst the two motifs, Motif 2 has a greater capacity for
information transmission for an extended range of parameter values.

activity of ganglion cells, which provide the sole visual input to the brain.
Recent advances have led to a detailed characterization of retinal activity and
stimulus encoding by large neural populations. The inverse problem of decoding,
where the stimulus is reconstructed from spikes, has received less attention,
in particular for complex input movies that should be reconstructed
""pixel-by-pixel"". We recorded around a hundred neurons from a dense patch in a
rat retina and decoded movies of multiple small discs executing
mutually-avoiding random motions. We constructed nonlinear (kernelized)
decoders that improved significantly over linear decoding results, mostly due
to their ability to reliably separate between neural responses driven by
locally fluctuating light signals, and responses at locally constant light
driven by spontaneous or network activity. This improvement crucially depended
on the precise, non-Poisson temporal structure of individual spike trains,
which originated in the spike-history dependence of neural responses. Our
results suggest a general paradigm in which downstream neural circuitry could
discriminate between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity on the basis of
higher-order statistical structure intrinsic to the incoming spike trains.

  approach for coronary artery disease"	"  Despite extensive research during the last decades, coronary artery disease
(CAD) remains the number one cause of death, responsible for near 50% of global
mortality. A main reason for this is that CAD has a complex inheritance and
etiology that unlike rare single gene disorders cannot fully be understood from
studies of of genes one-by-one.In parallel, studies that simultaneously assess
multiple, functionally associated genes are warranted. For this reason we
undertook the Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene Expression (STAGE) study that
besides careful clinical characterization and genome-wide DNA genotyping also
assessed the global gene expression profiles from seven CAD-relevant vascular
and metabolic tissues. In this thesis report we show that by integrating GWAS
with genetics of gene expression studies like STAGE, we can advance our
understanding from the perspective of multiple genes and gene variants acting
in conjunction to cause CAD in the form of regulatory gene networks. This is
done through developing new bioinformatics tools and applying them to
disease-specific, genetics of global gene expression studies like STAGE. These
tools are necessary to go beyond our current limited single-gene understanding
of complex traits, like CAD.

information among a deluge of distractors at any given time, either through
volitionally 'top-down' biasing, or driven by automatically 'bottom-up'

modulations for information processing. Nevertheless, instead of being limited
to perceive simple features, human and other advanced animals adaptively learn
the world into categories and abstract concepts from experiences, imparting the

human is more likely driven by attention basing on abstract perceptions, which

1605.03440	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Simplification, innateness, and the absorption of meaning from context:
  how novelty arises from gradual network evolution"	"  The theory of interaction-based evolution argues that, at the most basic
level of analysis, there is a third alternative for how adaptive evolution
works besides a) accidental mutation and natural selection and b) Lamarckism,
namely, c) information provided by natural selection on the fit between the
organism and its environment is absorbed by non-accidental mutation. This
non-accidental mutation is non-Lamarckian yet useful for evolution, and is due
to evolved and continually evolving mutational mechanisms operating in the germ
cells. However, this theory has left a fundamental problem open: If mutational
mechanisms are not Lamarckian---if they are not ""aware"" of the environment and
the macroscale phenotype---then how could heritable novelty be due to anything
other than accidental mutation? This paper aims to address this question by
arguing the following. Mutational mechanisms can be broadly construed as
enacting local simplification operations on the DNA in germ cells, along with
gene duplication. The joint action of these mutational operations and natural
selection provides simplification under performance pressure. This joint action
creates from preexisting biological interactions new elements that have the
inherent capacity to come together into unexpected useful interactions with
other such elements, thus explaining nature's tendency for cooption. Novelty
thus arises not from a local genetic accident but from gradual network-level
evolution. Many empirical observations are explained from this perspective,
from cooption and gene fusion at the molecular level, to the evolution of
behavior and instinct at the organismal level. Finally, the nature of
mutational mechanisms and the need to study them in detail are described, and a
connection is drawn between evolution and learning.

  Uncovers At the Group Level"	"  Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) has gained enormous popularity in the
neuroimaging community over the past few years. At the group level, most MVPA
studies adopt an ""information based"" approach in which the sign of the effect
of individual subjects is discarded and a non-directional summary statistic is
carried over to the second level. This is in contrast to a directional
""activation based"" approach typical in univariate group level analysis, in
which both signal magnitude and sign are taken into account. The transition
from examining effects in one voxel at a time vs. several voxels (univariate
vs. multivariate) has thus tacitly entailed a transition from directional to
non-directional signal definition at the group level. While a directional
group-level MVPA approach implies that individuals have similar multivariate
spatial patterns of activity, in a non-directional approach each individual may
have a distinct spatial pattern. Using an experimental dataset, we show that
directional and non-directional group-level MVPA approaches uncover distinct
brain regions with only partial overlap. We propose a method to quantify the
degree of spatial similarity in activation patterns over subjects. Applied to
an auditory task, we find higher values in auditory regions compared to control
regions.

  The cognitive neuroscience of de-automatization"	"  Meditation and hypnosis both aim to facilitate cognitive-emotional
flexibility, i.e., the ""de-automatization"" of thought and behavior. However,
little research or theory has addressed how internal thought patterns might
change after such interventions, even though alterations in the internal flow
of consciousness may precede externally observable changes in behavior. This
chapter outlines three mechanisms by which meditation or hypnosis might alter
or reduce automatic associations and elaborations of spontaneous thought: by an
overall reduction of the chaining of thoughts into an associative stream; by
de-automatizing and diversifying the content of thought chains (i.e.,
increasing thought flexibility or variety); and, finally, by re-automatizing
chains of thought along desired or valued paths (i.e., forming new, voluntarily
chosen mental habits). The authors discuss behavioral and cognitive
neuroscientific evidence demonstrating the influence of hypnosis and meditation
on internal cognition and highlight the putative neurobiological basis, as well
as potential benefits, of these forms of de-automatization.

incidents, and the heavy usage of antibiotics in hospitals, it has been assumed
that antibiotic resistance evolves in hospital environments. To test this
assumption, we studied resistance phenotypes of bacteria collected from patient
isolates at a community hospital over a 2.5-year period. A graphical model
analysis shows no association between resistance and patient information other
than time of arrival. This allows us to focus on time course data.
  We introduce a Hospital Transmission Model, based on negative binomial delay.
Our main contribution is a statistical hypothesis test called the Nosocomial
Evolution of Resistance Detector (NERD). It calculates the significance of
resistance trends occurring in a hospital. It can inform hospital staff about
the effects of various practices and interventions, can help detect clonal
outbreaks, and is available as an R-package.
  We applied the NERD method to each of the 16 antibiotics in the study via 16
hypothesis tests. For 13 of the antibiotics, we found that the hospital
environment had no significant effect upon the evolution of resistance; the
hospital is merely a piece of the larger picture. The p-values obtained for the
other three antibiotics (Cefepime, Ceftazidime and Gentamicin) indicate that
particular care should be taken in hospital practices with these antibiotics.
One of the three, Ceftazidime, was significant after accounting for multiple
hypotheses, indicating a trend of decreased resistance for this drug.

  Reaction-Diffusion Systems"	"  Computational systems biology has provided plenty of insights into cell
biology. Early on, the focus was on reaction networks between molecular
species. Spatial distribution only began to be considered mostly within the
last decade. However, calculations were restricted to small systems because of
tremendously high computational workloads. To date, application to the cell of
typical size with molecular resolution is still far from realization. In this
article, we present a new parallel stochastic method for particle
reaction-diffusion systems. The program called pSpatiocyte was created bearing
in mind reaction networks in biological cells operating in crowded
intracellular environments as the primary simulation target. pSpatiocyte
employs unique discretization and parallelization algorithms based on a
hexagonal close-packed lattice for efficient execution particularly on large
distributed memory parallel computers. For two-level parallelization, we
introduced isolated subdomain and tri-stage lockstep communication for
process-level, and voxel-locking techniques for thread-level. We performed a
series of parallel runs on RIKEN's K computer. For a fine lattice that had
relatively low occupancy, pSpatiocyte achieved 7686 times speedup with 663552
cores relative to 64 cores from the viewpoint of strong scaling and exhibited
74\% parallel efficiency. As for weak scaling, efficiencies at least 60% were
observed up to 663552 cores. In addition to computational performance,
diffusion and reaction rates were validated by theory and another
well-validated program and had good agreement. Lastly, as a preliminary example
of real-world applications, we present a calculation of the MAPK model, a
typical reaction network motif in cell signaling pathways.

almost all complex biological processes. Computational tools exploiting rapidly
growing genomic databases to characterize protein-protein interactions are
urgently needed. Such methods should connect multiple scales from evolutionary
conserved interactions between families of homologous proteins, over the
identification of specifically interacting proteins in the case of multiple
paralogs inside a species, down to the prediction of residues being in physical
contact across interaction interfaces. Statistical inference methods detecting
residue-residue coevolution have recently triggered considerable progress in
using sequence data for quaternary protein structure prediction; they require,
however, large joint alignments of homologous protein pairs known to interact.
The generation of such alignments is a complex computational task on its own;
application of coevolutionary modeling has in turn been restricted to proteins
without paralogs, or to bacterial systems with the corresponding coding genes
being co-localized in operons. Here we show that the Direct-Coupling Analysis
of residue coevolution can be extended to connect the different scales, and
simultaneously to match interacting paralogs, to identify inter-protein
residue-residue contacts and to discriminate interacting from noninteracting
families in a multiprotein system. Our results extend the potential
applications of coevolutionary analysis far beyond cases treatable so far.

dynamics, the individuals may be in two distinct states, namely in favor or
against a vaccination campaign. Individuals against the vaccination follow a
standard SIS model, whereas the pro-vaccine individuals can also be in a third

the majority-rule dynamics in groups with three individuals. We also consider
that the vaccine can give permanent or temporary immunization to the

set of biochemical reactions that are simultaneously self-sustaining and
autocatalytic. This notion of an autocatalytic set has been formalized
graph-theoretically (as `RAF'), leading to mathematical results and
polynomial-time algorithms that have been applied to simulated and real
chemical reaction systems. In this paper, we investigate the emergence of
autocatalytic sets in polymer models when the catalysis rate of each molecule
type is drawn from some probability distribution. We show that although the
average catalysis rate $f$ for RAFs to arise depends on this distribution, a
universal linear upper and lower bound for $f$ (with increasing system size)
still applies. However, the probability of the appearance (and size) of
autocatalytic sets can vary widely, depending on the particular catalysis
distribution. We use simulations to explore how tight the mathematical bounds
are, and the reasons for the observed variations. We also investigate the
impact of inhibition (where molecules can also inhibit reactions) on the
emergence of autocatalytic sets, deriving new mathematical and algorithmic
results.

to measure the dimensionality of the set response vectors, i.e. the dimension
of the space of linear combinations of neural population activity patterns in
response to specific task conditions. RS-fMRI measures the overlap between
response vectors even in brain areas displaying no discernible average
differential BOLD signal. We show how this property can be used to estimate the
neural response dimensionality in areas lacking macroscopic spatial patterning.
The importance of dimensionality derives from how it relates to a neural
circuit's functionality. As we show, the dimensionality of the response vectors
is predicted to be high in areas involved in multi-stream integration, while it
is low in areas where inputs from independent sources do not interact or merely
overlap linearly. Our method can be used to identify and functionally
characterize cortical circuits that integrate multiple independent information
pathways.

of brain regions that are directly linked to one another by white matter tracts
to allow for effective information transmission. Yet how individual differences
in these anatomical pathways may impact individual differences in learning
remains far from understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that individual
differences in the organization of structural networks supporting task
performance predict individual differences in the rate at which humans learn a
visuo-motor skill. Over the course of 6 weeks, twenty-two healthy adult
subjects practiced a discrete sequence production task, where they learned a
sequence of finger movements based on discrete visual cues. We collected
structural imaging data during four MRI scanning sessions spaced approximately
two weeks apart, and using deterministic tractography, structural networks were
generated for each participant to identify streamlines that connect cortical
and sub-cortical brain regions. We observed that increased white matter
connectivity linking early visual (but not motor) regions was associated with a
faster learning rate. Moreover, we observed that the strength of multi-edge
paths between motor and visual modules was also correlated with learning rate,
supporting the role of polysynaptic connections in successful skill
acquisition. Our results demonstrate that the combination of diffusion imaging
and tractography-based connectivity can be used to predict future individual
differences in learning capacity, particularly when combined with methods from
network science and graph theory.

  swim efficiently"	"  The motility of many parasites is critical for the infection process of their
host, as exemplified by the transmission cycle of the blood fluke Schistosoma
mansoni. In their human infectious stage, immature, submillimetre-scale forms
of the parasite known as cercariae swim in freshwater and infect humans by
penetrating through the skin. This infection causes Schistosomiasis, a
parasitic disease that is comparable to malaria in its global socio-economic
impact. Given that cercariae do not feed and hence have a finite lifetime of
around 12 hours, efficient motility is crucial for the parasite's survival and
transmission of Schistosomiasis. However, a first-principles understanding of
how cercariae swim is lacking. Via a combined experimental, theoretical and
robotics based approach, we demonstrate that cercariae propel themselves
against gravity by exploiting a unique elastohydrodynamic coupling. We show
that cercariae beat their tail in a periodic fashion while maintaining a fixed
flexibility near their posterior and anterior ends. The flexibility in these
regions allows an interaction between the fluid drag and bending resistance: an
elastohydrodynamic coupling, to naturally break time-reversal symmetry and
enable locomotion at small length-scales. We present a theoretical model, a
'T-swimmer', which captures the key swimming phenotype of cercariae. We further
validate our results experimentally through a macro-scale robotic realization
of the 'T-swimmer', explaining the unique forked-tail geometry of cercariae.
Finally, we find that cercariae maintain the flexibility at their posterior and
anterior ends at an optimal regime for efficient swimming, as predicted by our
theoretical model. We anticipate that our work sets the ground for linking the
swimming of S. mansoni cercariae to disease transmission and enables
explorations of novel strategies for Schistosomiasis prevention.

  neuronal networks"	"  Massively parallel recordings of spiking activity in cortical networks show
that covariances vary widely across pairs of neurons. Their low average is well
understood, but an explanation for the wide distribution in relation to the
static (quenched) disorder of the connectivity in recurrent random networks was
so far elusive. We here derive a finite-size mean-field theory that reduces a
disordered to a highly symmetric network with fluctuating auxiliary fields. The
exposed analytical relation between the statistics of connections and the
statistics of pairwise covariances shows that both, average and dispersion of
the latter, diverge at a critical coupling. At this point, a network of
nonlinear units transits from regular to chaotic dynamics. Applying these
results to recordings from the mammalian brain suggests its operation close to
this edge of criticality.

  models"	"  Peppytides is a coarse-grained, accurate, physical model of the polypeptide
chain. I have shared instructions to make your own polypeptide chain and STL
files of Peppytides in MAKE magazine in Jan 2014 issue. However, Peppytides
involves a lot of steps and assembly of units. People were asking me, 'Is there
any easier way to make these models?'. I have been at several workshops,
hands-on sessions, talks and a science events with Peppytides. From the
feedback that I got everywhere, most of the makers, teachers and students want
something that is 3D-Print-&-Go, or at least easier to make, even at the cost
of some features.
  I have designed a new version of the model, named PeppyChains, in which the
backbone chain of the model can be 3d-printed as a single unit. PeppyChains
design eliminates the assembling of parts to form the backbone chain, but with
the cost of losing the ability to use bias-magnets to favor certain phi/psi
angles in the backbone. I have been demonstrating PeppyChains at various talks
and workshops along with Peppytides, and I have received requests for making
the STL file public. On popular demand, here I am sharing this STL and
providing the step-by-step instructions to make PeppyChains. Just add the
hydrogen-bond magnets, paint and color-code the atoms, and you are ready to go!
No drilling. No time consuming assembly.

1605.04463	q-bio	q-bio.NC nlin.AO	"Diversity of emergent dynamics in competitive threshold-linear networks:
  a preliminary report"	"  Threshold-linear networks consist of simple units interacting in the presence
of a threshold nonlinearity. Competitive threshold-linear networks have long
been known to exhibit multistability, where the activity of the network settles
into one of potentially many steady states. In this work, we find conditions
that guarantee the absence of steady states, while maintaining bounded
activity. These conditions lead us to define a combinatorial family of
competitive threshold-linear networks, parametrized by a simple directed graph.
By exploring this family, we discover that threshold-linear networks are
capable of displaying a surprisingly rich variety of nonlinear dynamics,
including limit cycles, quasiperiodic attractors, and chaos. In particular,
several types of nonlinear behaviors can co-exist in the same network. Our
mathematical results also enable us to engineer networks with multiple dynamic
patterns. Taken together, these theoretical and computational findings suggest
that threshold-linear networks may be a valuable tool for understanding the
relationship between network connectivity and emergent dynamics.

1605.04468	q-bio	q-bio.BM	RNAiFold2T: Constraint Programming design of thermo-IRES switches	"  Motivation: RNA thermometers (RNATs) are cis-regulatory ele- ments that
change secondary structure upon temperature shift. Often involved in the
regulation of heat shock, cold shock and virulence genes, RNATs constitute an
interesting potential resource in synthetic biology, where engineered RNATs
could prove to be useful tools in biosensors and conditional gene regulation.
Results: Solving the 2-temperature inverse folding problem is critical for RNAT
engineering. Here we introduce RNAiFold2T, the first Constraint Programming
(CP) and Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithms to solve this problem.
Benchmarking tests of RNAiFold2T against existent programs (adaptive walk and
genetic algorithm) inverse folding show that our software generates two orders
of magnitude more solutions, thus allow- ing ample exploration of the space of
solutions. Subsequently, solutions can be prioritized by computing various
measures, including probability of target structure in the ensemble, melting
temperature, etc. Using this strategy, we rationally designed two thermosensor
internal ribosome entry site (thermo-IRES) elements, whose normalized
cap-independent transla- tion efficiency is approximately 50% greater at 42?C
than 30?C, when tested in reticulocyte lysates. Translation efficiency is lower
than that of the wild-type IRES element, which on the other hand is fully
resistant to temperature shift-up. This appears to be the first purely
computational design of functional RNA thermoswitches, and certainly the first
purely computational design of functional thermo-IRES elements. Availability:
RNAiFold2T is publicly available as as part of the new re- lease RNAiFold3.0 at
https://github.com/clotelab/RNAiFold and http:

  RNA-Sequencing data"	"  Single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) is a revolutionary technique for
discovering and describing cell types in heterogeneous tissues, yet its
measurement of expression often suffers from large systematic bias. A major
source of this bias is the cell cycle, which introduces large within-cell-type
heterogeneity that can obscure the differences in expression between cell
types. The current method for removing the cell-cycle effect is unable to
effectively identify this effect and has a high risk of removing other
biological components of interest, compromising downstream analysis. We present
ccRemover, a new method that reliably identifies the cell-cycle effect and
removes it. ccRemover preserves other biological signals of interest in the
data and thus can serve as an important pre-processing step for many scRNA-Seq
data analyses. The effectiveness of ccRemover is demonstrated using simulation
data and three real scRNA-Seq datasets, where it boosts the performance of
existing clustering algorithms in distinguishing between cell types.

biological activities in humans, including anticancer properties. Although
recent findings appear to support their role in cancer prevention and
treatment, this issue is still controversial. Anti-cancer activity of
phytochemicals mainly depends on their multi-target mechanism of action,
including antimutagenic, antioxidant and antiproliferative activities.
Furthermore, they may modulate the host immune response to cancer, reducing
inflammatory microenvironment and enhancing lymphocyte onco-surveillance. Since
carcinogenesis is multi-factorial and involves several signaling pathways,
multi-targeted agents as phytochemicals may represent promising anticancer
compounds. This narrative review aims to analyze the current literature on
phytochemicals highlighting their specific targets on carcinogenic molecular
pathways and their chemopreventive role. A full comprehension of their activity
at molecular and cellular levels will contribute for a better understanding of
phytochemical clinical efficacy, thus promoting the identification of new
effective plant-derived therapeutics.

  healthy and stroke subjects"	"  One use of EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in rehabilitation is
the detection of movement intention. In this paper we investigate for the first
time the instantaneous phase of movement related cortical potential (MRCP) and
its application to the detection of gait intention. We demonstrate the utility
of MRCP phase in two independent datasets, in which 10 healthy subjects and 9
chronic stroke patients executed a self-initiated gait task in three sessions.
Phase features were compared to more conventional amplitude and power features.
The neurophysiology analysis showed that phase features have higher
signal-to-noise ratio than the other features. Also, BCI detectors of gait
intention based on phase, amplitude, and their combination were evaluated under
three conditions: session specific calibration, intersession transfer, and
intersubject transfer. Results show that the phase based detector is the most
accurate for session specific calibration (movement intention was correctly
detected in 66.5% of trials in healthy subjects, and in 63.3% in stroke
patients). However, in intersession and intersubject transfer, the detector
that combines amplitude and phase features is the most accurate one and the
only that retains its accuracy (62.5% in healthy subjects and 59% in stroke
patients) w.r.t. session specific calibration. Thus, MRCP phase features
improve the detection of gait intention and could be used in practice to remove
time-consuming BCI recalibration.

  Turing systems"	"  We present a Bayesian methodology for infinite as well as finite dimensional
parameter identification for partial differential equation models. The Bayesian
framework provides a rigorous mathematical framework for incorporating prior
knowledge on uncertainty in the observations and the parameters themselves,
resulting in an approximation of the full probability distribution for the
parameters, given the data. Although the numerical approximation of the full
probability distribution is computationally expensive, parallelised algorithms
can make many practically relevant problems computationally feasible. The
probability distribution not only provides estimates for the values of the
parameters, but also provides information about the inferability of parameters
and the sensitivity of the model. This information is crucial when a
mathematical model is used to study the outcome of real-world experiments.
Keeping in mind the applicability of our approach to tackle real-world
practical problems with data from experiments, in this initial proof of concept
work, we apply this theoretical and computational framework to parameter
identification for a well studied semilinear reaction-diffusion system with
activator-depleted reaction kinetics, posed on evolving and stationary domains.

modules, we use a sample-saving method to construct condition-specific gene
co-expression network, and identify differentially expressed subnetworks as
conserved or condition specific modules which may be associated with biological

the method is also demonstrated by synthetic data as well as Daphnia magna gene

arc-representation of RNA secondary structures, we consider a model that
couples both I) the topological genus of the graph and II) the number of
crossing arcs of the corresponding primitive graph. We add a term proportional
to these topological invariants to the standard free energy of the RNA
molecule, thus obtaining a novel free energy parametrization which takes into
account the abundance of topologies of RNA pseudoknots observed in RNA

distances ~100 pc consisting of two main events: one at 1.7 to 3.2 million
years ago, and the other at 6.5 to 8.7 million years ago. These events are said
to be responsible for excavating the Local Bubble in the interstellar medium
and depositing 60Fe on Earth and the Moon. Other events are indicated by
effects in the local cosmic ray (CR) spectrum. Given this updated and refined
picture, we ask whether such supernovae are expected to have had substantial
effects on the terrestrial atmosphere and biota. In a first cut at the most
probable cases, combining photon and cosmic ray effects, we find that a
supernova at 100 pc can have only a small effect on terrestrial organisms from
visible light and that chemical changes such as ozone depletion are weak.
However, tropospheric ionization right down to the ground due to the
penetration of $\geq$TeV cosmic rays will increase by nearly an order of
magnitude for thousands of years, and irradiation by muons on the ground and in
the upper ocean will increase 20-fold, which will approximately triple the
overall radiation load on terrestrial organisms. Such irradiation has been
linked to possible changes in climate and increased cancer and mutation rates.
This may be related to a minor mass extinction around the Pliocene-Pleistocene
boundary, and further research on the effects is needed.

  properties and systems-level elements across bacteria"	"  The availability of databases electronically encoding curated regulatory
networks and of high-throughput technologies and methods to discover regulatory
interactions provides an invaluable source of data to understand the principles
underpinning the organization and evolution of these networks responsible for
cellular regulation. Nevertheless, data on these sources never goes beyond the
regulon level despite the fact that regulatory networks are complex
hierarchical-modular structures still challenging our understanding. This
brings the necessity for an inventory of systems across a large range of
organisms, a key step to rendering feasible comparative systems biology
approaches. In this work, we take the first step towards a global understanding
of the regulatory networks organization by making a cartography of the
functional architectures of diverse bacteria. Abasy (Across-bacteria systems)
Atlas provides a comprehensive inventory of annotated functional systems,
global network properties, and systems-level elements (global regulators,
modular genes shaping functional systems, basal machinery genes, and
intermodular genes) predicted by the natural decomposition approach for
reconstructed and meta-curated regulatory networks across a large range of
bacteria, including pathogenically and biotechnologically relevant organisms.
The meta-curation of regulatory datasets provides the most complete and
reliable set of regulatory interactions currently available. Abasy Atlas
contains systems and system-level elements for 50 regulatory networks
comprising 78,649 regulatory interactions covering 42 bacteria in nine taxa,
containing 3,708 regulons and 1,776 systems. All this brings together a large
corpus of data that will surely inspire studies to generate hypothesis
regarding the principles governing the evolution and organization of systems
and the functional architectures controlling them.

1605.04978	q-bio	physics.bio-ph cond-mat.soft q-bio.BM	Effects of RNA branching on the electrostatic stabilization of viruses	"  Many single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses self assemble from capsid protein
subunits and the nucleic acid to form an infectious virion. It is believed that
the electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged RNA and the
positively charged viral capsid proteins drive the encapsidation, although
there is growing evidence that the sequence of the viral RNA also plays a role
in packaging. In particular the sequence will determine the possible secondary
structures that the ssRNA will take in solution. In this work, we use a mean
field theory to investigate how the secondary structure of the RNA combined
with electrostatic interactions affects the efficiency of assembly and
stability of the assembled virions. We show that the secondary structure of RNA
may result in negative osmotic pressures while a linear polymer causes positive
osmotic pressures for the same conditions. This may suggest that the branched
structure makes the RNA more effectively packaged and the virion more stable.

sepsis occurring in approximately 7% to 10% of all neonates and in more than
25% of very low birth weight infants in NICU. The objective of this paper was
to determine if HRV, respiration and their relationships help to diagnose
infection in premature infants via non-invasive ways in NICU. Therefore, we
implement Mono-Channel (MC) and Bi-Channel (BC) Analysis in two groups: sepsis
(S) vs. non-sepsis (NS). Firstly, we studied RR series not only by linear
methods: time domain and frequency domain, but also by non-linear methods:
chaos theory and information theory. The results show that alpha Slow, alpha
Fast and Sample Entropy are significant parameters to distinguish S from NS.
Secondly, the question about the functional coupling of HRV and nasal
respiration is addressed. Local linear correlation coefficient r2t,f has been
explored, while non-linear regression coefficient h2 was calculated in two
directions. It is obvious that r2t,f within the third frequency band (0.2<f<0.4
Hz) and h2 in two directions were complementary approaches to diagnose sepsis.
Thirdly, feasibility study is carried out on the candidate parameters selected
from MC and BC respectively. We discovered that the proposed test based on
optimal fusion of 6 features shows good performance with the largest AUC and a
reduced probability of false alarm (PFA).

human electrocorticography in the signal dynamics of both motor and non-motor
cortical regions. We use a three-stage model of jPCA reduced-rank hidden Markov
model (jPCA-RR-HMM), regularized shrunken-centroid discriminant analysis (RDA),
and LASSO regression to extract direction-sensitive planning information and
movement onset in an upper-limb 3D isometric force task in a human subject.
This mode achieves a relatively high true positive force-onset prediction rate
of 60% within 250ms, and an above-chance 36% accuracy (17% chance) in
predicting one of six planned 3D directions of isometric force using
pre-movement signals. We also find direction-distinguishing information up to
400ms before force onset in the pre-movement signals, captured by electrodes
placed over the limb-ipsilateral dorsal premotor regions. This approach can
contribute to more accurate decoding of higher-level movement goals, at earlier
timescales, and inform sensor placement. Our results also contribute to further
understanding of the spatiotemporal features of human motor planning.

cells as a novel technology for cancer therapy. Even though studies report on
the successful use of NTAP to directly irradiate cancer cells, this technology
can cause cell death only in the upper 3-5 cell layers. We report on a NTAP
argon solution generated in DI water for treating human gastric cancer cells
(NCl-N87). Our findings showed that the plasma generated in DI water during a
30-minute treatment had the strongest affect in inducing apoptosis in cultured
human gastric cancer cells. This result can be attributed to presence of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) produced in
water during treatment. Furthermore, the data showed that elevated levels of
RNS may play an even more significant role than ROS in the rate of apoptosis in
gastric cancer cells.

approximating the true potential, that accurately captures meso-scale behavior
of the chemical or biological system using pairwise potentials coming from
experimental data or ab initio methods. The meso-scale behavior is translated
into logic rules for the dynamics. Each pairwise potential has an associated
logic function that is constructed using the logic rules, a class of elementary
logic functions, and AND, OR, and NOT gates. The effect of each logic function
is to turn its associated potential on and off. The N-body potential is
constructed as linear combination of the pairwise potentials, where the
""coefficients"" of the potentials are smoothed versions of the associated logic
functions. These potentials allow a potentially low-dimensional description of
complex processes while still accurately capturing the relevant physics at the
meso-scale. We present the proposed formalism to construct coarse-grained
potential models for three examples: an inhibitor molecular system, bond
breaking in chemical reactions, and DNA transcription from biology. The method
can potentially be used in reverse for design of molecular processes by
specifying properties of molecules that can carry them out.

integrated proviral DNA in long-lived cells despite years of suppressive
antiretroviral therapy (ART). To characterize establishment, turnover, and
evolution of viral DNA reservoirs we deep-sequenced the p17gag region of the
HIV-1 genome from samples obtained after 3-18 years of suppressive ART from 10
patients. For each of these patients, whole genome deep-sequencing data of
HIV-1 RNA populations before onset of ART were available from 6-12 longitudinal
plasma samples spanning 5-8 years of untreated infection. This enabled a
detailed analysis of the dynamics and origin of proviral DNA during ART. A
median of 14% (range 0-42%) of the p17gag DNA sequences were overtly defective
due to G-to-A hypermutation. The remaining sequences were remarkably similar to
previously observed RNA sequences and showed no evidence of evolution over many
years of suppressive ART. Most sequences from the DNA reservoirs were very
similar to viruses actively replicating in plasma (RNA sequences) shortly
before start of ART. The results do not support persistent HIV-1 replication as
a mechanism to maintain the HIV-1 reservoir during suppressive therapy. Rather,
the data indicate that viral DNA variants are turning over as long as patients
are untreated and that suppressive ART halts this turnover.

1605.05517	q-bio	q-bio.QM	"Parameter inference method for stochastic single-cell dynamics from
  tree-structured data"	"  With the advance of experimental techniques such as time-lapse fluorescence
microscopy, the availability of single-cell trajectory data has vastly
increased, and so has the demand for computational methods suitable for
parameter inference with this type of data. However, most of the currently
available methods treat single-cell trajectories independently, ignoring the
mother-daughter relationships and the information provided by population
structure. This information is however essential if a process of interest
happens at cell division, or if it evolves slowly compared to the duration of
the cell cycle. In this work, we highlight the importance of tracking cell
lineage trees and propose a Bayesian framework for parameter inference on
tree-structured data. Our method relies on a combination of Sequential Monte
Carlo for likelihood approximation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo for parameter
sampling. We demonstrate the capabilities of our inference framework on two
simple examples in which the lineage tree information is necessary: one in
which the cell phenotype can only switch at cell division and another where the
cell type fluctuates randomly over timescales that extend well beyond the
lifetime of a single cell.

balance between recency and primacy, and the initial recall (subsequent recalls
show smaller individual differences). All three memory properties are
relatively uncorrelated. The variance in the initial position may be a measure
of executive control and is correlated with total recall (the smaller the

  Working Memory Very Localized, Second Stage Delocalized, Both with Strong
  Tendencies to Forward Subsequent Recalls"	"  Recently it was shown that free recall consists of two stages: the first few
recalls empty working memory and a second stage concludes the recall (Tarnow,
2015; for a review of the theoretical prediction see Murdock, 1974). Here I
investigate conditional response probabilities in Murdock's 40-1 (1962) free
recall dataset. I find that the conditional response probabilities confirm the
presence of two stages. The first stage is characterized by a large enhancement
of the forward subsequent recall (up to 30 times chance) and a large
suppression of backward recalls (up to 26 times smaller than chance for recalls
between 10 and 40 items away). The second stage forward subsequent recall is
enhanced by a factor of 5 and the probability of backward and forward recalls
are concentrated at small distances. Thus both stages favor forward subsequent
recalls. As in Tarnow (2015), the first stage is much more localized than the
second stage. Working memory capacity is estimated in six ways to be about 4.5
word items for the 40-1 word list.

1605.05685	q-bio	q-bio.OT	"First direct evidence of two stages in free recall and three
  corresponding estimates of working memory capacity"	"  I find that exactly two stages can be seen directly in sequential free recall
distributions. These distributions show that the first three recalls come from
the emptying of working memory, recalls 6 and above come from a second stage
and the 4th and 5th recalls are mixtures of the two. A discontinuity, a rounded
step function, is shown to exist in the fitted linear slope of the recall
distributions as the recall shifts from the emptying of working memory
(positive slope) to the second stage (negative slope). The discontinuity leads
to a first estimate of the capacity of working memory at 4-4.5 items. Working
memory accounts for the recency effect. The primacy effect comes from the
second stage with a contribution also from working memory for short lists (the
first item). The different slopes of the working memory and secondary stages,
and that the two have different functional forms, accounts for the u-shaped
serial position curve. The total recall is shown to be a linear combination of
the content of working memory and items recalled in the second stage with
3.0-3.9 items coming from working memory, a second estimate of the capacity of
working memory. A third, separate upper limit on the capacity of working memory
is found (3.06 items), corresponding to the requirement that the content of
working memory cannot exceed the total recall, item by item. This third limit
presumably corresponds to the least chunked item. This is the best limit on the
capacity of unchunked working memory.
"
1605.05686	q-bio	q-bio.OT	"Free Recall Shows Similar Reactivation Behavior as Recognition & Cued
  Recall"	"  I find that the total retrieval time in word free recall increases linearly
with the total number of items recalled. Measured slopes, the time to retrieve
an additional item, vary from 1.4-4.5 seconds per item depending upon
presentation rate, subject age and whether there is a delay after list
presentation or not. These times to retrieve an additional item obey a second
linear relationship as a function of the recall probability averaged over the
experiment, explicitly independent of subject age, presentation rate and
whether there is a delay after the list presentation or not. This second linear
relationship mimics the relationships in recognition and cued recall (Tarnow,
2008) which suggests that free recall retrieval uses the same reactivation
mechanism as recognition or cued recall. Extrapolation limits the time to
retrieve an additional item to a maximum of 7.2 seconds per item if the
probability of recall is near 0%. Earlier upper limits for recognition and cued
recall varied with the item type between 0.2 and 1.8 seconds per item (Tarnow,
2008). Implications include that there are only two types of short term memory:

  Free Recall"	"  Recently it was shown that free recall consists of two stages: the first few
recalls empty the working memory and a second stage concludes the recall
(Tarnow, 2015; for a review of the theoretical prediction see Murdock, 1974).
It is commonly believed that a delay with a task before the recall starts
removes the content of working memory (Glanzer & Cunitz, 1966). Here is
presented the first direct evidence that this is indeed the case.

1605.05688	q-bio	q-bio.OT	"A Precise Measure of Working Memory Reveals Subjects Difficulties
  Managing Limited Capacity"	"  Free recall consists of two separate stages: the emptying of working memory
and reactivation [1]. The Tarnow Unchunkable Test (TUT, [2]) uses double
integer items to separate out only the first stage by making it difficult to
reactivate items due to the lack of intra-item relationships. 193 Russian
college students were tested via the internet version of the TUT. The average
number of items remembered in the 3 item test was 2.54 items. In the 4 item
test, the average number of items decreased to 2.38. This, and a number of
other qualitative distribution differences between the 3 and 4 item tests,
indicates that the average capacity limit of working memory has been reached at
3 items. This provides the first direct measurement of the unchunkable capacity
limit of language based items. That the average number of items remembered
decreased as the number of items increased from 3 to 4 indicates that most
subjects were unable to manage their working memories as the number of items
increased just beyond the average capacity. Further evidence for the difficulty
in managing the capacity limit is that 25% of subjects could not remember any
items correctly at least in one of three 4 item tests and that the Pearson
correlation between the 3 item and 4 item subject recalls was a relatively
small 38%. This failure of managing a basic memory resource should have
important consequences for pedagogy including instruction, text book design and
test design. Because working memory scores are important for academic
achievement, it also suggests that an individual can gain academically by
learning how to manage her or his capacity limit.

1605.05804	q-bio	q-bio.MN q-bio.CB	Shear-Induced Nitric Oxide Production by Endothelial Cells	"  We present a biochemical model of the wall shear stress (WSS)-induced
activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in an endothelial cell
(EC). The model includes three key mechanotransducers: mechanosensing ion
channels, integrins and G-protein-coupled receptors. The reaction cascade
consists of two interconnected parts. The first is rapid activation of calcium,
which results in formation of calcium-calmodulin complexes, followed by
recruitment of eNOS from caveolae. The second is phosphoryaltion of eNOS by
protein kinases PKC and AKT. The model also includes a negative feedback loop
due to inhibition of calcium influx into the cell by cyclic guanosine
monophosphate (cGMP). In this feedback, increased nitric oxide (NO) levels
cause an increase in cGMP levels, so that cGMP inhibition of calcium influx can
limit NO production. The model was used to predict the dynamics of NO
production by an EC subjected to a step increase of WSS from zero to a finite
physiologically relevant value. Among several experimentally observed features,
the model predicts a highly nonlinear, biphasic transient behavior of eNOS
activation and NO production: a rapid initial activation due to the very rapid
influx of calcium into the cytosol (occurring within 1 to 5 minutes) is
followed by a sustained period of activation due to protein kinases.

  Endonuclease Dependent Transcript Cutout"	"  We previously proposed the existence of DNA to DNA transcription in
eukaryotic cells, but the mechanism by which single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
transcript is produced and released from the genome remains unknown. We once
speculated that the mechanism of DNA to DNA transcription might be similar to
that of DNA to RNA transcription, but now we propose that endonuclease
dependent transcript cutout may be a possible mechanism of DNA to DNA
transcription, in which a copy of ssDNA fragment (transcript) between two nicks
produced by nicking endonuclease is released from double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
region in the genome by an unknown ssDNA fragment releasing enzyme. The gap in
the dsDNA will be filled through DNA repair mechanism. Occasionally, multiple
copies of ssDNA transcripts could be produced through multiple rounds of
cutout-repair-cutout cycle.

  variability analysis"	"  $\bullet$ Background : In Heart rate variability analysis, the rate-rate time
series suffer often from aperiodic non-stationarity, presence of ectopic beats
etc. It would be hard to extract helpful information from the original signals.
10 $\bullet$ Problem : Trend removal methods are commonly practiced to reduce
the influence of the low frequency and aperiodic non-stationary in RR data.
This can unfortunately affect the signal and make the analysis on detrended
data less appropriate. $\bullet$ Objective : Investigate the detrending effect
(linear \& nonlinear) in temporal / nonliear analysis of heart rate variability
of long-term RR data (in normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, 15
congestive heart failure and ventricular premature arrhythmia conditions).
$\bullet$ Methods : Temporal method : standard measure SDNN; Nonlinear methods
: multi-scale Fractal Dimension (FD), Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) \&
Sample Entropy (Sam-pEn) analysis. $\bullet$ Results : The linear detrending
affects little the global characteristics of the RR data, either 20 in temporal
analysis or in nonlinear complexity analysis. After linear detrending, the
SDNNs are just slightly shifted and all distributions are well preserved. The
cross-scale complexity remained almost the same as the ones for original RR
data or correlated. Nonlinear detrending changed not only the SDNNs
distribution, but also the order among different types of RR data. After this
processing, the SDNN became indistinguishable be-25 tween SDNN for normal sinus
rhythm and ventricular premature beats. Different RR data has different
complexity signature. Nonlinear detrending made the all RR data to be similar ,
in terms of complexity. It is thus impossible to distinguish them. The FD
showed that nonlinearly detrended RR data has a dimension close to 2, the
exponent from DFA is close to zero and SampEn is larger than 1.5 -- these
complexity values are very close to those for 30 random signal. $\bullet$
Conclusions : Pre-processing by linear detrending can be performed on RR data,
which has little influence on the corresponding analysis. Nonlinear detrending
could be harmful and it is not advisable to use this type of pre-processing.
Exceptions do exist, but only combined with other appropriate techniques to
avoid complete change of the signal's intrinsic dynamics. 35 Keywords $\bullet$

  approach"	"  Substrate-based cell motility is essential for fundamental biological
processes, such as tissue growth, wound healing and immune response. Even if a
comprehensive understanding of this motility mode remains elusive, progress has
been achieved in its modeling using a whole cell physical model. The model
takes into account the main mechanisms of cell motility - actin polymerization,
substrate mediated adhesion and actin-myosin dynamics and combines it with
steric cell-cell and hydrodynamic interactions. The model predicts the onset of
collective cell migration, which emerges spontaneously as a result of inelastic
collisions of neighboring cells. Each cell here modeled as an active polar gel,
is accomplished with two vortices if it moves. Open collision of two cells the
two vortices which come close to each other annihilate. This leads to a
rotation of the cells and together with the deformation and the reorientation
of the actin filaments in each cell induces alignment of these cells and leads
to persistent translational collective migration. The effect for low Reynolds
numbers is as strong as in the non-hydrodynamic model, but it decreases with
increasing Reynolds number.

reconstructed a deep matrilineal genealogy which includes recent Costa Rican

17th century, and compared their historic ethnic affinities with genetic
mitochondrial evidence of some living descendents. The observed DNA lineage has
an Amerindian ancestry. Such results point out that an Amerindian gene flow had
occurred into the Spanish group during the first generations of colonial

`structural zeros' which are microbes missing from an observation vector due to
an underlying biological process and not due to error in measurement. Typical
notions of missingness are insufficient to model these structural zeros. We
define a general framework which allows for structural zeros in the model and
propose methods of estimating sparse high dimensional covariance and precision
matrices under this setup. We establish error bounds in the spectral and
frobenius norms for the proposed esti- mators and empirically support them with
a simulation study. We also apply the proposed methodology to the global human
gut microbiome data of Yatsunenko (2012).

Molecular Genealogy, by giving us the opportunity to approach the study of
pedigrees from a new perspective, examining alive people at the same time than
collating records from their ancestors. A four generations matrilineal
genealogy is presented from Da. Angela Antunez (b. a. 1881 in Barcelona, Spain)
to their descendants in Cuba and Costa Rica. The observed mitochondrial lineage
has a substitution in the region HVR1 respect to the reference sequence (CRS)
and belongs to H haplogroup. This is consistent -as expected, with the recent
documented European lineage. This is an example of differential female
migration, in which women move to the husband's place of origin. Because of
patrilocal marriages are practiced in most societies, such migration mechanism
has had a major impact since the arrival of immigrant women bring new and
different lineages of mtDNA, which together with the admixture process
contributed to enrich the diversity and regionalization of the gene pool of

that the Spanish ruling elite emerged after the conquest was exclusively of
European origin. On the other side, recent technological advances in Genetics
give us the opportunity to approach the study of pedigrees from a new
perspective, examining alive people and simultaneously collating the historical
information of their ancestors. In this paper, a complete matrilineal genealogy
was reconstructed from nowadays ""white"" Costa Ricans to their ancestors in the
early Colonial society (XVI century). It was compared the correlation between
ethnic affiliations deduced from historical records with the genetic
inheritance from maternal lineages. The MtDNA lineage observed corresponds to a
Native American ancestry. These results show that some Amerindian gene flow
into the Spanish group must have occurred since the first generation of
Colonial society, a finding that contrasts with the prevailing ideas that the
Spanish elite avoided the intermarriage with other ethnic groups. Examples like
this one confirm that miscegenation began early in Costa Rica. So, those who
considered themselves ""Spaniards"" in the late colonial era, were actually
biologically mestizos. It is widely accepted, that the general Costa Rican
population is the result of an admixture process between Europeans, Amerindians
and Africans.

compared to the macroscopic behavior of the corresponding large-size system.
The mechanisms of this transition, which is known as the small-size transition,
can be attributed to either a relative increase in the noise intensity or to
the discreteness of the state space due to the small system size. The former
mechanism has been intensively investigated using several toy and realistic
models. However, the latter has rarely been analyzed and is sometimes confused
with the former, because a toy model that extracts the essence of the
discreteness-induced transition mechanism is lacking. In this work, we propose
a 1- and 3-body reaction system as a minimal model of the discreteness-induced
transition and derive the conditions under which this transition occurs in more
complex systems. This work enriches our understanding of the influence of small
system size on system behavior.

population information (macroscopic level), are deduced in an intuitive way.
These models, as for instance Verhulst, Gompertz and Bertalanffy models, are
posted in such a manner that all the parameters involved have physical
interpretation. A model based on the interaction (distance dependent) between
the individuals (microscopic level) is also presented. This microscopic model
reachs the phenomenological models presented as particular cases. In this
approach, the Verhulst model represents the situation in which all the
individuals interact in the same way, regardless of the distance between them.
That means Verhulst model is a kind of mean field model. The other
phenomenological models are reaching from the microscopic model according to
two quantities: i) the relation between the way that the interaction decays
with the distance; and ii) the dimension of the spatial structure formed by the
population. This microscopic model allows understanding population growth by
first principles, because it predicts that some phenomenological models can be
seen as a consequence of the same individual level kind of interaction. In this
sense, the microscopic model that will be discussed here paves the way to
finding universal patterns that are common to all types of growth, even in
systems of very different nature.

1605.06379	q-bio	q-bio.BM	Criteria for folding in structure-based models of proteins	"  In structure-based models of proteins, one often assumes that folding is
accomplished when all contacts are established. This assumption may frequently
lead to a conceptual problem that folding takes place in a temperature region
of very low thermodynamic stability, especially when the contact map used is
too sparse. We consider six different structure-based models and show that
allowing for a small, but model-dependent, percentage of the native contacts
not being established boosts the folding temperature substantially while
affecting the time scales of folding only in a minor way. We also compare other
properties of the six models. We show that the choice of the description of the
backbone stiffness has a substantial effect on the values of characteristic
temperatures that relate both to equilibrium and kinetic properties. Models
without any backbone stiffness (like the self-organized polymer) are found to
perform similar to those with the stiffness, including in the studies of
stretching.

It has been observed that its incidence is strongly influenced by temperature
and other abiotic factors like rainfall and humidity. In this work we compare
the effects of seasonality in temperature that affect the entomological
parameters of the mosquito with precipitation that affects the hatchery
capacity. We also analyze its joint action using a dynamical model for the life
cycle of Aedes aegypti and historical weather data from 8 regions of Mexico. We
found that the joint action of different mechanisms can enhance the prevalence
of the disease, but also inhibit it when they act in an asynchronous way. We
found that for the studied regions, the seasonality of the low temperature
rather than mean temperature is the main driving force of Dengue outbreaks. We
also analyzed the role of the diapause in these kinds of outbreaks. The
methodology developed here can be used to discover the underlying mechanism of
Dengue outbreaks in different regions and thus help to apply targeted control
measures.

medicine and developmental biology but also for biophysical studies. Yet, the
characterization of cultured stem cells at the level of morphology and
macroscopic patterns resulting from cell-to-cell interactions remain largely
qualitative, even though they are the simplest features observed in everyday
experiments. Here we report that neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which are
multipotent stem cells that give rise to cells in the central nervous system,
rapidly glide and stochastically reverse its velocity while locally aligning
with neighboring cells, thus showing features of an active nematic system.
Within the two-dimensional nematic pattern, we find interspaced topological
defects with +1/2 and -1/2 charges. Remarkably, we identified rapid cell
accumulation leading to three-dimensional mounds at the +1/2 topological
defects. Single-cell level imaging around the defects allowed quantification of
the evolving cell density, clarifying that not only cells concentrate at +1/2
defects, but also escape from -1/2 defects. We propose the mechanism of
instability around the defects as the interplay between the anisotropic
friction and the active force field, thus addressing a novel universal
mechanism for local cell density control.

  benefits of heterogeneity"	"  Evolutionary games on networks traditionally involve the same game at each
interaction. Here we depart from this assumption by considering mixed games,
where the game played at each interaction is drawn uniformly at random from a
set of two different games. While in well-mixed populations the random mixture
of the two games is always equivalent to the average single game, in structured
populations this is not always the case. We show that the outcome is in fact
strongly dependent on the distance of separation of the two games in the
parameter space. Effectively, this distance introduces payoff heterogeneity,
and the average game is returned only if the heterogeneity is small. For higher
levels of heterogeneity the distance to the average game grows, which often
involves the promotion of cooperation. The presented results support preceding
research that highlights the favorable role of heterogeneity regardless of its
origin, and they also emphasize the importance of the population structure in
amplifying facilitators of cooperation.

1605.06544	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Inference by Reparameterization in Neural Population Codes	"  Behavioral experiments on humans and animals suggest that the brain performs
probabilistic inference to interpret its environment. Here we present a new
general-purpose, biologically-plausible neural implementation of approximate
inference. The neural network represents uncertainty using Probabilistic
Population Codes (PPCs), which are distributed neural representations that
naturally encode probability distributions, and support marginalization and
evidence integration in a biologically-plausible manner. By connecting multiple
PPCs together as a probabilistic graphical model, we represent multivariate
probability distributions. Approximate inference in graphical models can be
accomplished by message-passing algorithms that disseminate local information
throughout the graph. An attractive and often accurate example of such an
algorithm is Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP), which uses local marginalization
and evidence integration operations to perform approximate inference
efficiently even for complex models. Unfortunately, a subtle feature of LBP
renders it neurally implausible. However, LBP can be elegantly reformulated as
a sequence of Tree-based Reparameterizations (TRP) of the graphical model. We
re-express the TRP updates as a nonlinear dynamical system with both fast and
slow timescales, and show that this produces a neurally plausible solution. By
combining all of these ideas, we show that a network of PPCs can represent
multivariate probability distributions and implement the TRP updates to perform
probabilistic inference. Simulations with Gaussian graphical models demonstrate
that the neural network inference quality is comparable to the direct
evaluation of LBP and robust to noise, and thus provides a promising mechanism
for general probabilistic inference in the population codes of the brain.

phenomenological model to account for the clustering properties of SNPs in the
human genome. The phenomenological model is based on a preferential mutation to
the closer proximity of existing SNPs. With the Hapmap SNP data, we empirically
demonstrate that the preferential model is better for illustrating the
clustered distribution of SNPs than the random model. Moreover, the model is
applicable not only to autosomes but also to the X chromosome, although the X
chromosome has different characteristics from autosomes. The analysis of the
estimated parameters in the model can explain the pronounced population
structure and the low genetic diversity of the X chromosome. In addition,
correlation between the parameters reveals the population-wise difference of
the mutation probability. These results support the mutational non-independence
hypothesis against random mutation.

worms (Onychophora), rare invertebrates that are considered ""living fossils"",
have full placental organs and capture prey with a rough ""net"" built in a
fraction of a second. Study Design: This study is a combination of field
interviews, online surveys and automatic database search. Methods: We asked
open-ended questions to farmers who know the worms, consulted experts and
searched the Internet to document folkloric and artistic instances using all
the names that these animals receive in English, Spanish and Portuguese
(languages of the countries where they occur) as well as other languages, and
automatic image search, in Web of Science, CrossRef, Google Scholar and Google.
Results: We found more than 80 cases of direct references to velvet worms in
folklore and art, mostly from the USA, Australia, Brazil, Costa Rica and New
Zealand. Per capita the countries with more cases are New Zealand (24 cases per
million inhabitants), Costa Rica (16 cases per million inhabitants) and
Australia (3 cases per million inhabitants). The most frequent expressions are
cartoons, followed by tourism agencies using velvet worms in their ads,
products with velvet worm representations, folkloric beliefs, and music bands
or songs named after them. In almost all cases the animals are seen in a
favorable light, inspiring folklore and art that highlight their extraordinary
nature. Conclusion: The unique prey capture mechanism of velvet worms seems to
have inspired an unexpected number of artistic and folkloric expressions,
preserved for the future in the present article, which starts a totally new

recorded data by the Neurologist, with the purpose of checking the occurrence
of transient waveforms called interictal epileptiform discharges. These
waveforms have short duration (less than 100 ms), so the inspection process is
usually time-consuming, particularly for ambulatory long term EEG records.
Therefore, an automatic detection system of epileptiform discharges can be a
valuable tool for a Neurology service. The proposed approach is the development
of a multi stage detection algorithm, which processes the complete EEG signals
and applies decision criteria to selected waveforms. It employs EEG analysis
techniques such as Wavelet Transform and Mimetic Analysis, complemented with a
classification based on Fuzzy Logic. In order to evaluate the algorithm's
performance, data were collected from several epileptic patients, with
epileptiform activity marked by a Neurologist. The average values obtained for
both Sensitivity and Specificity were respectively higher than 80 and 70
percent.

Many qualitative features of the emerging collective phenomena, such as
correlated activity, stability, response to inputs, chaotic and regular
behavior, can, however, be understood in simple models that are accessible to a
treatment in statistical mechanics, or, more precisely, classical statistical
field theory.
  This tutorial presents the fundamentals behind contemporary developments in
the theory of neural networks of rate units that are based on methods from
statistical mechanics of classical systems with a large number of interacting
degrees of freedom. In particular we will focus on a relevant class of systems
that have quenched (time independent) disorder. In neural networks, the main
source of disorder arises from random synaptic couplings between neurons. These
systems are in many respects similar to spin glasses. The tutorial therefore
also explains the methods for these disordered systems as far as they are
applied in neuroscience.
  The presentation consists of two parts. In the first part we introduce
stochastic differential equations in the Martin - Siggia - Rose - De Dominicis
- Janssen path integral formalism. In the second part we employ this language
to derive the dynamic mean-field theory for deterministic random networks, the
basis of the seminal work by Sompolinsky, Crisanti, Sommers 1988, as well as a
recent extension to stochastic dynamics.

  cholera transmission and loss of immunity"	"  Mathematical models of cholera and waterborne disease vary widely in their
structures, in terms of transmission pathways, loss of immunity, and other
features. These differences may yield different predictions and parameter
estimates from the same data. Given the increasing use of models to inform
public health decision-making, it is important to assess distinguishability
(whether models can be distinguished based on fit to data) and inference
robustness (whether model inferences are robust to realistic variations in
model structure). We examined the effects of uncertainty in model structure in
epidemic cholera, testing a range of models based on known features of cholera
epidemiology. We fit to simulated epidemic and long-term data, as well as data
from the 2006 Angola epidemic. We evaluated model distinguishability based on
data fit, and whether parameter values and forecasts can accurately be inferred
from incidence data. In general, all models were able to successfully fit to
all data sets, even if misspecified. However, in the long-term data, the best
model fits were achieved when the loss of immunity form matched those of the
model that simulated the data. Two transmission and reporting parameters were
accurately estimated across all models, while the remaining showed broad
variation across the different models and data sets. Forecasting efforts were
not successful early, but once the epidemic peak had been achieved, most models
showed similar accuracy. Our results suggest that we are unlikely to be able to
infer mechanistic details from epidemic case data alone, underscoring the need
for broader data collection. Nonetheless, with sufficient data, conclusions
from forecasting and some parameter estimates were robust to variations in the
model structure, and comparative modeling can help determine how variations in
model structure affect conclusions drawn from models and data.

1605.07052	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Genetic recombination as DNA repair	"  Maintenance of sexual reproduction and genetic recombination imposes
physiological costs when compared to parthenogenic reproduction, most
prominently: for maintaining the corresponding (molecular) machinery, for
finding a mating partner, and through the decreased fraction of females in a
population, which decreases the reproductive capacity. Based on principles from
information theory, we have previously developed a new population genetic
model, and applying it in simulations, we have recently hypothesized that all
species maintain the maximum genomic complexity that is required by their niche
and allowed by their mutation rate and selection intensity. Applying this idea
to the complexity overhead of recombination maintenance, its costs must be more
than compensated by an additional capacity for complexity in recombining
populations. Here, we show a simple mechanism, where recombination helps to
maintain larger biases of alleles frequencies in a population, so the
advantageous alleles can have increased frequency. This allows recombining
populations to maintain higher fitness and phenotypic efficiency in comparison
with asexual populations with the same parameters. Random mating alone already
significantly increases the ability to maintain genomic and phenotypic
complexity. Sexual selection provides additional capacity for this complexity.
The model can be considered as a unifying synthesis of previous hypotheses
about the roles of recombination in Muller's ratchet, mutation purging and Red

population frequencies of beneficial alleles and decreases detrimental ones. In

1605.07053	q-bio	q-bio.SC q-bio.QM	"The mitotic spindle in the one-cell C. elegans embryo is positioned with
  high precision and stability"	"  Precise positioning of the mitotic spindle is important for specifying the
plane of cell division, which in turn determines how the cytoplasmic contents
are partitioned into the daughter cells, and how the daughters are positioned
within the tissue. During metaphase in the early C. elegans embryo, the spindle
is aligned and centered on the anterior-posterior axis by a
microtubule-dependent machinery that exerts restoring forces when the spindle
is displaced from the center. To investigate the accuracy and stability of
centering, we tracked the position and orientation of the mitotic spindle
during the first cell division with high temporal and spatial resolution. We
found that the precision is remarkably high: the cell-to-cell variation in the
transverse position of the center of the spindle during metaphase, as measured
by the standard deviation, was only 1.5% of the length of the short axis of the
cell. Spindle position is also very stable: the standard deviation of the
fluctuations in transverse spindle position during metaphase was only 0.5% of
the short axis of the cell. Assuming that stability is limited by fluctuations
in the number of independent motor elements such as microtubules or dyneins
underlying the centering machinery, we infer that the number is on the order of
one thousand, consistent with the several thousand of astral microtubules in
these cells. Astral microtubules grow out from the two spindle poles, make
contact with the cell cortex, and then shrink back shortly thereafter. The high
stability of centering can be accounted for quantitatively if, while making
contact with the cortex, the astral microtubules buckle as they exert
compressive, pushing forces. We thus propose that the large number of
microtubules in the asters provides a highly precise mechanism for positioning
the spindle during metaphase while assembly is completed prior to the onset of
anaphase.

models in a principled, data-driven, and computationally efficient manner
continues to be one of the key challenges in high-dimensional statistics. We
present substantial computational gains and conceptual generalizations of the
Stability Approach to Regularization Selection (StARS), a state-of-the-art
graphical model selection scheme. Using properties of the Poisson-Binomial
distribution and convex non-asymptotic distributional modeling we propose lower
and upper bounds on the StARS graph regularization path which results in
greatly reduced computational cost without compromising regularization
selection. We also generalize the StARS criterion from single edge to induced
subgraph (graphlet) stability. We show that simultaneously requiring edge and
graphlet stability leads to superior graph recovery performance independent of
graph topology. These novel insights render Gaussian graphical model selection
a routine task on standard multi-core computers.

there is a lack of a systematic review of the possible effect of choosing
different initial conditions on the dynamic evolution of neural systems. In
this short review we intend to give insights into this topic by discussing some
published examples. First, we briefly introduce the different ingredients of a
neural dynamical model. Secondly, we introduce some concepts used to describe
the dynamic behavior of neural models, namely phase space and its portraits,
time series, spectra, multistability and bifurcations. We end with an analysis
of the irreversibility of processes and its implications on the functioning of
normal and pathological brains.

1605.07090	q-bio	cond-mat.soft physics.chem-ph q-bio.BM	How wet should be the reaction coordinate for ligand unbinding?	"  We use a recently proposed method called Spectral Gap Optimization of Order
Parameters (SGOOP) (Tiwary and Berne, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci 2016, 113, 2839
(2016)), to determine an optimal 1-dimensional reaction coordinate (RC) for the
unbinding of a bucky-ball from a pocket in explicit water. This RC is estimated
as a linear combination of the multiple available order parameters that
collectively can be used to distinguish the various stable states relevant for
unbinding. We pay special attention to determining and quantifying the degree
to which water molecules should be included in the RC. Using SGOOP with
under-sampled biased simulations, we predict that water plays a distinct role
in the reaction coordinate for unbinding in the case when the ligand is
sterically constrained to move along an axis of symmetry. This prediction is
validated through extensive calculations of the unbinding times through
metadynamics, and by comparison through detailed balance with unbiased
molecular dynamics estimate of the binding time. However when the steric
constraint is removed, we find that the role of water in the reaction
coordinate diminishes. Here instead SGOOP identifies a good one-dimensional RC
involving various motional degrees of freedom.

around the genome into a protective protein shell called the capsid, which can
take on a variety of shapes broadly classified as conical, cylindrical and
irregular. The majority of capsids seen in in vivo studies are conical in
shape, while in vitro experiments have shown a preference for cylindrical
capsids. The factors involved in the selection of the unique shape of HIV
capsids are not well understood, and in particular the impact of RNA on the
formation of the capsid is not known. In this work, we study the role of the
genome and its interaction with the capsid protein by modeling the genomic RNA
through a mean-field theory. Our results show that the confinement free energy
for a homopolymeric model genome confined in a conical capsid is lower than
that in a cylindrical capsid, at least when the genome does not interact with
the capsid, which seems to be the case in in vivo experiments. Conversely, the
confinement free energy for the cylinder is lower than for a conical capsid if
the genome is attracted to the capsid proteins as the in vitro experiments.
Understanding the factors that contribute to the formation of conical capsids
may shed light on the infectivity of HIV particles.

1605.07294	q-bio	q-bio.BM cond-mat.soft physics.bio-ph	"Directly measuring single molecule heterogeneity using force
  spectroscopy"	"  One of the most intriguing results of single molecule experiments on proteins
and nucleic acids is the discovery of functional heterogeneity: the observation
that complex cellular machines exhibit multiple, biologically active
conformations. The structural differences between these conformations may be
subtle, but each distinct state can be remarkably long-lived, with random
interconversions between states occurring only at macroscopic timescales,
fractions of a second or longer. Though we now have proof of functional
heterogeneity in a handful of systems---enzymes, motors, adhesion
complexes---identifying and measuring it remains a formidable challenge. Here
we show that evidence of this phenomenon is more widespread than previously
known, encoded in data collected from some of the most well-established single
molecule techniques: AFM or optical tweezer pulling experiments. We present a
theoretical procedure for analyzing distributions of rupture/unfolding forces
recorded at different pulling speeds. This results in a single parameter,
quantifying the degree of heterogeneity, and also leads to bounds on the
equilibration and conformational interconversion timescales. Surveying ten
published datasets, we find heterogeneity in five of them, all with
interconversion rates slower than 10 s$^{-1}$. Moreover, we identify two
systems where additional data at realizable pulling velocities is likely to
find a theoretically predicted, but so far unobserved cross-over regime between
heterogeneous and non-heterogeneous behavior. The significance of this regime
is that it will allow far more precise estimates of the slow conformational
switching times, one of the least understood aspects of functional
heterogeneity.

1605.07304	q-bio	q-bio.QM q-bio.MN	Modeling delayed processes in biological systems	"  Delayed processes are ubiquitous in biological systems and are often
characterized by delay differential equations (DDEs) and their extension to
include stochastic effects. DDEs do not explicitly incorporate intermediate
states associated with a delayed process but instead use an estimated average
delay time. In an effort to examine the validity of this approach, we study
systems with significant delays by explicitly incorporating intermediate steps.
We show by that such explicit models often yield significantly different
equilibrium distributions and transition times as compared to DDEs with
deterministic delay values. Additionally, different explicit models with
qualitatively different dynamics can give rise to the same DDEs revealing
important ambiguities. We also show that DDE-based predictions of oscillatory
behavior may fail for the corresponding explicit model.

1605.07371	q-bio	q-bio.NC cond-mat.stat-mech stat.ML	Semiparametric energy-based probabilistic models	"  Probabilistic models can be defined by an energy function, where the
probability of each state is proportional to the exponential of the state's
negative energy. This paper considers a generalization of energy-based models
in which the probability of a state is proportional to an arbitrary positive,
strictly decreasing, and twice differentiable function of the state's energy.
The precise shape of the nonlinear map from energies to unnormalized
probabilities has to be learned from data together with the parameters of the
energy function. As a case study we show that the above generalization of a
fully visible Boltzmann machine yields an accurate model of neural activity of
retinal ganglion cells. We attribute this success to the model's ability to
easily capture distributions whose probabilities span a large dynamic range, a
possible consequence of latent variables that globally couple the system.
Similar features have recently been observed in many datasets, suggesting that
our new method has wide applicability.

1605.07383	q-bio	q-bio.NC math.DS	"From Local Chaos to Critical Slowing Down: A Theory of the Functional
  Connectivity of Small Neural Circuits"	"  Functional connectivity is a fundamental property of neural networks that
quantifies the segregation and integration of information between cortical
areas. Due to mathematical complexity, a theory that could explain how the
parameters of mesoscopic networks composed of a few tens of neurons affect the
functional connectivity is still to be formulated. Yet, many interesting
problems in neuroscience involve the study of networks composed of a small
number of neurons. Based on a recent study of the dynamics of small neural
circuits, we combine the analysis of local bifurcations of multi-population
neural networks of arbitrary size with the analytical calculation of the
functional connectivity. We study the functional connectivity in different
regimes, showing that external stimuli cause the network to switch from
asynchronous states characterized by weak correlation and low variability
(local chaos), to synchronous states characterized by strong correlations and
wide temporal fluctuations (critical slowing down). Local chaos typically
occurs in large networks, but here we show that it can also be generated by
strong stimuli in small neural circuits. On the other side, critical slowing
down is expected to occur when the stimulus moves the network close to a local
bifurcation. In particular, strongly positive correlations occur at the
saddle-node and Andronov-Hopf bifurcations of the network, while strongly
negative correlations occur when the network undergoes a spontaneous
symmetry-breaking at the branching-point bifurcations. These results prove that
the functional connectivity of firing-rate network models is strongly affected
by the external stimuli even if the anatomical connections are fixed, and
suggest an effective mechanism through which biological networks can
dynamically modulate the encoding and integration of sensory information.

1605.07479	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Communities as cliques	"  High-diversity assemblages are very common in nature, and yet the factors
allowing for the maintenance of biodiversity remain obscure. The competitive
exclusion principle and May's complexity-diversity puzzle both suggest that a
community can support only a small number of species, turning the spotlight at
the dynamics of local patches or islands, where stable and uninvadable (SU)
subsets of species play a crucial role. Here we map the community SUs question
to the geometric problem of finding maximal cliques of the corresponding graph.
We solve for the number of SUs as a function of the species richness in the
regional pool, $N$, showing that this growth is subexponential, contrary to
long-standing wisdom. We show that symmetric systems relax rapidly to an SU,
where the system stays until a regime shift takes place. In asymmetric systems
the relaxation time grows much faster with $N$, suggesting an excitable
dynamics under noise.

1605.07488	q-bio	q-bio.GN	"Transcriptional Similarity in Couples Reveals the Impact of Shared
  Environment and Lifestyle on Gene Regulation through Modified Cytosines"	"  Gene expression is a complex and quantitative trait that is influenced by
both genetic and non-genetic regulators including environmental factors.
Evaluating the contribution of environment to gene expression regulation and
identifying which genes are more likely to be influenced by environmental
factors are important for understanding human complex traits. We hypothesize
that by living together as couples, there can be commonly co-regulated genes
that may reflect the shared living environment (e.g., diet, indoor air
pollutants, behavioral lifestyle). The lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived
from unrelated couples of African ancestry (YRI, Yoruba people from Ibadan,
Nigeria) from the International HapMap Project provided a unique model for us
to characterize gene expression pattern in couples by comparing gene expression
levels between husbands and wives. Strikingly, 778 genes were found to show
much smaller variances in couples than random pairs of individuals at a false
discovery rate (FDR) of 5%. Since genetic variation between unrelated family
members in a general population is expected to be the same assuming a
random-mating society, non-genetic factors (e.g., epigenetic systems) are more
likely to be the mediators for the observed transcriptional similarity in
couples. We thus evaluated the contribution of modified cytosines to those
genes showing transcriptional similarity in couples as well as the
relationships these CpG sites with other gene regulatory elements, such as
transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Our findings suggested that
transcriptional similarity in couples likely reflected shared common
environment partially mediated through cytosine modifications.

1605.07656	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Eco-evolutionary dynamics of social dilemmas	"  Social dilemmas are an integral part of social interactions. Cooperative
actions, ranging from secreting extra-cellular products in microbial
populations to donating blood in humans, are costly to the actor and hence
create an incentive to shirk and avoid the costs. Nevertheless, cooperation is
ubiquitous in nature. Both costs and benefits often depend non-linearly on the
number and types of individuals involved -- as captured by idioms such as `too
many cooks spoil the broth' where additional contributions are discounted, or
`two heads are better than one' where cooperators synergistically enhance the
group benefit. Interaction group sizes may depend on the size of the population
and hence on ecological processes. This results in feedback mechanisms between
ecological and evolutionary processes, which jointly affect and determine the
evolutionary trajectory. Only recently combined eco-evolutionary processes
became experimentally tractable in microbial social dilemmas. Here we analyse
the evolutionary dynamics of non-linear social dilemmas in settings where the
population fluctuates in size and the environment changes over time. In
particular, cooperation is often supported and maintained at high densities
through ecological fluctuations. Moreover, we find that the combination of the
two processes routinely reveals highly complex dynamics, which suggests common
occurrence in nature.

1605.07675	q-bio	q-bio.SC physics.bio-ph physics.data-an	Hybrid Markov-mass action law for cell activation by rare binding events	"  The binding of molecules, ions or proteins to specific target sites is a
generic step for cell activation. However, this step relies on rare events
where stochastic particles located in a large bulk are searching for small and
often hidden targets and thus remains difficult to study. We present here a
hybrid discrete-continuum model where the large ensemble of particles is
described by mass-action laws. The rare discrete binding events are modeled by
a Markov chain for the encounter of a finite number of small targets by few
Brownian particles, for which the arrival time is Poissonian. This model is
applied for predicting the time distribution of vesicular release at neuronal
synapses that remains elusive. This release is triggered by the binding of few
calcium ions that can originate either from the synaptic bulk or from the
transient entry through calcium channels. We report that the distribution of
release time is bimodal although triggered by a single fast action potential:
while the first peak follows a stimulation, the second corresponds to the
random arrival over much longer time of ions located in the bulk to small
binding targets. To conclude, the present multiscale stochastic chemical
reaction modeling allows studying cellular events based on integrating discrete
molecular events over various time scales.
"
1605.07690	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Games of multicellularity	"  Evolutionary game dynamics are often studied in the context of different
population structures. Here we propose a new population structure that is
inspired by simple multicellular life forms. In our model, cells reproduce but
can stay together after reproduction. They reach complexes of a certain size,
n, before producing single cells again. The cells within a complex derive
payoff from an evolutionary game by interacting with each other. The
reproductive rate of cells is proportional to their payoff. We consider all
two-strategy games. We study deterministic evolutionary dynamics with
mutations, and derive exact conditions for selection to favor one strategy over
another. Our main result has the same symmetry as the well-known sigma
condition, which has been proven for stochastic game dynamics and weak
selection. For a maximum complex size of n=2 our result holds for any intensity
of selection. For n > 2 it holds for weak selection. As specific examples we
study the prisoner's dilemma and hawk-dove games. Our model advances
theoretical work on multicellularity by allowing for frequency-dependent
interactions within groups.

Markov State Model (MSM) with perturbed equilibrium populations, given
estimates of state populations and rates for an unperturbed MSM. It is similar
in spirit to previous approaches but given the inclusion of prior information
it is more robust and simple to implement. We examine its performance in simple
biased diffusion models of kinetics, and then apply the method to predicting
changes in folding rates for several highly non-trivial protein folding systems
for which non-native interactions play a significant role, including (1)
tryptophan variants of GB1 hairpin, (2) salt-bridge mutations of Fs peptide
helix, and (3) MSMs built from ultra-long folding trajectories of FiP35 and GTT
variants of WW domain. In all cases, the method correctly predicts changes in
folding rates, suggesting the wide applicability of maximum-caliber approaches
to efficiently predict how mutations perturb protein conformational dynamics.

topoisomerases in bacteria by stabilising the normally transient double strand

we discuss the development of these antibiotics and their method of action.
Existing methods for DNA damage visualisation, such as the comet assay and
immunofluorescence imaging can often only be analysed qualitatively and this
analysis is subjective. We describe a putative single-molecule fluorescence
technique for quantifying DNA damage via the total fluorescence intensity of a
DNA origami tile fully saturated with an intercalating dye, along with the
optical requirements for how to implement these into a light microscopy imaging
system capable of single-molecule millisecond timescale imaging. This system

instrumental design tailored to the biological system in question translates
into the functionality suitable for that particular study. The unique insights

metronidazole causes single and double stranded breaks in DNA. To understand
how bacteria respond to these drugs, it is important to understand the repair
processes utilised when DNA replication is blocked. We have used tandem lac
operators inserted into the chromosome bound by fluorescently labelled lac
repressors as a model protein block to replication in E. coli. We have used
dual-colour, alternating-laser, single-molecule narrowfield microscopy to

eukaryotic, yeast cells, which contain sub-cellular compartments. We describe
how to obtain single-molecule microscopy data but also how to analyse these
data to track and obtain the stoichiometry of molecular complexes diffusing in
the cell. We chose glucose mediated signal transduction of live yeast cells as
the system to demonstrate these single-molecule techniques as transcriptional

of oscillations are well understood in low-dimensional systems, but have not
been fully explored in high-dimensional networks. Here we study large networks
consisting of randomly coupled rate units. We identify a novel type of
bifurcation in which a continuous part of the eigenvalue spectrum of the linear
stability matrix crosses the instability line at non-zero-frequency. This
bifurcation occurs when the interactions are delayed and partially
anti-symmetric, and leads to a heterogeneous oscillatory state in which
oscillations are apparent in the activity of individual units, but not on the

regions of pre-mRNAs are differentially joined in order to form different
transcript isoforms. Alternative splicing is involved in the regulation of
normal physiological functions but also linked to the development of diseases
such as cancer. We analyse differential expression and splicing using RNA-seq
time series in three different settings: overall gene expression levels,
absolute transcript expression levels and relative transcript expression
levels.
  Results: Using estrogen receptor $\alpha$ signalling response as a model
system, our Gaussian process (GP)-based test identifies genes with differential
splicing and/or differentially expressed transcripts. We discover genes with
consistent changes in alternative splicing independent of changes in absolute
expression and genes where some transcripts change while others stay constant
in absolute level. The results suggest classes of genes with different modes of
alternative splicing regulation during the experiment.

  nonnegative spline regression"	"  Whole-brain neural connectivity data are now available from viral tracing
experiments, which reveal the connections between a source injection site and
elsewhere in the brain. These hold the promise of revealing spatial patterns of
connectivity throughout the mammalian brain. To achieve this goal, we seek to
fit a weighted, nonnegative adjacency matrix among 100 $\mu$m brain ""voxels""
using viral tracer data. Despite a multi-year experimental effort, injections
provide incomplete coverage, and the number of voxels in our data is orders of
magnitude larger than the number of injections, making the problem severely
underdetermined. Furthermore, projection data are missing within the injection
site because local connections there are not separable from the injection
signal.
  We use a novel machine-learning algorithm to meet these challenges and
develop a spatially explicit, voxel-scale connectivity map of the mouse visual
system. Our method combines three features: a matrix completion loss for
missing data, a smoothing spline penalty to regularize the problem, and
(optionally) a low rank factorization. We demonstrate the consistency of our
estimator using synthetic data and then apply it to newly available Allen Mouse
Brain Connectivity Atlas data for the visual system. Our algorithm is
significantly more predictive than current state of the art approaches which
assume regions to be homogeneous. We demonstrate the efficacy of a low rank
version on visual cortex data and discuss the possibility of extending this to
a whole-brain connectivity matrix at the voxel scale.

  classification"	"  Several experimental studies claim to be able to predict the outcome of
simple decisions from brain signals measured before subjects are aware of their
decision. Often, these studies use multivariate pattern recognition methods
with the underlying assumption that the ability to classify the brain signal is
equivalent to predict the decision itself. Here we show instead that it is
possible to correctly classify a signal even if it does not contain any
predictive information about the decision. We first define a simple stochastic
model that mimics the random decision process between two equivalent
alternatives, and generate a large number of independent trials that contain no
choice-predictive information. The trials are first time-locked to the time
point of the final event and then classified using standard machine-learning
techniques. The resulting classification accuracy is above chance level long
before the time point of time-locking. We then analyze the same trials using
information theory. We demonstrate that the high classification accuracy is a
consequence of time-locking and that its time behavior is simply related to the
large relaxation time of the process. We conclude that when time-locking is a
crucial step in the analysis of neural activity patterns, both the emergence
and the timing of the classification accuracy are affected by structural
properties of the network that generates the signal.

non-planar elastic substrates. Soft elastic substrates with a wave-like
topology were micromolded from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and fluorescent
marker beads were distributed homogeneously in the substrate. Using feature
vector based tracking of these marker beads, we first constructed a hexahedral
mesh for the substrate. We then solved the direct elastic boundary volume
problem on this mesh using the finite element method (FEM). Using data
simulations, we show that the traction forces can be reconstructed from the
substrate deformations by solving the corresponding inverse problem with a
L1-norm for the residue and a L2-norm for 0th order Tikhonov regularization.
Applying this procedure to the experimental data, we find that cardiac
myofibroblast cells tend to align both their shapes and their forces with the
long axis of the deformable wavy substrate.

1605.08454	q-bio	q-bio.NC stat.ML	Linear dynamical neural population models through nonlinear embeddings	"  A body of recent work in modeling neural activity focuses on recovering
low-dimensional latent features that capture the statistical structure of
large-scale neural populations. Most such approaches have focused on linear
generative models, where inference is computationally tractable. Here, we
propose fLDS, a general class of nonlinear generative models that permits the
firing rate of each neuron to vary as an arbitrary smooth function of a latent,
linear dynamical state. This extra flexibility allows the model to capture a
richer set of neural variability than a purely linear model, but retains an
easily visualizable low-dimensional latent space. To fit this class of
non-conjugate models we propose a variational inference scheme, along with a
novel approximate posterior capable of capturing rich temporal correlations
across time. We show that our techniques permit inference in a wide class of
generative models.We also show in application to two neural datasets that,
compared to state-of-the-art neural population models, fLDS captures a much
larger proportion of neural variability with a small number of latent
dimensions, providing superior predictive performance and interpretability.

1605.08474	q-bio	math.CA math.DS q-bio.GN	Dynamics of transcription-translation networks	"  A theory for qualitative models of gene regulatory networks has been
developed over several decades, generally considering transcription factors to
regulate directly the expression of other transcription factors, without any
intermediate variables. Here we explore a class of models that explicitly
includes both transcription and translation, keeping track of both mRNA and
protein concentrations. We mainly deal with transcription regulation functions
that are steep sigmoids or step functions, as is often done in protein-only
models, though translation is governed by a linear term. We extend many aspects
of the protein-only theory to this new context, including properties of fixed
points, description of trajectories by mappings between switching points,
qualitative analysis via a state-transition diagram, and a result on periodic
orbits for negative feedback loops. We find that while singular behaviour in
switching domains is largely avoided, non-uniqueness of solutions can still
occur in the step-function limit.

underlies evolutionary processes from the emergence of cells to eusociality and
the economics of nations. Previous studies on multilevel selection assumed that
the effective higher-level selection emerges from lower-level reproduction.
This leads to selection among groups, although only individuals reproduce. We
introduce selective group extinction, where groups die with a probability
inversely proportional to their group fitness. When accounting for this the
critical benefit-to-cost ratio is substantially lowered. Because in game theory
and evolutionary dynamics the degree of cooperation crucially depends on this
ratio above which cooperation emerges previous studies may have substantially
underestimated the establishment and maintenance of cooperation.

thermodynamic quantities from single molecule time traces. SMACKS (Single
Molecule Analysis of Complex Kinetic Sequences) is a maximum likelihood
approach that works equally well for long trajectories as for a set of short
ones. It resolves all statistically relevant rates and also their
uncertainties. This is achieved by optimizing one global kinetic model based on
the complete dataset, while allowing for experimental variations between
individual trajectories. In particular, neither a priori models nor equilibrium
have to be assumed. The power of SMACKS is demonstrated on the kinetics of the
multi-domain protein Hsp90 measured by smFRET (single molecule F\""orster
resonance energy transfer). Experiments in and out of equilibrium are analyzed
and compared to simulations, shedding new light on the role of Hsp90's ATPase
function. SMACKS pushes the boundaries of single molecule kinetics far beyond
current methods.

often analyze multiple GWASs with the same phenotype together to discover
associated genetic variants with higher power. Since it is difficult to access
data with detailed individual measurements, summary-statistics-based
meta-analysis methods have become popular to jointly analyze data sets from
multiple GWASs. In this paper, we propose a novel summary-statistics-based
joint analysis method based on controlling the joint local false discovery rate
(Jlfdr). We prove that our method is the most powerful summary-statistics-based
joint analysis method when controlling the false discovery rate at a certain
level. In particular, the Jlfdr-based method achieves higher power than
commonly used meta-analysis methods when analyzing heterogeneous data sets from
multiple GWASs. Simulation experiments demonstrate the superior power of our
method over meta-analysis methods. Also, our method discovers more associations
than meta-analysis methods from empirical data sets of four phenotypes. The
R-package is available at: http://bioinformatics.ust.hk/Jlfdr.html.

1605.08909	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Response statistics dissect the contributions of different sources of
  variability to population activity in V1"	"  Response variability, as measured by fluctuating responses upon repeated
performance of trials, is a major component of neural responses, and its
characterization is key to interpret high dimensional population recordings.
Response variability and covariability display predictable changes upon changes
in stimulus and cognitive or behavioral state, providing an opportunity to test
the predictive power of models of neural variability. Still, there is little
agreement on which model to use as a building block for population-level
analyses, and models of variability are often treated as a subject of choice.
We investigate two competing models, the Doubly Stochastic Poisson (DSP) model
assuming stochasticity at spike generation, and the Rectified Gaussian (RG)
model that traces variability back to membrane potential variance, to analyze
stimulus-dependent modulation of response statistics. Using a model of a pair
of neurons, we demonstrate that the two models predict similar single-cell
statistics. However, DSP and RG models have contradicting predictions on the
joint statistics of spiking responses. In order to test the models against
data, we build a population model to simulate stimulus change-related
modulations in response statistics. We use unit recordings from the primary
visual cortex of monkeys to show that while model predictions for variance are
qualitatively similar to experimental data, only the RG model's predictions are
compatible with joint statistics. These results suggest that models using
Poisson-like variability might fail to capture important properties of response
statistics. We argue that membrane potential-level modelling of stochasticity
provides an efficient strategy to model correlations.

disordered proteins (IDPs) is critical in the biological function of
membraneless organelles. Much of the physics of this recent discovery remains
to be elucidated. Here we present a theory in the random phase approximation to
account for electrostatic effects in polyampholyte phase separations, yielding
predictions consistent with recent experiments on the IDP Ddx4. The theory is
applicable to any charge pattern and thus provides a general analytical
framework for studying sequence dependence of IDP phase separation.

1605.09020	q-bio	q-bio.MN physics.chem-ph q-bio.QM	Michaelis-Menten dynamics in protein subnetworks	"  To understand the behaviour of complex systems it is often necessary to use
models that describe the dynamics of subnetworks. It has previously been
established using projection methods that such subnetwork dynamics generically
involves memory of the past, and that the memory functions can be calculated
explicitly for biochemical reaction networks made up of unary and binary
reactions. However, many established network models involve also
Michaelis-Menten kinetics, to describe e.g. enzymatic reactions. We show that
the projection approach to subnetwork dynamics can be extended to such
networks, thus significantly broadening its range of applicability. To derive
the extension we construct a larger network that represents enzymes and enzyme
complexes explicitly, obtain the projected equations, and finally take the
limit of fast enzyme reactions that gives back Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The
crucial point is that this limit can be taken in closed form. The outcome is a
simple procedure that allows one to obtain a description of subnetwork
dynamics, including memory functions, starting directly from any given network
of unary, binary and Michaelis-Menten reactions. Numerical tests show that this
closed form enzyme elimination gives a much more accurate description of the
subnetwork dynamics than the simpler method that represents enzymes explicitly,
and is also more efficient computationally.

1605.09023	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Motor control by precisely timed spike patterns	"  A fundamental problem in neuroscience is to understand how sequences of
action potentials (""spikes"") encode information about sensory signals and motor
outputs. Although traditional theories of neural coding assume that information
is conveyed by the total number of spikes fired (spike rate), recent studies of
sensory and motor activity have shown that far more information is carried by
the millisecond-scale timing patterns of action potentials (spike timing).
However, it is unknown whether or how subtle differences in spike timing drive
differences in perception or behavior, leaving it unclear whether the
information carried by spike timing actually plays a causal role in brain
function. Here we demonstrate how a precise spike timing code is read out
downstream by the muscles to control behavior. We provide both correlative and
causal evidence to show that the nervous system uses millisecond-scale
variations in the timing of spikes within multi-spike patterns to regulate a
relatively simple behavior - respiration in the Bengalese finch, a songbird.
These findings suggest that a fundamental assumption of current theories of
motor coding requires revision, and that significant improvements in
applications, such as neural prosthetic devices, can be achieved by using
precise spike timing information.

1605.09070	q-bio	q-bio.GN	"Dynamic read mapping and online consensus calling for better variant
  detection"	"  Variant detection from high-throughput sequencing data is an essential step
in identification of alleles involved in complex diseases and cancer. To deal
with these massive data, elaborated sequence analysis pipelines are employed. A
core component of such pipelines is a read mapping module whose accuracy
strongly affects the quality of resulting variant calls.
  We propose a dynamic read mapping approach that significantly improves read
alignment accuracy. The general idea of dynamic mapping is to continuously
update the reference sequence on the basis of previously computed read
alignments. Even though this concept already appeared in the literature, we
believe that our work provides the first comprehensive analysis of this
approach.
  To evaluate the benefit of dynamic mapping, we developed a software pipeline
(http://github.com/karel-brinda/dymas) that mimics different dynamic mapping
scenarios. The pipeline was applied to compare dynamic mapping with the
conventional static mapping and, on the other hand, with the so-called
iterative referencing - a computationally expensive procedure computing an
optimal modification of the reference that maximizes the overall quality of all
alignments. We conclude that in all alternatives, dynamic mapping results in a
much better accuracy than static mapping, approaching the accuracy of iterative
referencing.
  To correct the reference sequence in the course of dynamic mapping, we
developed an online consensus caller named OCOCO
(http://github.com/karel-brinda/ococo). OCOCO is the first consensus caller
capable to process input reads in the online fashion.
  Finally, we provide conclusions about the feasibility of dynamic mapping and
discuss main obstacles that have to be overcome to implement it. We also review
a wide range of possible applications of dynamic mapping with a special
emphasis on variant detection.

  networks"	"  How does the connectivity of a network system combine with the behavior of
its individual components to determine its collective function? We approach
this question by relating the internal network feedback to the statistical
prevalence of connectivity motifs, a set of surprisingly simple and local
statistics on the network topology. The resulting motif description provides a
reduced order model of the network input-output dynamics and it relates the
overall network function to feedback control theory. For example, this new
formulation dramatically simplifies the classic Erdos-Renyi graph, reducing the
overall graph behavior to a simple proportional feedback wrapped around the
dynamics of a single node. Higher-order motifs systematically provide further
layers and types of feedback to regulate the network response. Thus, the local
connectivity shapes temporal and spectral processing by the network as a whole,
and we show how this enables robust, yet tunable, functionality such as
extending the time constant with which networks remember past signals. Rich
connections between structure and function are developed for networks with
random input and output weights, and those composed from nodes with distinct
dynamics and connectivity. These simple statistical descriptions provide a
powerful theoretical framework to understand the functionality of real-world
network systems, as we illustrate for the mouse brain connectome.

By considering a large self interaction $u$, we conduct a perturbative
expansion which manifests that the nature of the interactions has a direct
impact on the species abundance distribution. The central results are all
species coexistence in a realistic range of the model parameters and that a
certain discrete nature of the interactions induces multiple peaks in the
species abundance distribution, providing the possibility of theoretically
explaining multiple peaks observed in various field studies. To get more
quantitative information, we also construct a non-perturbative theory which
becomes exact on tree-like networks if all the species coexist, providing exact
critical values of $u$ below which extinct species emerge. Numerical
simulations in various different situations are conducted and they clarify the
robustness of the presented mechanism of all species coexistence and multiple
peaks in the species abundance distributions.

  Specific Target Areas on the Plasma Membrane of Spherical Cells"	"  Intracellular transport is vital for the proper functioning and survival of a
cell. Cargo (proteins, vesicles, organelles, etc.) is transferred from its
place of creation to its target locations via molecular motor assisted
transport along cytoskeletal filaments. The transport efficiency is strongly
affected by the spatial organization of the cytoskeleton, which constitutes an
inhomogeneous, complex network. In cells with a centrosome microtubules grow
radially from the central microtubule organizing center towards the cell
periphery whereas actin filaments form a dense meshwork, the actin cortex,
underneath the cell membrane with a broad range of orientations. The emerging
ballistic motion along filaments is frequently interrupted due to constricting
intersection nodes or cycles of detachment and reattachment processes in the
crowded cytoplasm. In order to investigate the efficiency of search strategies
established by the cell's specific spatial organization of the cytoskeleton we
formulate a random velocity model with intermittent arrest states. With
extensive computer simulations we analyze the dependence of the mean first
passage times for narrow escape problems on the structural characteristics of
the cytoskeleton, the motor properties and the fraction of time spent in each
state. We find that an inhomogeneous architecture with a small width of the
actin cortex constitutes an efficient intracellular search strategy.

  using CABS-dock"	"  The protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are crucial for understanding the
majority of cellular processes. PPIs play important role in gene transcription
regulation, cellular signaling, molecular basis of immune response and more.
Moreover, a disruption of hese mechanisms is frequently postulated as a
possible cause of diseases such as Alzheimer's or cancer. For many of
biologically relevant cases the structure of protein-protein complexes remain
unknown. Therefore computational techniques, including molecular docking, have
become a valuable part of drug discovery pipelines. Unfortunately, none of the
widely used protein-protein docking tools is free from serious limitations.
Typically, in docking simulations the protein flexibility is either completely
neglected or very limited. Additionally, some knowledge of the approximate
location and/or the shape of the active site is also required. Such limitations
arise mostly from the enormous number of degrees of freedom of protein-protein
systems. In this paper, an efficient computational method for protein-protein
docking is proposed and initially tested on a single docking case. The proposed
method is based on a two-step procedure. In the first step, CABS-dock web
server for protein-peptide docking is used to dock a peptide, which is the
appropriate protein fragment responsible for the protein-protein interaction,
to the other protein partner. During peptide docking, no knowledge about the
binding site, nor the peptide structure, is used and the peptide is allowed to
be fully flexible. In the second step, the docked peptide is used in the
structural adjustment of protein complex partners. The proposed method allowed
us to obtain a high accuracy model, therefore it provides a promising framework
for further advances.

  the binding site"	"  Despite considerable efforts, structural prediction of protein-peptide
complexes is still a very challenging task, mainly due to two reasons: high
flexibility of the peptides and transient character of their interactions with
proteins. Recently we have developed an automated web server CABS-dock
(http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/CABSdock), which conducts flexible
protein-peptide docking without any knowledge about the binding site. Our
method allows for full flexibility of the peptide, whereas the flexibility of
the receptor is restricted to near native conformations considering the main
chain, and full flexibility of the side chains. Performance of the CABS-dock
server was thoroughly tested on a benchmark of 171 test cases, both bound and
unbound. Evaluation of the obtained results showed overall good performance of
the method, especially that no information of the binding site was used. From
unsuccessful experiments we learned that the accuracy of docking might be
significantly improved, if only little information of the binding site was
considered. In fact, in real-life applications user typically has access to
some data indicating the location and/or structure of the binding site. In the
current work, we test and demonstrate the performance of the CABS-dock server
with two new features. The first one allows to utilize the knowledge about
receptor residue(s) constituting the binding site, and the second one allows to
enforce the desired secondary structure on the peptide structure. Based on the
given example, we observe significant improvement of the docking accuracy in
comparison to the default CABS-dock mode.

  and Atypical Brain Activity"	"  Scale-free networks (SFN) arise from simple growth processes, which can
encourage efficient, centralized and fault tolerant communication (1). Recently
its been shown that stable network hub structure is governed by a phase
transition at exponents (>2.0) causing a dramatic change in network structure
including a loss of global connectivity, an increasing minimum dominating node
set, and a shift towards increasing connectivity growth compared to node
growth. Is this SFN shift identifiable in atypical brain activity? The Pareto
Distribution (P(D)~D^-\b{eta}) on the hub Degree (D) is a signature of
scale-free networks. During resting-state, we assess Degree exponents across a
large range of neurotypical and atypical subjects. We use graph complexity
theory to provide a predictive theory of the brain network structure. Results.
We show that neurotypical resting-state fMRI brain activity possess scale-free
Pareto exponents (1.8 se .01) in a single individual scanned over 66 days as
well as in 60 different individuals (1.8 se .02). We also show that 60
individuals with Autistic Spectrum Disorder, and 60 individuals with
Schizophrenia have significantly higher (>2.0) scale-free exponents (2.4 se
.03, 2.3 se .04), indicating more fractionated and less controllable dynamics
in the brain networks revealed in resting state. Finally we show that the
exponent values vary with phenotypic measures of atypical disease severity
indicating that the global topology of the network itself can provide specific
diagnostic biomarkers for atypical brain activity.

clinical DBS treatment for neurological movement disorders, but control
algorithms may perform differently across patients. New metrics are needed for
comparing and evaluating closed-loop algorithm performance that address the
specific needs of closed-loop neuromodulation controllers. Approach: A metric
is proposed for system performance that includes normalized terms that can be
used to compare algorithm performance for a patient. This metric was evaluated
using two closed-loop control algorithms that were tested in patients with
Parkinson's Disease (PD) who experience rest tremor. Main Results: The metric's
resulting balance between tremor treatment and power savings varied on a per
patient and algorithm basis. This was expected given how each trial resulted in
a variable reduction in stimulation power at the cost of additional tremor for
the patient when compared to open-loop stimulation. Significance: The proposed
metric will aid in clinical evaluation of new algorithms and provide a
benchmark for future system designers. This will be important given the growing
potential applications of dynamically adjusted neural stimulation.

systems. For example, in neuroscience, bursting is believed to play a key role
in the way information is transferred in the nervous system. In this work, we
propose a model that, appropriately tuned, can display several types of
bursting behaviors. The model contains two subsystems acting at different
timescales. For the fast subsystem we use the planar unfolding of a high
codimension singularity. In its bifurcation diagram, we locate paths that
underly the right sequence of bifurcations necessary for bursting. The slow
subsystem steers the fast one back and forth along these paths leading to
bursting behavior. The model is able to produce almost all the classes of
bursting predicted for systems with a planar fast subsystems. Transitions
between classes can be obtained through an ultra-slow modulation of the model's
parameters. A detailed exploration of the parameter space allows predicting
possible transitions. This provides a single framework to understand the
coexistence of diverse bursting patterns in physical and biological systems or
in models.

  presence of traps"	"  The speed of site-specific binding of transcription factor (TFs) proteins
with genomic DNA seems to be strongly retarded by the randomly occurring
sequence traps. Traps are those DNA sequences sharing significant similarity
with the original specific binding sites. It is an intriguing question how the
naturally occurring TFs and their specific binding sites are designed to manage
the retarding effects of such randomly occurring traps. We develop a simple
random walk model on the site-specific binding of TFs with genomic DNA in the
presence of sequence traps. Our dynamical model predicts that (a) the retarding
effects of traps will be minimum when the traps are arranged around the
specific binding site such that there is a negative correlation between the
binding strength of TFs with traps and the distance of traps from the specific
binding site and (b) the retarding effects of sequence traps can be appeased by
the condensed conformational state of DNA. Our computational analysis results
on the distribution of sequence traps around the putative binding sites of
various TFs in mouse and human genome clearly agree well the theoretical
predictions. We propose that the distribution of traps can be used as an
additional metric to efficiently identify the specific binding sites of TFs on
genomic DNA.

  diseases from multiplex comorbidity networks"	"  Most disorders are caused by a combination of multiple genetic and/or
environmental factors. If two diseases are caused by the same molecular
mechanism, they tend to co-occur in patients. Here we provide a quantitative
method to disentangle how much genetic or environmental risk factors contribute
to the pathogenesis of 358 individual diseases, respectively. We pool data on
genetic, pathway-based, and toxicogenomic disease-causing mechanisms with
disease co-occurrence data obtained from almost two million patients. From this
data we construct a multilayer network where nodes represent disorders that are
connected by links that either represent phenotypic comorbidity of the patients
or the involvement of a certain molecular mechanism. From the similarity of
phenotypic and mechanism-based networks for each disorder we derive measure
that allows us to quantify the relative importance of various molecular
mechanisms for a given disease. We find that most diseases are dominated by
genetic risk factors, while environmental influences prevail for disorders such
as depressions, cancers, or dermatitis. Almost never we find that more than one
type of mechanisms is involved in the pathogenesis of diseases.

about the scales and conditions at which biotic interactions matter and their
interplay with the environment to structure species assemblages. Here we
develop ecological theory to analyze plant distribution and trait data across
Europe and find that plant height clustering is related to evapotranspiration
and gross primary productivity. Our analysis suggests competitive dominance as
a plausible mechanism underlying community assembly patterns over these
continental scales. In particular, we find a clear signal of plant-to-plant
competition in mid-latitude ecoregions, where conditions for growth (reflected
in actual evapotranspiration rates and gross primary productivities) are
optimal. Under severe conditions, either climate is too harsh and overrides the
effect of competition or other interactions play a relevant role. Our approach

peptide-major-histocompatibility-complex pMHC immunological synapse bond. The
key question addressed here is the following: how does a synapse bond remain
stabilized in the presence of high frequency thermal noise that potentially
equates to a strong detaching force? Focusing on the average time persistence
of an immature synapse, we show that the high frequency nodes accompanying
large fluctuations are counterbalanced by low frequency nodes that evolve over
longer time periods. Our analysis shows that such a behavior could be easily
explained from the fact that the survival probability distribution is governed
by two distinct phases, for the two different time regimes. The relatively
shorter time scales correspond to the cohesion:adhesion induced immature bond
formation whereas the larger time reciprocates the association:dissociation
regime leading to TCR:pMHC signaling. From an estimation of the bond survival
probability, we show that at shorter time scales, this probability
$P_{\Delta}(\tau)$ scales with time $\tau$ as an universal function of a
rescaled noise amplitude $\frac{D}{\Delta^2}$, such that $P_{\Delta}(\tau)\sim
\tau^{-(\frac{\Delta}{\sqrt{D}}+\frac{1}{2})}$, $\Delta$ being the distance
from the mean inter-membrane (T cell:Antigen Presenting Cell) separation
distance. The crossover from this shorter to a longer time regime leads to an
universality in the dynamics, at which point the survival probability shows a
different power-law scaling compared to the one at shorter time scales. In
biological terms, such a crossover indicates that the TCR:pMHC bond has a
survival probability with a slower decay rate than the longer LFA-1:ICAM-1 bond
justifying its stability.

  bond-to-bond propensities"	"  Allosteric regulation is central to many biochemical processes. Allosteric
sites provide a target to fine-tune protein activity, yet we lack computational
methods to predict them. Here, we present an efficient graph-theoretical
approach for identifying allosteric sites and the mediating interactions that
connect them to the active site. Using an atomistic graph with edges weighted
by covalent and non-covalent bond energies, we obtain a bond-to-bond propensity
that quantifies the effect of instantaneous bond fluctuations propagating
through the protein. We use this propensity to detect the sites and
communication pathways most strongly linked to the active site, assessing their
significance through quantile regression and comparison against a reference set
of 100 generic proteins. We exemplify our method in detail with three
well-studied allosteric proteins: caspase-1, CheY, and h-Ras, correctly
predicting the location of the allosteric site and identifying key allosteric
interactions. Consistent prediction of allosteric sites is then attained in a
further set of 17 proteins known to exhibit allostery. Because our propensity
measure runs in almost linear time, it offers a scalable approach to
high-throughput searches for candidate allosteric sites.

1605.09713	q-bio	q-bio.CB	Mechanics and polarity in cell motility	"  The motility of a fish keratocyte on a flat substrate exhibits two distinct
regimes: the non-migrating and the migrating one. In both configurations the
shape is fixed in time and, when the cell is moving, the velocity is constant
in magnitude and direction. Transition from a stable configuration to the other
one can be produced by a mechanical or chemotactic perturbation. In order to
point out the mechanical nature of such a bistable behaviour, we focus on the
actin dynamics inside the cell using a minimal mathematical model. While the
protein diffusion, recruitment and segregation govern the polarization process,
we show that the free actin mass balance, driven by diffusion, and the
polymerized actin retrograde flow, regulated by the active stress, are
sufficient ingredients to account for the motile bistability. The length and
velocity of the cell are predicted on the basis of the parameters of the
substrate and of the cell itself. The key physical ingredient of the theory is
the exchange among actin phases at the edges of the cell, that plays a central
role both in kinematics and in dynamics.

computing both 1 and 2-dimensional Persistent Betti Numbers functions related
to the ABCDE parameters and to the internal texture of the lesion. The results

  model"	"  Linear-nonlinear transforms are interesting in vision science because they
are key in modeling a number of perceptual experiences such as color, motion or
spatial texture. Here we first show that a number of issues in vision may be
addressed through an analytic expression of the Jacobian of these
linear-nonlinear transforms. The particular model analyzed afterwards (an
extension of [Malo & Simoncelli SPIE 2015]) is illustrative because it consists
of a cascade of standard linear-nonlinear modules. Each module roughly
corresponds to a known psychophysical mechanism: (1) linear spectral
integration and nonlinear brightness-from-luminance computation, (2) linear
pooling of local brightness and nonlinear normalization for local contrast
computation, (3) linear frequency selectivity and nonlinear normalization for
spatial contrast masking, and (4) linear wavelet-like decomposition and
nonlinear normalization for frequency-dependent masking. Beyond being the
appropriate technical report with the missing details in [Malo & Simoncelli
SPIE 2015], the interest of the presented analytic results and numerical
methods transcend the particular model because of the ubiquity of the
linear-nonlinear structure. Part of this material was presented at MODVIS 2016

1606.00235	q-bio	astro-ph.IM math.ST q-bio.QM stat.ML stat.TH	Clustering with phylogenetic tools in astrophysics	"  Phylogenetic approaches are finding more and more applications outside the
field of biology. Astrophysics is no exception since an overwhelming amount of
multivariate data has appeared in the last twenty years or so. In particular,
the diversification of galaxies throughout the evolution of the Universe quite
naturally invokes phylogenetic approaches. We have demonstrated that Maximum
Parsimony brings useful astrophysical results, and we now proceed toward the
analyses of large datasets for galaxies. In this talk I present how we solve
the major difficulties for this goal: the choice of the parameters, their
discretization, and the analysis of a high number of objects with an
unsupervised NP-hard classification technique like cladistics. 1. Introduction
How do the galaxy form, and when? How did the galaxy evolve and transform
themselves to create the diversity we observe? What are the progenitors to
present-day galaxies? To answer these big questions, observations throughout
the Universe and the physical modelisation are obvious tools. But between
these, there is a key process, without which it would be impossible to extract
some digestible information from the complexity of these systems. This is
classification. One century ago, galaxies were discovered by Hubble. From
images obtained in the visible range of wavelengths, he synthetised his
observations through the usual process: classification. With only one parameter
(the shape) that is qualitative and determined with the eye, he found four
categories: ellipticals, spirals, barred spirals and irregulars. This is the
famous Hubble classification. He later hypothetized relationships between these
classes, building the Hubble Tuning Fork. The Hubble classification has been
refined, notably by de Vaucouleurs, and is still used as the only global
classification of galaxies. Even though the physical relationships proposed by
Hubble are not retained any more, the Hubble Tuning Fork is nearly always used
to represent the classification of the galaxy diversity under its new name the
Hubble sequence (e.g. Delgado-Serrano, 2012). Its success is impressive and can
be understood by its simplicity, even its beauty, and by the many correlations
found between the morphology of galaxies and their other properties. And one
must admit that there is no alternative up to now, even though both the Hubble
classification and diagram have been recognised to be unsatisfactory. Among the
most obvious flaws of this classification, one must mention its monovariate,
qualitative, subjective and old-fashioned nature, as well as the difficulty to
characterise the morphology of distant galaxies. The first two most significant
multivariate studies were by Watanabe et al. (1985) and Whitmore (1984). Since
the year 2005, the number of studies attempting to go beyond the Hubble
classification has increased largely. Why, despite of this, the Hubble
classification and its sequence are still alive and no alternative have yet
emerged (Sandage, 2005)? My feeling is that the results of the multivariate
analyses are not easily integrated into a one-century old practice of modeling
the observations. In addition, extragalactic objects like galaxies, stellar
clusters or stars do evolve. Astronomy now provides data on very distant
objects, raising the question of the relationships between those and our
present day nearby galaxies. Clearly, this is a phylogenetic problem.
Astrocladistics 1 aims at exploring the use of phylogenetic tools in
astrophysics (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2006a,b). We have proved that Maximum
Parsimony (or cladistics) can be applied in astrophysics and provides a new
exploration tool of the data (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2009, 2012, Cardone \&
Fraix-Burnet, 2013). As far as the classification of galaxies is concerned, a
larger number of objects must now be analysed. In this paper, I

very frequently used to determine fatigue. However, as RMS is also influenced
by muscle force,its effective usage as indicator of fatigue is mainly limited
to isometric, constant force tasks.This research develops a simple me-thodto
preclude the effect of muscle force, hereby estimates the EMG amplitude
response exclusively to fatigue with RMS. Experiment was carried out on the
biceps brachiis of 15 subjects (7males, 8 females) during sustained static
maximum voluntary contractions (sMVC).Result shows that the sEMG RMS response
to fatigue increasesto 21.27% while muscle force decreasing to 50%MVC, which
implies that more and more extra effort is needed as muscle fatigue
intensifies. It would be promising to use the RMS response exclusively to
fatigue as an indicator of muscle fatigue.

ions in brain liquid. This liquid contains vast areas of the fourth phase of
water with hexagonal packing of its molecules, the so-called exclusion zone
(EZ) of water. The hydrogen ion motion on such hexagonal lattices shows as the
hopping of the ions forward and the holes (vacant places) backward, caused by
the Grotthuss mechanism. By supporting this motion using external infrasound
sources, one may achieve the appearance of the superfluid state of the EZ
water. Flows of the hydrogen ions are described by the modified Navier-Stokes
equation. It, along with the continuity equation, yields the nonlinear
Schrodinger equation, which describes the quantum effects of these flows, such
as the tunneling at long distances or the interference on gap junctions.

was self-reported, while periodontitis, bleeding on probing (BOP), and plaque
index were determined by clinical examinations. Results: Using logistic
regression adjusting for gender, smoking status, age, body mass index, family

the other hand, proportion of BOP sites, and plaque index were not
statistically significant. For a participant with severe periodontitis, the OR
of taking asthma medication was 0.20 (95% confidence interval: 0.09, 0.43) that
of a participant with none/mild periodontitis. Moreover, proportion of BOP
sites was statistically associated to use of asthma medication while plaque
index still remained non-significant. Conclusion: Participants with severe

dysregulations are also closely related to the development and progression of
various human diseases, including cancer. Therefore, identifying new microRNAs
that are associated with diseases contributes to a better understanding of
pathogenicity mechanisms. MicroRNAs also represent a tremendous opportunity in
biotechnology for early diagnosis. To date, several in silico methods have been
developed to address the issue of microRNA-disease association prediction.
However, these methods have various limitations. In this study, we investigate
the hypothesis that information attached to miRNAs and diseases can be revealed
by distributional semantics. Our basic approach is to represent distributional
information on miRNAs and diseases in a high-dimensional vector space and to
define associations between miRNAs and diseases in terms of their vector
similarity. Cross validations performed on a dataset of known miRNA-disease
associations demonstrate the excellent performance of our method. Moreover, the
case study focused on breast cancer confirms the ability of our method to
discover new disease-miRNA associations and to identify putative false
associations reported in databases.

  Distribution Networks"	"  Highly-optimized complex transport networks serve crucial functions in many
man-made and natural systems such as power grids and plant or animal
vasculature. Often, the relevant optimization functional is non-convex and
characterized by many local extrema. In general, finding the global, or nearly
global optimum is difficult. In biological systems, it is believed that natural
selection slowly guides the network towards an optimized state. However,
general coarse grained models for flow networks with local positive feedback
rules for the vessel conductivity typically get trapped in low efficiency,
local minima. In this work we show how the growth of the underlying tissue,
coupled to the dynamical equations for network development, can drive the
system to a dramatically improved optimal state. This general model provides a
surprisingly simple explanation for the appearance of highly optimized
transport networks in biology such as leaf and animal vasculature.

  Signaling"	"  The effects of pulsatile GnRH stimulation on anterior pituitary cells are
studied using perifusion cell cultures, where constantly moving medium over the
immo- bilized cells allows intermittent GnRH delivery. The LH content of the
outgoing medium serves as a readout of the GnRH signaling pathway activation in
the cells. The challenge lies in relating the LH content of the medium leaving
the chamber to the cellular processes producing LH secretion. To investigate
this relation we developed and analyzed a mathematical model consisting of
coupled partial differential equations describing LH secretion in a perifusion
cell culture. We match the mathematical model to three different data sets and
give cellular mechanisms that explain the data. Our model illustrates the
importance of the negative feedback in the signaling pathway and receptor
desensitization. We demonstrate that different LH outcomes in oxytocin and GnRH
stimulations might originate from different receptor dynamics and
concentration. We ana- lyze the model to understand the influence of
parameters, like the velocity of the medium flow or the fraction collection
time, on the LH outcomes. We show that slow velocities lead to high LH
outcomes. Also, we show that fraction collection times, which do not divide the
GnRH pulse period evenly, lead to irregularities in the data. We examine the
influence of the rate of binding and dissociation of GnRH on the GnRH movement
down the chamber. Our model serves as an important tool that can help in the
design of perifusion experiments and the interpretation of results.

  mapping"	"  Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) is a major method for studying
brain-behavior relationships that leverages modern neuroimaging analysis
techniques to build on the classic approach of examining the relationship
between location of brain damage and cognitive deficits. Testing an association
between deficit severity and lesion status in each voxel involves very many
individual tests and requires statistical correction for multiple comparisons.
Several strategies have been adapted from analysis of functional neuroimaging
data, though VLSM faces a more difficult trade-off between avoiding false
positives and statistical power (missing true effects). One such strategy is
using permutation to non-parametrically determine a null distribution of
cluster sizes, which is then used to establish a minimum cluster size
threshold. This strategy is intuitively appealing because it respects the
necessary spatial contiguity of stroke lesions and connects with the typical
cluster-based interpretation of VLSM results. We evaluated this strategy for
detecting true lesion-symptom relations using simulated deficit scores based on
percent damage to defined brain regions (BA 45 and BA 39) in a sample of 124
individuals with left hemisphere stroke. Even under the most conservative
settings tested here, the region identified by VLSM with cluster size
correction systematically extended well beyond the true region. As a result,
this strategy appears to be effective for ruling out situations with no true
lesion-symptom relations, but the spatial contiguity of stroke lesions may
cause identified lesion-symptom relations to extend beyond their true regions.

infection. Experiments where individuals are successively infected with
different strains within a short timeframe provide insight into the underlying
viral dynamics and the role of a cross-reactive immune response in resolving an
acute infection. We construct a mathematical model of within-host influenza
viral dynamics including three possible factors which determine the strength of
the cross-reactive cellular adaptive immune response: the initial naive T cell
number, the avidity of the interaction between T cells and the epitopes
presented by infected cells, and the epitope abundance per infected cell. Our
model explains the experimentally observed shortening of a second infection
when cross-reactivity is present, and shows that memory in the cellular
adaptive immune response is necessary to protect against a second infection.

1606.00535	q-bio	q-bio.CB	"Conditions for cell size homeostasis: A stochastic hybrid systems
  approach"	"  A ubiquitous feature of living cells is their growth over time followed by
division into daughter cells. How isogenic cell populations maintain size
homeostasis, i.e., a narrow distribution of cell size, is an intriguing
fundamental problem. We model cell size using a stochastic hybrid system, where
a cell grows exponentially in size (volume) over time and probabilistic
division events are triggered at discrete time intervals. Moreover, whenever
division events occur, size is randomly partitioned among daughter cells. We
first consider a scenario, where a timer (i.e., cell-cycle clock) that measures
the time since the last division event regulates both the cellular growth and
division rates. Analysis reveals that such a timer-controlled system cannot
achieve size homeostasis, in the sense that, the cell-to-cell size variation
grows unboundedly with time. To explore biologically meaningful mechanisms for
controlling size we consider two classes of regulation: a size-dependent growth
rate and a size-dependent division rate. Our results show that these strategies
can provide bounded intercellular variation in cell size, and exact
mathematical conditions on the form of regulation needed for size homeostasis
are derived. Different known forms of size control strategies, such as, the
adder and the sizer are shown to be consistent with these results.
Interestingly, for timer-based division mechanisms, the mean cell size depends
on the noise in the cell-cycle duration but independent of errors incurred in
partitioning of volume among daughter cells. In contrast, the mean cell size
decreases with increasing partitioning errors for size-based division
mechanisms. Finally, we discuss how organisms ranging from bacteria to
mammalian cells have adopted different control approaches for maintaining size
homeostasis.

well known phenomena caused by nonlinear dynamics. Production of single tree of
Citrus Unshiu trees is recognized to be driven by a mechanistic process modeled
with the so-called ""resource budget model"", which demonstrates phenomenon of
alternate bearing. However, the term of alternative bearing is used not only
for an individual tree's production but also for total production of a large

theoretical possibility of a substantial alternate bearing effect even in a

1606.01017	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Combining EEG source connectivity and network similarity: Application to
  object categorization in the human brain"	"  A major challenge in cognitive neuroscience is to evaluate the ability of the
human brain to categorize or group visual stimuli based on common features.
This categorization process is very fast and occurs in few hundreds of
millisecond time scale. However, an accurate tracking of the spatiotemporal
dynamics of large-scale brain networks is still an unsolved issue. Here, we
show the combination of recently developed method called dense-EEG source
connectivity to identify functional brain networks with excellent temporal and
spatial resolutions and an algorithm, called SimNet, to compute brain networks
similarity. Two categories of visual stimuli were analysed in this study:
immobile and mobile. Networks similarity was assessed within each category
(intra-condition) and between categories (inter-condition). Results showed high
similarity within each category and low similarity between the two categories.
A significant difference between similarities computed in the intra and
inter-conditions was observed at the period of 120-190ms supposed to be related
to visual recognition and memory access. We speculate that these observations
will be very helpful toward understanding the object categorization in the
human brain from a network perspective.

1606.01239	q-bio	cs.NE q-bio.NC	Grid-like structure is optimal for path integration	"  Grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex are believed to play a key role in
path integration. However, the relation between path integration and the
grid-like arrangement of their firing field remains unclear. We provide
theoretical evidence that grid-like structure and path integration are closely
related. In one dimension, the grid-like structure provides the optimal
solution for path integration assuming that the noise correlation structure is
Gaussian. In two dimensions, assuming that the noise is Gaussian, rectangular
grid-like structure is the optimal solution provided that 1- both noise
correlation and receptive field structures of the neurons can be
multiplicatively decomposed into orthogonal components and 2- the eigenvalues
of the decomposed correlation matrices decrease faster than the square of the
frequency of the corresponding eigenvectors. We will also address the decoding
mechanism and show that the problem of decoding reduces to the problem of
extracting task relevant information in the presence of task irrelevant
information. Change-based Population Coding provides the optimal solution for
this problem.

studied by a mesoscopic Hamiltonian method which incorporates both the bending
of the molecule axis and the intrinsic twist of the DNA strands. The base pair
fluctuations with respect to the helix diameter are treated as path
trajectories in the imaginary time path integral formalism. The partition
function for the sub-ensemble of closed molecules is computed by imposing chain
ends boundary conditions both on the radial fluctuations and on the angular
degrees of freedom. The cyclization probability, the J-factor, proves to be
highly sensitive to the stacking potential, mostly to its nonlinear parameters.
We find that the J-factor generally decreases by reducing the sequence length (
N ) and, more significantly, below N = 100 base pairs. However, even for very
small molecules, the J-factors remain sizeable in line with recent experimental
indications. Large bending angles between adjacent base pairs and anharmonic
stacking appear as the causes of the helix flexibility at short length scales.

inhibitory GABAergic autaptic connections. By computational modelling, we
investigate how autaptic inhibition regulates the firing response of such
interneurons. Our results indicate that autaptic inhibition both boosts the
current threshold for action potential generation as well as modulates the
input-output gain of FS interneurons. The autaptic transmission delay is
identified as a key parameter that controls the firing patterns and determines
multistability regions of FS interneurons. Furthermore, we observe that
neuronal noise influences the firing regulation of FS interneurons by autaptic
inhibition and extends their dynamic range for encoding inputs. Importantly,
autaptic inhibition modulates noise-induced irregular firing of FS
interneurons, such that coherent firing appears at an optimal autaptic
inhibition level. Our result reveal the functional roles of autaptic inhibition
in taming the firing dynamics of FS interneurons.

1606.01392	q-bio	physics.bio-ph cond-mat.soft q-bio.CB	The Physics of Biofilms -- An Introduction	"  Biofilms are complex, self-organized consortia of microorganisms that produce
a functional, protective matrix of biomolecules. Physically, the structure of a
biofilm can be described as an entangled polymer network which grows and
changes under the effect of gradients of nutrients, cell differentiation,
quorum sensing, bacterial motion, and interaction with the environment. Its
development is complex, and constantly adapting to environmental stimuli. Here,
we review the fundamental physical processes the govern the inception, growth
and development of a biofilm. Two important mechanisms guide the initial phase
in a biofilm life cycle: (\emph{i}) the cell motility near or at a solid
interface, and (\emph{ii}) the cellular adhesion. Both processes are crucial
for initiating the colony and for ensuring its stability. A mature biofilm
behaves as a viscoelastic fluid with a complex, history-dependent dynamics. We
discuss progress and challenges in the determination of its physical
properties. Experimental and theoretical methods are now available that aim at
integrating the biofilm's hierarchy of interactions, and the heterogeneity of
composition and spatial structures. We also discuss important directions in
which future work should be directed.

1606.01401	q-bio	q-bio.PE physics.soc-ph	Evolutionary consequences of behavioral diversity	"  Iterated games provide a framework to describe social interactions among
groups of individuals. Recent work stimulated by the discovery of
""zero-determinant"" strategies has rapidly expanded our ability to analyze such
interactions. This body of work has primarily focused on games in which players
face a simple binary choice, to ""cooperate"" or ""defect"". Real individuals,
however, often exhibit behavioral diversity, varying their input to a social
interaction both qualitatively and quantitatively. Here we explore how access
to a greater diversity of behavioral choices impacts the evolution of social
dynamics in finite populations. We show that, in public goods games, some
two-choice strategies can nonetheless resist invasion by all possible
multi-choice invaders, even while engaging in relatively little punishment. We
also show that access to greater behavioral choice results in more ""rugged ""
fitness landscapes, with populations able to stabilize cooperation at multiple
levels of investment, such that choice facilitates cooperation when returns on
investments are low, but hinders cooperation when returns on investments are
high. Finally, we analyze iterated rock-paper-scissors games, whose
non-transitive payoff structure means unilateral control is difficult and
zero-determinant strategies do not exist in general. Despite this, we find that
a large portion of multi-choice strategies can invade and resist invasion by
strategies that lack behavioral diversity -- so that even well-mixed
populations will tend to evolve behavioral diversity.

1606.01552	q-bio	cs.NE q-bio.NC	"View-tolerant face recognition and Hebbian learning imply
  mirror-symmetric neural tuning to head orientation"	"  The primate brain contains a hierarchy of visual areas, dubbed the ventral
stream, which rapidly computes object representations that are both specific
for object identity and relatively robust against identity-preserving
transformations like depth-rotations. Current computational models of object
recognition, including recent deep learning networks, generate these properties
through a hierarchy of alternating selectivity-increasing filtering and
tolerance-increasing pooling operations, similar to simple-complex cells
operations. While simulations of these models recapitulate the ventral stream's
progression from early view-specific to late view-tolerant representations,
they fail to generate the most salient property of the intermediate
representation for faces found in the brain: mirror-symmetric tuning of the
neural population to head orientation. Here we prove that a class of
hierarchical architectures and a broad set of biologically plausible learning
rules can provide approximate invariance at the top level of the network. While
most of the learning rules do not yield mirror-symmetry in the mid-level
representations, we characterize a specific biologically-plausible Hebb-type
learning rule that is guaranteed to generate mirror-symmetric tuning to faces
tuning at intermediate levels of the architecture.

1606.01651	q-bio	cs.LG cs.NE q-bio.NC	"Feedforward Initialization for Fast Inference of Deep Generative
  Networks is biologically plausible"	"  We consider deep multi-layered generative models such as Boltzmann machines
or Hopfield nets in which computation (which implements inference) is both
recurrent and stochastic, but where the recurrence is not to model sequential
structure, only to perform computation. We find conditions under which a simple
feedforward computation is a very good initialization for inference, after the
input units are clamped to observed values. It means that after the feedforward
initialization, the recurrent network is very close to a fixed point of the
network dynamics, where the energy gradient is 0. The main condition is that
consecutive layers form a good auto-encoder, or more generally that different
groups of inputs into the unit (in particular, bottom-up inputs on one hand,
top-down inputs on the other hand) are consistent with each other, producing
the same contribution into the total weighted sum of inputs. In biological
terms, this would correspond to having each dendritic branch correctly
predicting the aggregate input from all the dendritic branches, i.e., the soma
potential. This is consistent with the prediction that the synaptic weights
into dendritic branches such as those of the apical and basal dendrites of
pyramidal cells are trained to minimize the prediction error made by the
dendritic branch when the target is the somatic activity. Whereas previous work
has shown how to achieve fast negative phase inference (when the model is
unclamped) in a predictive recurrent model, this contribution helps to achieve
fast positive phase inference (when the target output is clamped) in such
recurrent neural models.

1606.01684	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Regulation of Irregular Neuronal Firing by Autaptic Transmission	"  The importance of self-feedback autaptic transmission in modulating
spike-time irregularity is still poorly understood. By using a biophysical
model that incorporates autaptic coupling, we here show that self-innervation
of neurons participates in the modulation of irregular neuronal firing,
primarily by regulating the occurrence frequency of burst firing. In
particular, we find that both excitatory and electrical autapses increase the
occurrence of burst firing, thus reducing neuronal firing regularity. In
contrast, inhibitory autapses suppress burst firing and therefore tend to
improve the regularity of neuronal firing. Importantly, we show that these
findings are independent of the firing properties of individual neurons, and as
such can be observed for neurons operating in different modes. Our results
provide an insightful mechanistic understanding of how different types of
autapses shape irregular firing at the single-neuron level, and they highlight
the functional importance of autaptic self-innervation in taming and modulating
neurodynamics.

1606.01696	q-bio	q-bio.QM physics.chem-ph	Probabilistic Model to Treat Flexibility in Molecular Contacts	"  Evaluating accessible conformational space is computationally expensive and
thermal motions are partly neglected in computer models of molecular
interactions. This produces error into the estimates of binding strength. We
introduce a method for modelling interactions so that structural flexibility is
inherently taken into account. It has a statistical model for 3D properties of
'nonlocal' contacts and a physics based description of 'local' interactions,
based on mechanical torque. The form of the torque barrier is derived using a
representation of the local electronic structure, which is presumed to improve
transferability, compared to traditional force fields. The nonlocal contacts
are more distant than 1-4 interactions and Target-atoms are represented by 3D
probability densities. Probability mass quantifies strength of contact and is
calculated as an overlap integral. Repulsion is described by negative
probability density, allowing probability mass to be used as the descriptor of
contact preference. As a result, we are able to transform the high-dimensional
problem into a simpler evaluation of three-dimensional integrals. We outline
how this scoring function gives a tool to study the enthalpy--entropy
compensation and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by evaluating
numerical probability masses for chosen side chain to main chain contacts in a
lysine dipeptide structure.

biogenesis in intracellular trafficking pathways, its most impressive
manifestation being the biogenesis of Golgi cisternae. At a basic level, such
morphologically and chemically distinct compartments should arise from an
interplay between the molecular transport and chemical maturation. Here, we
formulate analytically tractable, minimalist models, that incorporate this
interplay between transport and chemical progression in physical space, and
explore the conditions for de novo biogenesis of distinct cisternae. We propose
new quantitative measures that can discriminate between the various models of
transport in a qualitative manner- this includes measures of the dynamics in
steady state and the dynamical response to perturbations of the kind amenable
to live-cell imaging.

1606.01788	q-bio	cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.TO	Lattice Percolation Approach to 3D Modeling of Tissue Aging	"  We describe a 3D percolation-type approach to modeling of the processes of
aging and certain other properties of tissues analyzed as systems consisting of
interacting cells. Lattice sites are designated as regular (healthy) cells,
senescent cells, or vacancies left by dead (apoptotic) cells. The system is
then studied dynamically with the ongoing processes including regular cell
dividing to fill vacant sites, healthy cells becoming senescent or dying, and
senescent cells dying. Statistical-mechanics description can provide patterns
of time dependence and snapshots of morphological system properties. The
developed theoretical modeling approach is found not only to corroborate recent
experimental findings that inhibition of senescence can lead to extended
lifespan, but also to confirm that, unlike 2D, in 3D senescent cells can
contribute to tissue's connectivity/mechanical stability. The latter effect
occurs by senescent cells forming the second infinite cluster in the regime
when the regular (healthy) cell's infinite cluster still exits.

1606.01802	q-bio	q-bio.TO	"Image-Based Modeling of Blood Flow and Oxygen Transfer in Feto-Placental
  Capillaries"	"  During pregnancy, oxygen diffuses from maternal to fetal blood through
villous trees in the placenta. In this paper, we simulate blood flow and oxygen
transfer in feto-placental capillaries by converting three-dimensional
representations of villous and capillary surfaces, reconstructed from confocal
laser scanning microscopy, to finite-element meshes, and calculating values of
vascular flow resistance and total oxygen transfer. The relationship between
the total oxygen transfer rate and the pressure drop through the capillary is
shown to be captured across a wide range of pressure drops by physical scaling
laws and an upper bound on the oxygen transfer rate. A regression equation is
introduced that can be used to estimate the oxygen transfer in a capillary
using the vascular resistance. Two techniques for quantifying the effects of
statistical variability, experimental uncertainty and pathological placental
structure on the calculated properties are then introduced. First, scaling
arguments are used to quantify the sensitivity of the model to uncertainties in
the geometry and the parameters. Second, the effects of localized dilations in
fetal capillaries are investigated using an idealized axisymmetric model, to
quantify the possible effect of pathological placental structure on oxygen
transfer. The model predicts how, for a fixed pressure drop through a
capillary, oxygen transfer is maximized by an optimal width of the dilation.
The results could explain the prevalence of fetal hypoxia in cases of delayed
villous maturation, a pathology characterized by a lack of the
vasculo-syncytial membranes often seen in conjunction with localized capillary
dilations.

dipeptides, and their interactions with the divalent cations Ca$^{2+}$,
Ba$^{2+}$, Sr$^{2+}$, Cd$^{2+}$, Pb$^{2+}$, and Hg$^{2+}$. The underlying data
set consists of 45,892 first-principles predicted conformers with relative
energies up to about 4 eV (about 400kJ/mol). We show that only very few
distinct backbone structures of isolated amino acids and their dipeptides
emerge as lowest-energy conformers. The isolated amino acids predominantly
adopt structures that involve an acidic proton shared between the carboxy and
amino function. Dipeptides adopt one of two intramolecular-hydrogen bonded
conformations C$_5$ or equatorial C$_7$. Upon complexation with a divalent
cation, the accessible conformational space shrinks and intramolecular hydrogen
bonding is prevented due to strong electrostatic interaction of backbone and
side chain functional groups with cations. Clear correlations emerge from the
binding energies of the six divalent ions with amino acids and dipeptides.
Cd$^{2+}$ and Hg$^{2+}$ show the largest binding energies - a potential
correlation with their known high acute toxicities. Ca$^{2+}$ and Pb$^{2+}$
reveal almost identical binding energies across the entire series of amino
acids and dipeptides. This observation validates past indications that
ion-mimicry of calcium and lead should play an important role in a
toxicological context.

  VEGFA-Notch signaling in a dynamic stalk-tip cell selection"	"  During angiogenesis, new blood vessels headed by a migrating endothelial tip
cell sprout from pre-existing ones. This process is known to be regulated by
two signaling pathways concurrently, vascular endothelial growth factor A
(VEGFA) and Notch-Delta. Extracellular VEGFA activates the intracellular
Notch-Delta pathway in nearby endothelial cells which results in endothelial
(stalk, tip) differentiation. Retinal astrocytes appear to play a crucial role
in polarizing new sprouts by secreting VEGFA. \emph{In vivo} retinal
angiogenesis experiments in neonatal mouse generated quantitative data on daily
cell counts and morphological data of vascular network expanding over
fibronectin-rich matrix. Based on this set of data and other existing ones, we
developed a cell-based, multiscale mathematical model using the cellular Potts
model framework to investigate the sprout evolution by integrating the VEGFA
and Notch-Delta signaling pathways. The model incorporates three levels of
description: intracellular, intercellular, and extracellular. Starting with a
single astrocyte embedded in a fibronectin-rich matrix, we use the model to
assess different scenarios regarding VEGFA levels and its interaction with
matrix proteins. Simulation results suggest that astrocyte-derived VEGFA
gradients along with heterogeneous ECM reproduces sprouting morphology, and the
extension speed is in agreement with experimental data in 7 days postnatal
mouse retina. Results also reproduce empirical observations in sprouting
angiogenesis, including anastomosis, dynamic tip cell competition, and sprout
regression as a result of Notch blockade.

1606.02191	q-bio	physics.bio-ph cond-mat.soft q-bio.SC	Run-and-pause dynamics of cytoskeletal motor proteins	"  Cytoskeletal motor proteins are involved in major intracellular transport
processes which are vital for maintaining appropriate cellular function. The
motor exhibits distinct states of motility: active motion along filaments, and
effectively stationary phase in which it detaches from the filaments and
performs passive diffusion in the vicinity of the detachment point due to
cytoplasmic crowding. The transition rates between motion and pause phases are
asymmetric in general, and considerably affected by changes in environmental
conditions which influences the efficiency of cargo delivery to specific
targets. By considering the motion of molecular motor on a single filament as
well as a dynamic filamentous network, we present an analytical model for the
dynamics of self-propelled particles which undergo frequent pause phases. The
interplay between motor processivity, structural properties of filamentous
network, and transition rates between the two states of motility drastically
changes the dynamics: multiple transitions between different types of anomalous
diffusive dynamics occur and the crossover time to the asymptotic diffusive or
ballistic motion varies by several orders of magnitude. We map out the phase
diagrams in the space of transition rates, and address the role of initial
conditions of motion on the resulting dynamics.

and are often assumed to embody the physiological substrate of cognitive
processes. Here we analyse the temporal and spatial dynamics of these states,
as measured by EEG, with a hidden Markov model and compare this approach to
classical EEG microstate analysis. We find dominating state lifetimes of
100--150\,ms for both approaches. The state topographies show obvious
similarities. However, they also feature distinct spatial and especially
temporal properties. These differences may carry physiological meaningful
information originating from patterns in the data that the HMM is able to
integrate while the microstate analysis is not. This hypothesis is supported by
a consistently high pairwise correlation of the temporal evolution of EEG
microstates which is not observed for the HMM states and which seems unlikely
to be a good description of the underlying physiology. However, further
investigation is required to determine the robustness and the functional and
clinical relevance of EEG HMM states in comparison to EEG microstates.

1606.02349	q-bio	q-bio.NC stat.ML	Locally-Optimized Inter-Subject Alignment of Functional Cortical Regions	"  Inter-subject registration of cortical areas is necessary in functional
imaging (fMRI) studies for making inferences about equivalent brain function
across a population. However, many high-level visual brain areas are defined as
peaks of functional contrasts whose cortical position is highly variable. As
such, most alignment methods fail to accurately map functional regions of
interest (ROIs) across participants. To address this problem, we propose a
locally optimized registration method that directly predicts the location of a
seed ROI on a separate target cortical sheet by maximizing the functional
correlation between their time courses, while simultaneously allowing for
non-smooth local deformations in region topology. Our method outperforms the
two most commonly used alternatives (anatomical landmark-based AFNI alignment
and cortical convexity-based FreeSurfer alignment) in overlap between predicted
region and functionally-defined LOC. Furthermore, the maps obtained using our
method are more consistent across subjects than both baseline measures.
Critically, our method represents an important step forward towards predicting
brain regions without explicit localizer scans and deciphering the poorly
understood relationship between the location of functional regions, their
anatomical extent, and the consistency of computations those regions perform
across people.

1606.02372	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Entrainment of traveling waves to rhythmic motor acts	"  We hypothesized that rhythmic motor acts entrain neural oscillations in
speech production brain regions. We tested this hypothesis in an experiment
where a subject produced consonant-vowel (CV) syllables in a rhythmic fashion,
while we performed ECoG recordings. Over the ventral sensorimotor cortex (vSMC)
we detected significant concentration of phase across trials at the specific
frequency of speech production. We also observed amplitude modulations. In
addition we found significant coupling between the phase of brain oscillations
at the frequency of speech production and their amplitude in the high-gamma
range (i.e., phase-amplitude coupling, PAC). Furthermore, we saw that brain
oscillations at the frequency of speech production organized as traveling waves
(TWs), synchronized to the rhythm of speech production. It has been
hypothesized that PAC is a mechanism to allow low-frequency oscillations to
synchronize with high-frequency neural activity so that spiking occurs at
behaviorally relevant times. If this hypothesis is true, when PAC coexists with
TWs, we expect a specific organization of PAC curves. We observed this
organization experimentally and verified that the peaks of high-gamma
oscillations, and therefore spiking, occur at the same times across electrodes.
Importantly, we observed that these spiking times were synchronized with the
rhythm of speech production. To our knowledge, this is the first report of
motor actions organizing (a) the phase coherence of low-frequency brain
oscillations, (b) the coupling between the phase of these oscillations and the
amplitude of high-frequency oscillations, and (c) TW. It is also the first
demonstration that TWs induce an organization of PAC so that spiking across
spatial locations is synchronized to behaviorally relevant times.

Langevin dynamics can be embedded in an extended stochastic model without

1606.02765	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Transient cell assembly networks encode persistent spatial memories	"  While cognitive representations of an environment can last for days and even
months, the synaptic architecture of the neuronal networks that underlie these
representations constantly changes due to various forms of synaptic and
structural plasticity at a much faster timescale. This raises an immediate
question: how can a transient network maintain a stable representation of
space? In the following, we propose a computational model for describing
emergence of the hippocampal cognitive map in a network of transient place cell
assemblies and demonstrate, using methods of algebraic topology, that such a
network can maintain a robust map of the environment.

1606.02769	q-bio	physics.bio-ph cond-mat.soft q-bio.SC	Landau Theory and the Emergence of Chirality in Viral Capsids	"  We present a generalized Landau-Brazovskii theory for the solidification of
chiral molecules on a spherical surface. With increasing sphere radius one
encounters first intervals where robust achiral density modulations appear with
icosahedral symmetry via first-order transitions. Next, one en- counters
intervals where fragile but stable icosahedral structures still can be
constructed but only by superposition of multiple irreducible representations.
Chiral icoshedral structures appear via continuous or very weakly first-order
transitions. Outside these parameter intervals, icosahedral symmetry is broken
along a three-fold axis or a five-fold axis. The predictions of the theory are
compared with recent numerical simulations.

1606.02801	q-bio	q-bio.QM	Identifying statistically significant patterns in gene expression data	"  Motivation: Clustering techniques are routinely applied to identify patterns
of co-expression in gene expression data. Co-regulation, and involvement of
genes in similar cellular function, is subsequently inferred from the clusters
which are obtained. Increasingly sophisticated algorithms have been applied to
microarray data, however, less attention has been given to the statistical
significance of the results of clustering studies. We present a technique for
the analysis of commonly used hierarchical linkage-based clustering called
Significance Analysis of Linkage Trees (SALT).
  Results: The statistical significance of pairwise similarity levels between
gene expression profiles, a measure of co-expression, is established using a
surrogate data analysis method. We find that a modified version of the standard
linkage technique, complete-linkage, must be used to generate hierarchical
linkage trees with the appropriate properties. The approach is illustrated
using synthetic data generated from a novel model of gene expression profiles
and is then applied to previously analysed microarray data on the
transcriptional response of human fibroblasts to serum stimulation.

1606.02837	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Spatial neutral dynamics	"  Neutral models, in which individual agents with equal fitness undergo a
birth-death-mutation process, are very popular in population genetics and
community ecology. Usually these models are applied to populations and
communities with spatial structure, but the analytic results presented so far
are limited to well-mixed or mainland-island scenarios. Here we present a new
technique, based on interface dynamics analysis, and apply it to the neutral
dynamics in one, two and three spatial dimensions. New results are derived for
the correlation length and for the main characteristics of the community, like
total biodiversity and the species abundance distribution above the correlation
length. Our results are supported by extensive numerical simulations, and
provide qualitative and quantitative insights that allow for a rigorous
comparison between model predictions and empirical data.

1606.02840	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Decoding dynamic brain patterns from evoked responses: A tutorial on
  multivariate pattern analysis applied to time-series neuroimaging data"	"  Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) or brain decoding methods have become
standard practice in analysing fMRI data. Although decoding methods have been
extensively applied in Brain Computing Interfaces (BCI), these methods have
only recently been applied to time-series neuroimaging data such as MEG and EEG
to address experimental questions in Cognitive Neuroscience. In a
tutorial-style review, we describe a broad set of options to inform future
time-series decoding studies from a Cognitive Neuroscience perspective. Using
example MEG data, we illustrate the effects that different options in the
decoding analysis pipeline can have on experimental results where the aim is to
'decode' different perceptual stimuli or cognitive states over time from
dynamic brain activation patterns. We show that decisions made at both
preprocessing (e.g., dimensionality reduction, subsampling, trial averaging)
and decoding (e.g., classifier selection, cross-validation design) stages of
the analysis can significantly affect the results. In addition to standard
decoding, we describe extensions to MVPA for time-varying neuroimaging data
including representational similarity analysis, temporal generalisation, and
the interpretation of classifier weight maps. Finally, we outline important
caveats in the design and interpretation of time-series decoding experiments.

1606.02859	q-bio	q-bio.MN	Maximal switchability of centralized networks	"  We consider continuous time Hopfield-like recurrent networks as dynamical
models for gene regulation and neural networks. We are interested in networks
that contain n high-degree nodes preferably connected to a large number of Ns
weakly connected satellites, a property that we call n/Ns-centrality. If the
hub dynamics is slow, we obtain that the large time network dynamics is
completely defined by the hub dynamics. Moreover, such networks are maximally
flexible and switchable, in the sense that they can switch from a globally
attractive rest state to any structurally stable dynamics when the response
time of a special controller hub is changed. In particular, we show that a
decrease of the controller hub response time can lead to a sharp variation in
the network attractor structure: we can obtain a set of new local attractors,
whose number can increase exponentially with N, the total number of nodes of
the nework. These new attractors can be periodic or even chaotic. We provide an
algorithm, which allows us to design networks with the desired switching
properties, or to learn them from time series, by adjusting the interactions
between hubs and satellites. Such switchable networks could be used as models
for context dependent adaptation in functional genetics or as models for
cognitive functions in neuroscience.

  metabolic models"	"  Metabolomic data sets provide a direct read-out of cellular phenotypes and
are increasingly generated to study biological questions. Our previous work
revealed the potential of analyzing extracellular metabolomic data in the
context of the metabolic model using constraint-based modeling. Through this
work, which consists of a protocol, a toolbox, and tutorials of two use cases,
we make our methods available to the broader scientific community. The protocol
describes, in a step-wise manner, the workflow of data integration and
computational analysis. The MetaboTools comprise the Matlab code required to
complete the workflow described in the protocol. Tutorials explain the
computational steps for integration of two different data sets and demonstrate
a comprehensive set of methods for the computational analysis of metabolic
models and stratification thereof into different phenotypes. The presented
workflow supports integrative analysis of multiple omics data sets.
Importantly, all analysis tools can be applied to metabolic models without
performing the entire workflow. Taken together, this protocol constitutes a
comprehensive guide to the intra-model analysis of extracellular metabolomic
data and a resource offering a broad set of computational analysis tools for a
wide biomedical and non-biomedical research community.

  Flow"	"  We review modeling of astrocyte ion dynamics with a specific focus on the
implications of so-called spatial potassium buffering, where excess potassium
in the extracellular space (ECS) is transported away to prevent pathological
neural spiking. The recently introduced Kirchoff-Nernst-Planck (KNP) scheme for
modeling ion dynamics in astrocytes (and brain tissue in general) is outlined
and used to study such spatial buffering. We next describe how the ion dynamics
of astrocytes may regulate microscopic liquid flow by osmotic effects and how
such microscopic flow can be linked to whole-brain macroscopic flow. We thus
include the key elements in a putative multiscale theory with astrocytes
linking neural activity on a microscopic scale to macroscopic fluid flow.

1606.03052	q-bio	physics.ed-ph physics.bio-ph physics.ins-det physics.optics q-bio.QM	Microscope Project for Undergraduate Laboratories	"  Optics is an important subfield of physics required for instrument design and
used in a variety of other disciplines, including materials science, physics,
and life sciences such as developmental biology and cell biology. It is
important to educate students from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds in
the basics of optics in order to train the next generation of interdisciplinary
researchers and instrumentalists who will push the boundaries of discovery. In
this paper, we present an experimental system developed to teach students in
the basics of geometric optics, including ray and wave optics. The students
learn these concepts through designing, building, and testing a home-built
light microscope made from component parts. We describe the experimental
equipment and basic measurements students can perform to learn principles,
technique, accuracy, and resolution of measurement. Students find the
magnification and test the resolution of the microscope system they build. The
system is open and versatile to allow advanced building projects, such as
epi-fluorescence, total internal reflection fluorescence, and optical trapping.
We have used this equipment in an optics course, an advanced laboratory course,
and graduate-level training modules.

cancer cells towards their microenvironment, involving pancreatic stellate
cells that interact with cancer cells and influence tumor progression. To
quantitatively understand the pancreatic cancer microenvironment, we construct
a computational model for intracellular signaling networks of cancer cells and
stellate cells as well as their intercellular communication. We extend the
rule-based BioNetGen language to depict intra- and inter-cellular dynamics
using discrete and continuous variables respectively. Our framework also
enables a statistical model checking procedure for analyzing the system
behavior in response to various perturbations. The results demonstrate the
predictive power of our model by identifying important system properties that
are consistent with existing experimental observations. We also obtain
interesting insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies for
pancreatic cancer.

  gene-regulatory networks"	"  Gene regulatory networks can be successfully modeled as Boolean networks. A
much discussed hypothesis says that such model networks reproduce empirical
findings the best if they are tuned to operate at criticality, i.e. at the
borderline between their ordered and disordered phases. Critical networks have
been argued to lead to a number of functional advantages such as maximal
dynamical range, maximal sensitivity to environmental changes, as well as to an
excellent trade off between stability and flexibility. Here, we study the
effect of noise within the context of Boolean networks trained to learn complex
tasks under supervision. We verify that quasi-critical networks are the ones
learning in the fastest possible way --even for asynchronous updating rules--
and that the larger the task complexity the smaller the distance to
criticality. On the other hand, when additional sources of intrinsic noise in
the network states and/or in its wiring pattern are introduced, the optimally
performing networks become clearly subcritical. These results suggest that in
order to compensate for inherent stochasticity, regulatory and other type of
biological networks might become subcritical rather than being critical, all
the most if the task to be performed has limited complexity.

1606.03376	q-bio	stat.ME q-bio.GN stat.AP	Clustering and Classification of Genetic Data Through U-Statistics	"  Genetic data are frequently categorical and have complex dependence
structures that are not always well understood. For this reason, clustering and
classification based on genetic data, while highly relevant, are challenging
statistical problems. Here we consider a highly versatile U-statistics based
approach built on dissimilarities between pairs of data points for
nonparametric clustering. In this work we propose statistical tests to assess
group homogeneity taking into account the multiple testing issues, and a
clustering algorithm based on dissimilarities within and between groups that
highly speeds up the homogeneity test. We also propose a test to verify
classification significance of a sample in one of two groups. A Monte Carlo
simulation study is presented to evaluate power of the classification test,
considering different group sizes and degree of separation. Size and power of
the homogeneity test are also analyzed through simulations that compare it to
competing methods. Finally, the methodology is applied to three different
genetic datasets: global human genetic diversity, breast tumor gene expression
and Dengue virus serotypes. These applications showcase this statistical
framework's ability to answer diverse biological questions while adapting to
the specificities of the different datatypes.

  potential to solvation modeling"	"  This paper explores the impact of surface area, volume, curvature and
Lennard-Jones potential on solvation free energy predictions. Rigidity surfaces
are utilized to generate robust analytical expressions for maximum, minimum,
mean and Gaussian curvatures of solvent-solute interfaces, and define a
generalized Poisson-Boltzmann (GPB) equation with a smooth dielectric profile.
Extensive correlation analysis is performed to examine the linear dependence of
surface area, surface enclosed volume, maximum curvature, minimum curvature,
mean curvature and Gaussian curvature for solvation modeling. It is found that
surface area and surfaces enclosed volumes are highly correlated to each
others, and poorly correlated to various curvatures for six test sets of
molecules. Different curvatures are weakly correlated to each other for six
test sets of molecules, but are strongly correlated to each other within each
test set of molecules. Based on correlation analysis, we construct twenty six
nontrivial nonpolar solvation models. Our numerical results reveal that the
Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential plays a vital role in nonpolar solvation modeling,
especially for molecules involving strong van der Waals interactions. It is
found that curvatures are at least as important as surface area or surface
enclosed volume in nonpolar solvation modeling. In conjugation with the GPB
model, various curvature based nonpolar solvation models are shown to offer
some of the best solvation free energy predictions for a wide range of test
sets. For example, root mean square errors from a model constituting surface
area, volume, mean curvature and LJ potential are less than 0.42 kcal/mol for
all test sets.

1606.03430	q-bio	physics.soc-ph q-bio.NC	Quantum-like models cannot account for the conjunction fallacy	"  Human agents happen to judge that a conjunction of two terms is more probable
than one of the terms, in contradiction with the rules of classical
probabilities---this is the conjunction fallacy. One of the most discussed
accounts of this fallacy is currently the quantum-like explanation, which
relies on models exploiting the mathematics of quantum mechanics. The aim of
this paper is to investigate the empirical adequacy of major quantum-like
models which represent beliefs with quantum states. We first argue that they
can be tested in three different ways, in a question order effect configuration
which is different from the traditional conjunction fallacy experiment. We then
carry out our proposed experiment, with varied methodologies from experimental
economics. The experimental results we get are at odds with the predictions of
the quantum-like models. This strongly suggests that this quantum-like account
of the conjunction fallacy fails. Future possible research paths are discussed.

1606.03482	q-bio	q-bio.OT	Study of human accessibility: physical tests versus numerical simulation	"  Consideration of physical dimensions of the user population is essential to
design adapted environment. This variability in body dimensions (called
""anthropometry"") is involved in design tools commonly used today to assess
user's accommodation (physical mock-ups, population models, database, boundary
manikins, hybrid methods or digital human modeling). Databases are created from
campaigns of measurement. Besides the fact that such measures are costly in
time and money, they give more ""static"" measures of man. They do not take into
account possible stretching limbs that could allow increased accessibility.
This paper presents a methodology for human body modeling, in a dynamic way,
not static. The methodology allows to highlight influences of design and human
behaviour on reach skills, directly induced by the interaction with real
prototypes and not just considered by human physical dimensions. The first part
of the method is to create a database of measurements (arms length, hip
breadth, etc.). From these data, a model of accessibility is proposed. The
accessibility field is determined purely numerically. In parallel, an
experiment is set up to measure the extension of the accessibility field, with
the same people. A comparison of the results is then performed and a new model
of the human body is proposed.

1606.03565	q-bio	q-bio.BM cond-mat.soft physics.bio-ph physics.chem-ph	Flexibility of short DNA helices under mechanical stretching	"  The flexibility of short DNA fragments is studied by a Hamiltonian model
which treats the inter-strand and intra-strand forces at the level of the base
pair. The elastic response of a set of homogeneous helices to externally
applied forces is obtained by computing the average bending angles between
adjacent base pairs along the molecule axis. The ensemble averages are
performed over a room temperature equilibrium distribution of base pair
separations and bending fluctuations. The analysis of the end-to-end distances
and persistence lengths shows that even short sequences with less than $100$
base pairs maintain a significant bendability ascribed to thermal fluctuational
effects and kinks with large bending angles. The discrepancies between the
outcomes of the discrete model and those of the worm-like-chain model are
examined pointing out the inadequacy of the latter on short length scales.

1606.03592	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Balanced activation in a simple embodied neural simulation	"  In recent years, there have been many computational simulations of
spontaneous neural dynamics. Here, we explore a model of spontaneous neural
dynamics and allow it to control a virtual agent moving in a simple
environment. This setup generates interesting brain-environment feedback
interactions that rapidly destabilize neural and behavioral dynamics and
suggest the need for homeostatic mechanisms. We investigate roles for both
local homeostatic plasticity (local inhibition adjusting over time to balance
excitatory input) as well as macroscopic task negative activity (that
compensates for task positive, sensory input) in regulating both neural
activity and resulting behavior (trajectories through the environment). Our
results suggest complementary functional roles for both local homeostatic
plasticity and balanced activity across brain regions in maintaining neural and
behavioral dynamics. These findings suggest important functional roles for
homeostatic systems in maintaining neural and behavioral dynamics and suggest a
novel functional role for frequently reported macroscopic task-negative
patterns of activity (e.g., the default mode network).

1606.03620	q-bio	q-bio.OT	Modelling Early Transitions Toward Autonomous Protocells	"  This thesis broadly concerns the origins of life problem, pursuing a joint
approach that combines general philosophical/conceptual reflection on the
problem along with more detailed and formal scientific modelling work oriented
in the conceptual perspective developed. The central subject matter addressed
is the emergence and maintenance of compartmentalised chemistries as precursors
of more complex systems with a proper cellular organization. Whereas an
evolutionary conception of life dominates prebiotic chemistry research and
overflows into the protocells field, this thesis defends that the 'autonomous
systems perspective' of living phenomena is a suitable - arguably the most
suitable - conceptual framework to serve as a backdrop for protocell research.
The autonomy approach allows a careful and thorough reformulation of the
origins of cellular life problem as the problem of how integrated autopoietic
chemical organisation, present in all full-fledged cells, originated and
developed from more simple far-from-equilibrium chemical aggregate systems.

1606.03623	q-bio	stat.ML cs.LG q-bio.QM	"Drug response prediction by inferring pathway-response associations with
  Kernelized Bayesian Matrix Factorization"	"  A key goal of computational personalized medicine is to systematically
utilize genomic and other molecular features of samples to predict drug
responses for a previously unseen sample. Such predictions are valuable for
developing hypotheses for selecting therapies tailored for individual patients.
This is especially valuable in oncology, where molecular and genetic
heterogeneity of the cells has a major impact on the response. However, the
prediction task is extremely challenging, raising the need for methods that can
effectively model and predict drug responses. In this study, we propose a novel
formulation of multi-task matrix factorization that allows selective data
integration for predicting drug responses. To solve the modeling task, we
extend the state-of-the-art kernelized Bayesian matrix factorization (KBMF)
method with component-wise multiple kernel learning. In addition, our approach
exploits the known pathway information in a novel and biologically meaningful
fashion to learn the drug response associations. Our method quantitatively
outperforms the state of the art on predicting drug responses in two publicly
available cancer data sets as well as on a synthetic data set. In addition, we
validated our model predictions with lab experiments using an in-house cancer
cell line panel. We finally show the practical applicability of the proposed
method by utilizing prior knowledge to infer pathway-drug response
associations, opening up the opportunity for elucidating drug action
mechanisms. We demonstrate that pathway-response associations can be learned by
the proposed model for the well known EGFR and MEK inhibitors.

  (SmAPs)"	"  Sm proteins were discovered nearly 20 years ago as a group of small antigenic
proteins ($\approx$ 90-120 residues). Since then, an extensive amount of
biochemical and genetic data have illuminated the crucial roles of these
proteins in forming ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes that are used in RNA
processing, e.g., spliceosomal removal of introns from pre-mRNAs. Spliceosomes
are large macromolecular machines that are comparable to ribosomes in size and
complexity, and are composed of uridine-rich small nuclear RNPs (U snRNPs).
Various sets of seven different Sm proteins form the cores of most snRNPs.
Despite their importance, very little is known about the atomic-resolution
structure of snRNPs or their Sm cores. As a first step towards a
high-resolution image of snRNPs and their hierarchic assembly, we have
determined the crystal structures of archaeal homologs of Sm proteins, which we

1606.03813	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Towards an integration of deep learning and neuroscience	"  Neuroscience has focused on the detailed implementation of computation,
studying neural codes, dynamics and circuits. In machine learning, however,
artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or
circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using
simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments
have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect
these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are
used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of
short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training
procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time.
Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1)
the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) these cost functions are diverse and
differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization
operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational
problems posed by behavior. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by
a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient
and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by
which neuroscience could seek to refine and test these hypotheses.

  Atrial Fibrillation"	"  Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke by a factor of four to
five and is the most common abnormal heart rhythm. The progression of AF with
age, from short self-terminating episodes to persistence, varies between
individuals and is poorly understood. An inability to understand and predict
variation in AF progression has resulted in less patient-specific therapy.
Likewise, it has been a challenge to relate the microstructural features of
heart muscle tissue (myocardial architecture) with the emergent temporal
clinical patterns of AF. We use a simple model of activation wavefront
propagation on an anisotropic structure, mimicking heart muscle tissue, to show
how variation in AF behaviour arises naturally from microstructural differences
between individuals. We show that the stochastic nature of progressive
transversal uncoupling of muscle strands (e.g., due to fibrosis or gap
junctional remodelling), as occurs with age, results in variability in AF
episode onset time, frequency, duration, burden and progression between
individuals. This is consistent with clinical observations. The uncoupling of
muscle strands can cause critical architectural patterns in the myocardium.
These critical patterns anchor micro-re-entrant wavefronts and thereby trigger
AF. It is the number of local critical patterns of uncoupling as opposed to
global uncoupling that determines AF progression. This insight may eventually
lead to patient specific therapy when it becomes possible to observe the
cellular structure of a patient's heart.

same time unknown interaction networks or rate constants can present quenched
uncertainty. Existing approaches often involve repeated sampling of the
quenched disorder and then running the stochastic birth-death dynamics on these
samples. In this paper we take a different view, and formulate an effective
jump process, representative of the ensemble of quenched interactions as a
whole. Using evolutionary games with random payoff matrices as an example, we
develop an algorithm to simulate this process, and we discuss diffusion
approximations in the limit of weak intrinsic noise.

been the subject of several modeling efforts in recent literature. Existing
models assume that the tube adaptation mechanism in P. polycephalum's tubular
network is controlled by the sheer amount of fluid flow through the tubes. We
put forward the hypothesis that the controlling variable may instead be the
flow's pressure gradient along the tube. We carry out the stability analysis of
such a revised mathematical model for a parallel-edge network, proving that the
revised model supports the global flow-optimizing behavior of the slime mold
for a substantially wider class of response functions compared to previous
models. Simulations also suggest that the same conclusion may be valid for
arbitrary network topologies.

1606.04295	q-bio	physics.bio-ph cond-mat.soft q-bio.SC	Mechanical stability of bipolar spindle assembly	"  Assembly and stability of mitotic spindle is governed by the interplay of
various intra-cellular forces, e.g. the forces generated by motor proteins by
sliding overlapping anti-parallel microtubules (MTs) polymerized from the
opposite centrosomes, the interaction of kinetochores with MTs, and the
interaction of MTs with the chromosomes arms. We study the mechanical behavior
and stability of spindle assembly within the framework of a minimal model which
includes all these effects. For this model, we derive a closed--form analytical
expression for the force acting between the centrosomes as a function of their
separation distance and we show that an effective potential can be associated
with the interactions at play. We obtain the stability diagram of spindle
formation in terms of parameters characterizing the strength of motor sliding,
repulsive forces generated by polymerizing MTs, and the forces arising out of
interaction of MTs with kinetochores. The stability diagram helps in
quantifying the relative effects of the different interactions and elucidates
the role of motor proteins in formation and inhibition of spindle structures
during mitotic cell division. We also predict a regime of bistability for
certain parameter range, wherein the spindle structure can be stable for two
different finite separation distances between centrosomes. This occurrence of
bistability also suggests mechanical versatility of such self-assembled spindle
structures.

recent results from simulations and theory that lead to novel insights on how
the binding equilibrium and kinetics of these proteins is affected by the

  reactive brain states in driving"	"  Conventional neuroimaging analyses have revealed the computational
specificity of localized brain regions, exploiting the power of the subtraction
technique in fMRI and event-related potential analyses in EEG. Moving beyond
this convention, many researchers have begun exploring network-based
neurodynamics and coordination between brain regions as a function of
behavioral parameters or environmental statistics; however, most approaches
average evoked activity across the experimental session to study task-dependent
networks. Here, we examined on-going oscillatory activity and use a methodology
to estimate directionality in brain-behavior interactions. After source
reconstruction, activity within specific frequency bands in a priori regions of
interest was linked to continuous behavioral measurements, and we used a
predictive filtering scheme to estimate the asymmetry between brain-to-behavior
and behavior-to-brain prediction. We applied this approach to a simulated
driving task and examine directed relationships between brain activity and
continuous driving behavior (steering or heading error). Our results indicated
that two neuro-behavioral states emerge in this naturalistic environment: a
Proactive brain state that actively plans the response to the sensory
information, and a Reactive brain state that processes incoming information and
reacts to environmental statistics.

interactions to attain human-level performance. Humans, on the other hand, can
very quickly exploit highly rewarding nuances of an environment upon first
discovery. In the brain, such rapid learning is thought to depend on the
hippocampus and its capacity for episodic memory. Here we investigate whether a
simple model of hippocampal episodic control can learn to solve difficult
sequential decision-making tasks. We demonstrate that it not only attains a
highly rewarding strategy significantly faster than state-of-the-art deep
reinforcement learning algorithms, but also achieves a higher overall reward on
some of the more challenging domains.

  cross-immunity"	"  Incidence of whooping cough, an infection caused by Bordetella pertussis and
Bordetella parapertussis, has been on the rise since the 1980s in many
countries. Immunological interactions, such as immune boosting and
cross-immunity between pathogens, have been hypothesised to be important
drivers of epidemiological dynamics. We present a two-pathogen model of
transmission which examines how immune boosting and cross-immunity can
influence the timing and severity of epidemics. We use a combination of
numerical simulations and bifurcation techniques to study the dynamical
properties of the system, particularly the conditions under which stable
periodic solutions are present. We derive analytic expressions for the steady
state of the single-pathogen model, and give a condition for the presence of
periodic solutions. A key result from our two-pathogen model is that, while
studies have shown that immune boosting at relatively strong levels can
independently generate periodic solutions, cross-immunity allows for the
presence of periodic solutions even when the level of immune boosting is weak.
Asymmetric cross-immunity can produce striking increases in the incidence and
period. Our study underscores the importance of developing a better
understanding of the immunological interactions between pathogens in order to
improve model-based interpretations of epidemiological data.

  novo Establishment and 3D Organisation of Chromatin Domains"	"  One of the most important problems in development is how epigenetic domains
can be first established, and then maintained, within cells. To address this
question, we propose a framework which couples 3D chromatin folding dynamics,
to a ""recolouring"" process modelling the writing of epigenetic marks. Because
many intra-chromatin interactions are mediated by bridging proteins, we
consider a ""two-state"" model with self-attractive interactions between two
epigenetic marks which are alike (either active or inactive). This model
displays a first-order-like transition between a swollen, epigenetically
disordered, phase, and a compact, epigenetically coherent, chromatin globule.
If the self-attraction strength exceeds a threshold, the chromatin dynamics
becomes glassy, and the corresponding interaction network freezes. By modifying
the epigenetic read-write process according to more biologically-inspired
assumptions, our polymer model with recolouring recapitulates the
ultrasensitive response of epigenetic switches to perturbations, and accounts
for multi-domain conformations, strikingly similar to the
topologically-associating-domains observed in eukaryotic chromosomes.

  Brain Networks During Ketamine-Medetomidine Anesthetic Induction"	"  One of the central questions in neuroscience is to understand the way
communication is organized in the brain, trying to comprehend how cognitive
capacities or physiological states of the organism are potentially related to
brain activities involving interactions of several brain areas. One important
characteristic of the functional brain networks is that they are modularly
structured, being this modular architecture regarded to account for a series of
properties and functional dynamics. In the neurobiological context, communities
may indicate brain regions that are involved in one same activity, representing
neural segregated processes. Several studies have demonstrated the modular
character of organization of brain activities. However, empirical evidences
regarding to its dynamics and relation to different levels of consciousness
have not been reported yet. Within this context, this research sought to
characterize the community structure of functional brain networks during an
anesthetic induction process. The experiment was based on intra-cranial
recordings of neural activities of an old world macaque of the species Macaca
fuscata during a Ketamine-Medetomidine anesthetic induction process. Networks
were serially estimated in time intervals of five seconds. Changes were
observed within about one and a half minutes after the administration of the
anesthetics, revealing the occurrence of a transition on the community
structure. The awake state was characterized by the presence of large clusters
involving frontal and parietal regions, while the anesthetized state by the
presence of communities in the primary visual and motor cortices, being the
areas of the secondary associative cortex most affected. The results report the
influence of general anesthesia on the structure of functional clusters,
contributing for understanding some new aspects of neural correlates of
consciousness.

  non-intrusive microfluidic-based approach"	"  A method combining video imaging in parallel microchannels with a
semi-empirical mathematical model provides non-intrusive, high-throughput
measurements of time-varying biofilm viscosity. The approach is demonstrated
for early growth Pseudomonas sp. biofilms exposed to constant flow streams of
nutrient solutions with different ionic strengths. The ability to measure
viscosities at early growth stages, without inducing a shear-thickening
response, enabled measurements that are among the lowest reported to date. In
addition, good time resolution enabled the detection of a rapid thickening
phase, which occurred at different times after the exponential growth phase
finished, depending on the ionic strength. The technique opens the way for a
combinatorial approach to beter understand the complex dynamical response of
biofilm mechanical properties under well-controlled physical, chemical and
biological growth conditions and time-limited perturbations.

1606.04876	q-bio	q-bio.NC cs.OH	On the optimality of grid cells	"  Grid cells, discovered more than a decade ago [5], are neurons in the brain
of mammals that fire when the animal is located near certain specific points in
its familiar terrain. Intriguingly, these points form, for a single cell, a
two-dimensional triangular grid, not unlike our Figure 3. Grid cells are widely
believed to be involved in path integration, that is, the maintenance of a
location state through the summation of small displacements. We provide
theoretical evidence for this assertion by showing that cells with grid-like
tuning curves are indeed well adapted for the path integration task. In
particular we prove that, in one dimension under Gaussian noise, the
sensitivity of measuring small displacements is maximized by a population of
neurons whose tuning curves are near-sinusoids -- that is to say, with peaks
forming a one-dimensional grid. We also show that effective computation of the
displacement is possible through a second population of cells whose sinusoid
tuning curves are in phase difference from the first. In two dimensions, under
additional assumptions it can be shown that measurement sensitivity is
optimized by the product of two sinusoids, again yielding a grid-like pattern.
We discuss the connection of our results to the triangular grid pattern
observed in animals.

donations conditional on knowing the gender of the dictator. Our data provide
evidence of three main findings: (i) women are expected to be more altruist
than men; (ii) both men and women have correct beliefs about the level of
altruism among men; and (iii) both men and women overestimate the level of
altruism among women. In doing so, our results uncover a perception gap
according to which, although women are more altruist than men, they are
expected to be even more altruist than they actually are.

general application model is laid down which relates city-growth rates to
initial inhabitants and to exosomatic energy increment, the deviations from it
showing order in space and time; as shown in a series of maps which hint at

same physical event into a coherent percept? One possibility is that observers
rely on information across perceptual modalities that shares temporal structure
and/or semantic associations. To explore the contributions of these two factors
in multisensory integration, we manipulated the temporal and semantic
relationships between auditory and visual information produced by real-world
events, such as paper tearing or cards being shuffled. We identified distinct
neural substrates for integration based on temporal structure as compared to
integration based on event semantics. Semantically incongruent events recruited
left frontal regions, while temporally asynchronous events recruited right
frontal cortices. At the same time, both forms of incongruence recruited
subregions in the temporal, occipital, and lingual cortices. Finally, events
that were both temporally and semantically congruent modulated activity in the
parahippocampus and anterior temporal lobe. Taken together, these results
indicate that low-level perceptual properties such as temporal synchrony and
high-level knowledge such as semantics play a role in our coherent perceptual
experience of physical events.

report a process for generating 3D human model stimuli that combines commonly
used graphics software and enables the flexible generation of animated human
models while providing parametric control over individualized identity
features. Our approach creates novel head models using FaceGen Modeller,
attaches them to commercially-purchased 3D avatar bodies in 3D Studio Max, and
generates Cal3D human models that are compatible with many virtual 3D
environments. Stimuli produced by this method can be embedded as animated 3D
avatars in interactive simulations or presented as 2D images embedded in scenes
for use in traditional laboratory experiments. The inherent flexibility in this
method makes the stimuli applicable to a broad range of basic and applied
research questions in the domain of person perception. We describe the steps of
the stimulus generation process, provide an example of their use in a
recognition memory paradigm, and highlight the adaptability of the method for
related avenues of research.

the specific method used, and the limitation encountered by most techniques to
capture fast movements in a crowded environment. Other approaches to identify
the mode and rapidity of motion of fluorescently labeled biomolecules, that do
not relay on the localization and linking of the images of isolated single
molecules are, however, available.This direct comparison shows that correlative
imaging analysis approaches complement effectively current SMT methods in
circumstances when, due to either the density of the sample, the low signal to

also including degenerate parameter cases. Due to recent progress for the
continuous time case via the identification of an underlying stochastic

how to do it, and how to extend the approach to the discrete-time case as well.

target structures. The self-assembly of designed artificial heteropolymers is
still, to the best of our knowledge, not possible with control over the single
chain self-assembling properties comparable to what natural proteins can
achieve. What artificial heteropolymers lacks compared to bio-heteropolymers
that grants the latter such a versatility? Is the geometry of the protein
skeleton the only a particular choice to be designable? Here we introduce a
general criteria to discriminate which polymer backbones can be designed to
adopt a predetermined structure. With our approach we can explore different
polymer backbones and different amino acids alphabets. By comparing the radial
distribution functions of designable and not-designable scenarios we identify
as designability criteria the presence of a particular peak in the radial
distribution function that dominates over the random packing of the
heteropolymer. We show that the peak is a universal feature of all designable
heteropolymers, as it is dominating also the radial distribution function of
natural proteins. Our finding can help in understanding the key features that
make proteins a highly designable system. The criteria that we present can be
applied to engineer new types of self-assembling modular polymers that will
open new applications for polymer based material science.

unexplored, one might speculate that reversed native protein sequences should
be significantly more foldable than purely random heteropolymer sequences. In
this article, we investigate how the reverse-sequences of native proteins might
fold by examining a series of small proteins of increasing structural
complexity ({\alpha}-helix, \b{eta}-hairpin, {\alpha}-helix bundle, and
{\alpha}/\b{eta}-protein). Employing a tandem protein structure prediction
algorithmic and molecular dynamics simulation approach, we find that the
ability of reverse sequences to adopt native-like folds is strongly in
influenced by protein size and the flexibility of the native hydrophobic core.
For \b{eta}-hairpins with reverse-sequences that fail to fold, we employ a
simple mutational strategy for guiding stable hairpin formation that involves
the insertion of amino acids into the \b{eta}-turn region. This systematic look
at reverse sequence duality sheds new light on the problem of protein
sequence-structure mapping and may serve to inspire new protein design and
protein structure prediction protocols.

1606.05428	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio.SC	"How does a protein reach its binding locus: sliding along DNA chain or
  not?"	"  In gene expression, various kinds of proteins need to bind to specific locus
of DNA. It is still not clear how these proteins find their target locus. In
this study, the mean first-passage time (FPT) of protein binding to its target
locus on DNA chain is discussed by a chain-space coupled model. Our results
show that the 1-dimensional diffusion constant has a critical value, with which
the mean time spent by a protein to find its target locus is almost independent
of the binding rate of protein to DNA chain and the detachment rate from DNA
chain. Which implies that, the frequency of protein binding to DNA and the
sliding time on DNA chain have little influence on the search efficiency, and
therefore whether or not the 1-dimensional sliding on DNA chain increases the
search efficiency depends on the 1-dimensional diffusion constant of the
protein on DNA chain. This study also finds that only protein bindings to DNA
loci which are close to the target locus help to increase the search
efficiency, while bindings to those loci which are far from the target locus
might delay the target binding process. As expected, the mean FPT increases
with the distance between the initial position of protein in cell space and its
target locus on DNA chain. The direct binding probability, which can be
regarded as one index to describe if the 1-dimensional sliding along DNA chain
is helpful to increase the search efficiency is calculated. Our results show
that the influence of 1-dimensional sliding along DNA chain on the search
process depends on both diffusion constants of protein in cell space and on the
1-dimensional DNA chain.

parameter settings, which are often problem-specific. Automated schemes for
parameter tuning have been developed to alleviate the high costs of manual
parameter tuning. Experimental results indicate that self-adaptation, where
parameter settings are encoded in the genomes of individuals, can be effective
in continuous optimisation. However, results in discrete optimisation have been
less conclusive. Furthermore, a rigorous runtime analysis that explains how
self-adaptation can lead to asymptotic speedups has been missing. This paper
provides the first such analysis for discrete, population-based EAs. We apply
level-based analysis to show how a self-adaptive EA is capable of fine-tuning
its mutation rate, leading to exponential speedups over EAs using fixed
mutation rates.

show how this can be achieved in an unsupervised generative model by applying
the same learning pressures as have been suggested to act in the ventral visual
stream in the brain. By enforcing redundancy reduction, encouraging statistical
independence, and exposure to data with transform continuities analogous to
those to which human infants are exposed, we obtain a variational autoencoder
(VAE) framework capable of learning disentangled factors. Our approach makes
few assumptions and works well across a wide variety of datasets. Furthermore,
our solution has useful emergent properties, such as zero-shot inference and an
intuitive understanding of ""objectness"".

Combining our deep learning system's predictions with the human pathologist's

useful model organisms for understanding the evolution of animal
multicellularity. An important factor in animal evolution was the increasing
ocean oxygen levels in the Precambrian, which are thought to have influenced
the emergence of complex multicellular life. As a first step in addressing
these conditions, we study here the response of the colony-forming
choanoflagellate $Salpingoeca~rosetta$ to oxygen gradients. Using a
microfluidic device that allows spatio-temporal variations in oxygen
concentrations, we report the discovery that $S.~rosetta$ display positive
aerotaxis. Analysis of the spatial population distributions provides evidence
for logarithmic sensing of oxygen, which enhances sensing in low oxygen
neighborhoods. Analysis of search strategy models on the experimental colony
trajectories finds that choanoflagellate aerotaxis is consistent with
stochastic navigation, the statistics of which are captured using an effective
continuous version based on classical run-and-tumble chemotaxis.

a single limiting resource coexist is a challenging issue within a theoretical
perspective. Previous investigations rely on mechanisms such as group or
spatial structuring to achieve a stable coexistence between competing metabolic
strategies. Nevertheless, coexistence has been experimentally reported even in
situations where it cannot be attributed to spatial effects [Heredity {\bf
100}, 471 (2008)]. According to that study a toxin expelled by one of the
strains can be responsible for the stable maintenance of the two strain types.
We propose a resource-based model in which an efficient strain with a slow
metabolic rate competes with a second strain type which presents a fast but
inefficient metabolism. Moreover, the model assumes that the inefficient strain
produces a toxin as a byproduct. This toxin affects the growth rate of both
strains with different strength. Through an extensive exploration of the
parameter space we determine the situations at which the coexistence of the two
strains is possible. Interestingly, we observe that the resource influx rate
plays a key role in the maintenance of the two strain types. In a scenario of
resource scarcity the inefficient is favored, though as the resource influx
rate is augmented the coexistence becomes possible and its domain is enlarged.

present a model for constructing a median of three genomes in this family-free
setting, based on maximizing an objective function that generalizes the
classical breakpoint distance by integrating sequence similarity in the score
of a gene adjacency. We show that the corresponding computational problem is

result of our FF-median program is a median genome with median genes associated
to extant genes, in which median adjacencies are assumed to define positional

  coefficient in ancient DNA"	"  Time-series of allele frequencies are a useful and unique set of data to
determine the strength of natural selection on the background of genetic drift.
Technically, the selection coefficient is estimated by means of a likelihood
function built under the hypothesis that the available trajectory spans a
sufficiently large portion of the fitness landscape. Especially for ancient
DNA, however, often only one single such trajectories is available and the
coverage of the fitness landscape is very limited. In fact, one single
trajectory is more representative of a process conditioned both in the initial
and in the final condition than of a process free to visit the available
fitness landscape. Based on two models of population genetics, here we show how
to build a likelihood function for the selection coefficient that takes the
statistical peculiarity of single trajectories into account. We show that this
conditional likelihood delivers a precise estimate of the selection coefficient
also when allele frequencies are close to fixation whereas the unconditioned
likelihood fails. Finally, we discuss the fact that the traditional,
unconditioned likelihood always delivers an answer, which is often
unfalsifiable and appears reasonable also when it is not correct.

microfluidic device for diffusion-based gradient generation for cellular
assays. A unique channel design of the device eliminates cross-flow between the
source and sink channels, thereby stabilising gradients by passive diffusion.
The platform also enables quick and flexible control of chemical concentration
that makes highly dynamic gradients in diffusion chambers. A model with the
first approximation of diffusion and surface adsorption of molecules

cultured in a gradient of a chemical inducer expressed a reporter fluorescence

  The input for distance-based inference methods is an element of a Euclidean

algorithms there exists a subdivision of this space into polyhedral cones such
that inputs in the same cone return the same tree topology. The geometry of
these cones has been used to analyze the inference algorithms. In this chapter,
we model how input data points drawn from DNA sequences are distributed
throughout Euclidean space in relation to the space of tree metrics, which in
turn can also be described as a collection of polyhedral cones.

  Interpretation of Polynomial Contrasts"	"  Task based neuroimaging tools for the study of cognitive neuroscience provide
insight into understanding how the brain responds to increasing cognitive
demand. Theoretical models of neural-cognitive relationships have been
developed based on observations of linear and non-linear increases in brain
activity. Neural efficiency and capacity are two parameters of current
theoretical models. These two theoretical parameters describe the rate of
increase of brain activity and the upper limits of the increases, respectively.
The current work demonstrates that a quadratic model of increasing brain
activity in response to the n-back task is a solution to a differential
equation model. This reinterpretation of a standard approach to analyzing a
common cognitive task provides a wealth of new insight. The results include
brain wide measures of neural efficiency and capacity. The quantification of
neural-cognitive relationships provides evidence to support current cognitive
neuroscience theories. In addition, the methods provide a framework for
understanding the neural mechanisms of working memory. This allows estimation
of the effects of experimental manipulations within a conceptual research

investigate the effect of scan length on reliability of resting-state
functional connectivity (rsFC) estimates produced from resting-state functional
magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). Additionally, we study the benefits of
empirical Bayes shrinkage, in which subject-level estimates borrow strength
from the population average by trading a small increase in bias for a greater
reduction in variance. For each subject, we compute raw and shrinkage estimates
of rsFC between 300 regions identified through independent components analysis
(ICA) based on rsfMRI scans varying from 3 to 30 minutes in length. The time
course for each region is determined using dual regression, and rsFC is
estimated as the Pearson correlation between each pair of time courses.
Shrinkage estimates for each subject are computed as a weighted average between
the raw subject-level estimate and the population average estimate, where the
weight is determined for each connection by the relationship of within-subject
variance to between-subject variance. We find that shrinkage estimates exhibit
greater reliability than raw estimates for most connections, with 30-40%
improvement using scans less than 10 minutes in length and 10-20% improvement
using scans of 20-30 minutes. We also observe significant spatial variability
in reliability of both raw and shrinkage estimates, with connections within the
default mode and motor networks exhibiting the greatest reliability and
between-network connections exhibiting the poorest reliability. We conclude
that the scan length required for reliable estimation of rsFC depends on the
specific connections of interest, and shrinkage can be used to increase
reliability of rsFC, even when produced from long, high-quality rsfMRI scans.

emergence of new pathogens such as Powassan virus, understanding what
distinguishes vector from non-vector species, and predicting undiscovered tick
vectors is an important step towards mitigating human disease risk. We apply
generalized boosted regression to interrogate over 90 features for over 240
species of Ixodes ticks. Our model predicted vector status with ~97% accuracy
and implicated 14 tick species whose intrinsic trait profiles confer high
probabilities (~80%) that they are capable of transmitting infections from
animal hosts to humans. Distinguishing characteristics of zoonotic tick vectors
include several anatomical structures that facilitate efficient host seeking
and blood-feeding from a wide variety of host species. Boosted regression
analysis produced both actionable predictions to guide ongoing surveillance as
well as testable hypotheses about the biological underpinnings of vectorial
capacity across tick species.

  stochastic spiking neurons"	"  Phase transitions and critical behavior are crucial issues both in
theoretical and experimental neuroscience. We report analytic and computational
results about phase transitions and self-organized criticality (SOC) in
networks with general stochastic neurons. The stochastic neuron has a firing
probability given by a smooth monotonic function $\Phi(V)$ of the membrane
potential $V$, rather than a sharp firing threshold. We find that such networks
can operate in several dynamic regimes (phases) depending on the average
synaptic weight and the shape of the firing function $\Phi$. In particular, we
encounter both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions to absorbing
states. At the continuous transition critical boundary, neuronal avalanches
occur whose distributions of size and duration are given by power laws, as
observed in biological neural networks. We also propose and test a new
mechanism to produce SOC: the use of dynamic neuronal gains -- a form of
short-term plasticity probably in the axon initial segment (AIS) -- instead of
depressing synapses at the dendrites (as previously studied in the literature).
The new self-organization mechanism produces a slightly supercritical state,
that we called SOSC, in accord to some intuitions of Alan Turing.

accurate predictions and their weight maps are interpretable as they focus on a
small number of regions. However, the state of the art, based on total
variation or graph-net, is computationally costly. Here we introduce sparsity
in the local neighborhood of each voxel with social-sparsity, a structured
shrinkage operator. We find that, on brain imaging classification problems,
social-sparsity performs almost as well as total-variation models and better
than graph-net, for a fraction of the computational cost. It also very clearly
outlines predictive regions. We give details of the model and the algorithm.

1606.06443	q-bio	q-bio.NC cs.NE	An active efficient coding model of the optokinetic nystagmus	"  Optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) is an involuntary eye movement responsible for
stabilizing retinal images in the presence of relative motion between an
observer and the environment. Fully understanding the development of
optokinetic nystagmus requires a neurally plausible computational model that
accounts for the neural development and the behavior. To date, work in this
area has been limited. We propose a neurally plausible framework for the joint
development of disparity and motion tuning in the visual cortex, the
optokinetic and vergence eye movements. This framework models the joint
emergence of both perception and behavior, and accounts for the importance of
the development of normal vergence control and binocular vision in achieving
normal monocular OKN (mOKN) behaviors. Because the model includes behavior, we
can simulate the same perturbations as performed in past experiments, such as
artificially induced strabismus. The proposed model agrees both qualitatively
and quantitatively with a number of findings from the literature on both
binocular vision as well as the optokinetic reflex. Finally, our model also
makes quantitative predictions about the OKN behavior using the same methods
used to characterize the OKN in the experimental literature.

fundamental constraints imposed by the physics of negative group delay. To test
this hypothesis, the results of an experiment in which subjects demonstrate
both reactive and predictive dynamics are modeled by a linear system with
delay-induced negative group delay. Although one of the simplest real-time
predictors conceivable, this model explains key components of experimental
observations. Most notably, it explains the observation that prediction time
linearly increases with feedback delay, up to a certain point when tracking
performance deteriorates. It also explains the transition from reactive to
predictive behavior with increasing feedback delay. The model contains only one
free parameter, the feedback gain, which has been fixed by comparison with one
set of experimental observations for the reactive case. Our model provides
quantitative predictions that can be tested in further experiments.

1606.06668	q-bio	q-bio.MN	"Competitive binding of transcription factors drives Mendelian dominance
  in regulatory genetic pathways"	"  We report a new mechanism for allelic dominance in regulatory genetic
interactions that we call binding dominance. We investigated a biophysical
model of gene regulation, where the fractional occupancy of a transcription
factor (TF) on the cis-regulated promoter site it binds to is determined by
binding energy (-{\Delta}G) and TF dosage. Transcription and gene expression
proceed when the TF is bound to the promoter. In diploids, individuals may be
heterozygous at the cis-site, at the TF's coding region, or at the TF's own
promoter, which determines allele-specific dosage. We find that when the TF's
coding region is heterozygous, TF alleles compete for occupancy at the cis
sites and the tighter-binding TF is dominant in proportion to the difference in
binding strength. When the TF's own promoter is heterozygous, the TF produced
at the higher dosage is also dominant. Cis-site heterozygotes have additive
expression and therefore codominant phenotypes. Binding dominance propagates to
affect the expression of downstream loci and it is sensitive in both magnitude
and direction to genetic background, but its detectability often attenuates.
While binding dominance is inevitable at the molecular level, it is difficult
to detect in the phenotype under some biophysical conditions, more so when TF
dosage is high and allele-specific binding affinities are similar. A body of
empirical research on the biophysics of TF binding demonstrates the
plausibility of this mechanism of dominance, but studies of gene expression
under competitive binding in heterozygotes in a diversity of genetic
backgrounds are needed.

asynchrony and heterogeneity, the origins of which remain unclear. Here, we
formally study how telomere shortening mechanisms impact on senescence kinetics
and define two regimes of senescence, depending on the initial telomere length
variance. We provide analytical solutions to the model, highlighting a
non-linear relationship between senescence onset and initial telomere length

telomeres as they shorten, leading to senescence heterogeneity.

1606.07029	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Sparse convolutional coding for neuronal ensemble identification	"  Cell ensembles, originally proposed by Donald Hebb in 1949, are subsets of
synchronously firing neurons and proposed to explain basic firing behavior in
the brain. Despite having been studied for many years no conclusive evidence
has been presented yet for their existence and involvement in information
processing such that their identification is still a topic of modern research,
especially since simultaneous recordings of large neuronal population have
become possible in the past three decades. These large recordings pose a
challenge for methods allowing to identify individual neurons forming cell
ensembles and their time course of activity inside the vast amounts of spikes
recorded. Related work so far focused on the identification of purely simulta-
neously firing neurons using techniques such as Principal Component Analysis.
In this paper we propose a new algorithm based on sparse convolution coding
which is also able to find ensembles with temporal structure. Application of
our algorithm to synthetically generated datasets shows that it outperforms
previous work and is able to accurately identify temporal cell ensembles even
when those contain overlapping neurons or when strong background noise is
present.

three and four taxa. If the probability spaces between one tree or network and
another are not identical then there will be phylogenetic tensors that could
have arisen on one but not the other. We call these two trees or networks
distinguishable from each other. We show that for the binary symmetric model
there are no two-taxon trees and networks that are distinguishable from each
other, however there are three-taxon trees and networks that are
distinguishable from each other.
  We compare the time parameters for the phylogenetic tensors for various taxon
label permutations on a given tree or network. If the time parameters on one
taxon label permutation in terms of the other taxon label permutation are all
non-negative then we say that the two taxon label permutations are not network
identifiable from each other. We show that some taxon label permutations are
network identifiable from each other.
  We show that some four-taxon networks satisfy the four-point condition. Of
the two ""shapes"" of four-taxon rooted trees, one is defined by the cluster,
b,c,d, labelling taxa alphabetically from left to right. The network with this
shape and convergence between the two taxa with the root as their most recent
common ancestor satisfies the four-point condition.
  The phylogenetic tensors contain polynomial equations that cannot be easily
solved for four-taxon or higher trees or networks. We show how methods from
algebraic geometry, such as Gr\""obner bases, can be used to solve the
polynomial equations. We show that some four-taxon trees and networks can be
distinguished from each other.

particularly relevant to the study of DNA packaging in viruses. A reduced
version of the problem based on coarse-grained representations of the main
components of the system -- the DNA polymer and the spherical viral capsid --
has been studied by molecular dynamics simulation. The results, involving
longer polymers than in earlier work, show that as polymers become more rigid
there is an increasing tendency to self-organize as spools that wrap from the
inside out, rather than the inverse direction seen previously. In the final
state, a substantial part of the polymer is packed into one or more coaxial
spools, concentrically layered with different orientations, a form of packaging
achievable without twisting the polymer.

1606.07269	q-bio	q-bio.BM q-bio.SC	"Stochastic models of the binding kinetics of VEGF-A to VEGFR1 and VEGFR2
  in endothelial cells"	"  Vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) are receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs) that regulate proliferation, migration, angiogenesis and
vascular permeability of endothelial cells. VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 bind vascular
endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), inducing receptor dimerisation and
activation, characterised by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in their
cytoplasmic domain. Although experimental evidence suggests that RTK signalling
occurs both on the plasma membrane and intra-cellularly, and reveals the role
of endocytosis in RTK signal transduction, we still lack knowledge of VEGFR
phosphorylation-site use and of the spatiotemporal regulation of VEGFR
signalling. In this paper, we introduce four stochastic mathematical models to
study the binding kinetics of vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF-A to
VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, and phosphorylation. The formation of phosphorylated dimers
on the cell surface is a two-step process: diffusive transport and binding. The
first two of our models only consider VEGFR2, which allows us to introduce new
stochastic descriptors making use of a matrix-analytic approach. The two
remaining models describe the competition of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 for ligand
availability, and are analysed making use of Gillespie simulations and the van
Kampen approximation. Under the hypothesis that bound phosphorylated receptor
dimers are the signalling units, we study the time to reach a threshold number
of such complexes. Our results indicate that the presence of VEGFR1 does not
only affect the timescale to reach a given signalling threshold, but it also
affects the maximum attainable threshold. This result is consistent with the
conjectured role of VEGFR1 as a decoy receptor, that prevents VEGF-A binding to
VEGFR2, and thus, VEGFR2 attaining suitable phosphorylation levels. We identify
an optimum range of ligand concentration for sustained dimer phosphorylation.

1606.07350	q-bio	q-bio.PE	In the Light of Deep Coalescence: Revisiting Trees Within Networks	"  Phylogenetic networks model reticulate evolutionary histories. The last two
decades have seen an increased interest in establishing mathematical results
and developing computational methods for inferring and analyzing these
networks. A salient concept underlying a great majority of these developments
has been the notion that a network displays a set of trees and those trees can
be used to infer, analyze, and study the network.
  In this paper, we show that in the presence of coalescence effects, the set
of displayed trees is not sufficient to capture the network. We formally define
the set of parental trees of a network and make three contributions based on
this definition. First, we extend the notion of anomaly zone to phylogenetic
networks and report on anomaly results for different networks. Second, we
demonstrate how coalescence events could negatively affect the ability to infer
a species tree that could be augmented into the correct network. Third, we
demonstrate how a phylogenetic network can be viewed as a mixture model that
lends itself to a novel inference approach via gene tree clustering.
  Our results demonstrate the limitations of focusing on the set of trees
displayed by a network when analyzing and inferring the network. Our findings
can form the basis for achieving higher accuracy when inferring phylogenetic
networks and open up new venues for research in this area, including new
problem formulations based on the notion of a network's parental trees.

cognitive decline, independent of strokes. Several mechanisms have been
proposed to explain this association, but altered cerebral blood flow dynamics
during AF has been poorly investigated: in particular, it is unknown how AF
influences hemodynamic parameters of the distal cerebral circulation, at the
arteriolar and capillary level. Two coupled lumped-parameter models (systemic
and cerebrovascular circulations, respectively) were here used to simulate
sinus rhythm (SR) and AF. For each simulation 5000 cardiac cycles were analyzed
and cerebral hemodynamic parameters were calculated. With respect to SR, AF
triggered a higher variability of the cerebral hemodynamic variables which
increases proceeding towards the distal circulation, reaching the maximum
extent at the arteriolar and capillary levels. This variability led to critical
cerebral hemodynamic events of excessive pressure or reduced blood flow: 303
hypoperfusions occurred at the arteriolar level, while 387 hypertensive events
occurred at the capillary level during AF. By contrast, neither hypoperfusions
nor hypertensive events occurred during SR. Thus, the impact of AF per se on
cerebral hemodynamics candidates as a relevant mechanism into the genesis of
AF-related cognitive impairment/dementia.

assumptions about how the disease spreads, such as uniform transmissibility and
homogeneous mixing within a population. In this paper, we test whether these
assumptions are necessarily correct, and offer simple solutions that may
improve disease model accuracy. First, we use data and models of West African
migration to show that EVD does not homogeneously mix, but spreads in a
predictable manner. Next, we estimate the initial growth rate of EVD within
country administrative divisions and find that it significantly decreases with
population density. Finally, we test whether EVD strains have uniform

against a non-rigid obstacle, in presence of an external load. The filaments
polymerize by either moving the whole obstacle, with a large energy cost, or by
causing local distortion in its shape which costs much less energy. The
non-rigid obstacle also has local thermal fluctuations due to which its shape
can change with time and we describe this using fluctuations in the height
profile of a one dimensional interface with Kardar-Parisi-Zhang dynamics. We
find the shape fluctuations of the barrier strongly affects the force
generation mechanism. The qualitative nature of the force-velocity curve is
crucially determined by the relative time-scale of filament and barrier
dynamics. The height profile of the barrier also shows interesting variation
with the external load. Our analytical calculation within mean-field theory

of wound healing, and the formation of tumors. By mimicking the mechanical
motion of calls crawling on a substrate using a pseudopod, we constructed a
minimal model for migrating cells which gives rise to contact inhibition of
locomotion (CIL) naturally. The model cell consists of two disks, one in the
front (a pseudopod) and the other one in the back (cell body), connected by a
finitely extensible spring. Despite the simplicity of the model, the cells'
collective behavior is highly nontrivial, depending on the shape of cells and
whether CIL is enabled or not. Cells with a small front circle (i.e. a narrow
pseudopod) form immobile colonies. In contrast, cells with a large front circle
(i.e. such as a lamellipodium) exhibit coherent migration without any explicit
alignment mechanism being present in the model. This suggests that crawling
cells often exhibit broad fronts because it helps them avoid clustering. Upon
increasing the density, the cells develop density waves which propagate against
the direction of cell migration and finally arrest at higher densities.

population. Techniques such as diaries or proximity sensors allow to collect
data about encounters and to build networks of contacts between individuals.
The contact networks obtained from these different techniques are however
quantitatively different. Here, we first show how these discrepancies affect
the prediction of the epidemic risk when these data are fed to numerical models
of epidemic spread: low participation rate, under-reporting of contacts and
overestimation of contact durations in contact diaries with respect to sensor
data determine indeed important differences in the outcomes of the
corresponding simulations {with for instance an enhanced sensitivity to initial
conditions}. Most importantly, we investigate if and how information gathered
from contact diaries can be used in such simulations in order to yield an
accurate description of the epidemic risk, assuming that data from sensors
represent the ground truth. The contact networks built from contact sensors and
diaries present indeed several structural similarities: this suggests the
possibility to construct, using only the contact diary network information, a
surrogate contact network such that simulations using this surrogate network
give the same estimation of the epidemic risk as simulations using the contact
sensor network. We present and {compare} several methods to build such
surrogate data, and show that it is indeed possible to obtain a good agreement
between the outcomes of simulations using surrogate and sensor data, as long as
the contact diary information is complemented by publicly available data
describing the heterogeneity of the durations of human contacts.

the sea shell powder using soak and dry method. Different concentrations of
drug solution was made in ethanol and water. The shell powder was soaked in
drug solutions and was kept soaking for 48 hrs with intermittent
ultrasonication. The mixture was gently dried in a vacuum oven. The in vitro
drug release studies were done using Phosphate Buffered Saline. The FESEM
images displayed a distribution of differently sized and shaped particles. The
sea shells due to its natural porosity and crystallinity are expected to be
useful for drug delivery. About 50% drug entrapment efficiency for aspirin and
39% for strontium ranelate was seen. A burst release of the drug (80 percent)
was observed within two hours for both the drugs studied. Rest of the drug was

during spindle formation, an important process for accurate chromosome
segregation during cell division. Recent work has found that microtubule
rotational diffusion about minus-end attachment points contributes to
kinetochore capture in fission yeast, but the relative contributions of dynamic
instability and rotational diffusion are not well understood. We have developed
a biophysical model of kinetochore capture in small fission-yeast nuclei using
hybrid Brownian dynamics/kinetic Monte Carlo simulation techniques. With this
model, we have studied the importance of dynamic instability and microtubule
rotational diffusion for kinetochore capture, both to the lateral surface of a
microtubule and at or near its end. Over a range of biologically relevant
parameters, microtubule rotational diffusion decreased capture time, but made a
relatively small contribution compared to dynamic instability. At most,
rotational diffusion reduced capture time by 25%. Our results suggest that
while microtubule rotational diffusion can speed up kinetochore capture, it is
unlikely to be the dominant physical mechanism. In addition, we found that when
microtubules undergo dynamic instability, lateral captures predominate even in
the absence of rotational diffusion. Counterintuitively, adding rotational
diffusion to a dynamic microtubule increases the probability of end-on capture.

bio-medical domains ranging from developing effective medicines for tumors and
for viral diseases to developing attenuated virus strains that can be used for
vaccination. Here, we study the problem of down regulation of mRNA translation
using a mathematical model called the ribosome flow model (RFM). In the RFM,
the mRNA molecule is modeled as a chain of $n$ sites. The flow of ribosomes
between consecutive sites is regulated by $n+1$ transition rates. Given a set
of feasible transition rates, that models the outcome of all possible
mutations, we consider the problem of maximally down regulating the translation
rate by altering the rates within this set of feasible rates. Under certain
conditions on the feasible set, we show that an optimal solution can be
determined efficiently. We also rigorously analyze two special cases of the
down regulation optimization problem. Our results suggest that one must focus
on the position along the mRNA molecule where the transition rate has the
strongest effect on the protein production rate. However, this rate is not
necessarily the slowest transition rate along the mRNA molecule. We discuss
some of the biological implications of these results.

different base-pair and stacking energies. We use exact calculation, within the
model, of the Helmholtz free-energy of any partial denaturation state, which
implies that the entropy of all formed bubbles (""loops"") is accounted for.
Considering base-pair bond removal single events, the bond designated for
opening is chosen by minimizing the free-energy difference for the process,
over all remaining base-pair bonds. Despite of its great simplicity, for
several known DNA sequences our results are in accord with available
theoretical and experimental studies. Moreover, we report free-energy profiles
along the denaturation pathway, which allow to detect stable or meta-stable
partial denaturation states, composed of ""bubbles"", as local free-energy minima
separated by barriers. Our approach allows to study very long DNA strands with
commonly available computational power, as we demonstrate for a few random

  Chikungunya and Zika"	"  Aedes aegypti is a known vector of Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika and the goal
of this study is to propose the first mathematical model to describe the
dynamic transmission of these three diseases. We present two preliminary models
that consist of the SEIR model for the human populations and an SEI model for
the vector to describe (a) the single transmission dynamics of dengue,
Chikungunya or Zika, and (b) any possible coinfection between two diseases in
the same population. In order to do that, we obtain an analytical solution of
the system of 17 and 30 coupled differential equations for each model
respectively, and later obtain the eigenvalues by analyzing the Jacobian matrix
in order to begin the development of a surveillance system to prevent the
spread of these three diseases.

  biochemical reaction models"	"  The development of mechanistic models of biological systems is a central part
of Systems Biology. One major task in developing these models is the inference
of the correct model parameters. Due to the size of most realistic models and
their possibly complex dynamical behaviour one must usually rely on sample
based methods. In this paper we present a novel algorithm that reliably
estimates model parameters for deterministic as well as stochastic models from
trajectory data. Our algorithm samples iteratively independent particles from
the level sets of the likelihood and recovers the posterior from these level
sets. The presented approach is easily parallelizable and, by utilizing density
estimation through Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Models, can deal with
high dimensional parameter spaces. We illustrate that our algorithm is
applicable to large, realistic deterministic and stochastic models and succeeds
in inferring the correct posterior from a given number of observed
trajectories. This algorithm presents a novel, computationally feasible
approach to identify parameters of large biochemical reaction models based on
sample path data.

  Monte Carlo analysis"	"  Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) chips are widely used to measure association
and dissociation rates for the binding kinetics between two species of
chemicals, e.g., cell receptors and ligands. It is commonly assumed that
ligands are spatially well mixed in the SPR region, and hence a mean-field rate
equation description is appropriate. This approximation however ignores the
spatial fluctuations as well as temporal correlations induced by multiple local
rebinding events, which become prominent for slow diffusion rates and high
binding affinities. We report detailed Monte Carlo simulations of ligand
binding kinetics in an SPR cell subject to laminar flow. We extract the binding
and dissociation rates by means of the techniques frequently employed in
experimental analysis that are motivated by the mean-field approximation. We
find major discrepancies in a wide parameter regime between the thus extracted
rates and the known input simulation values. These results underscore the
crucial quantitative importance of spatio-temporal correlations in binary
reaction kinetics in SPR cell geometries, and demonstrate the failure of a
mean-field analysis of SPR cells in the regime of high Damk\""ohler number Da >
0.1, where the spatio-temporal correlations due to diffusive transport and
ligand-receptor rebinding events dominate the dynamics of SPR systems.

information theory, researchers have attempted to quantify the extent to which
a complex dynamical system presents a balance of integrated and segregated

showing that the system of oscillators in question exhibits a critical peak of
integrated information that coincides with peaks in other measures such as
metastability and coalition entropy.

of a noradrenaline-stimulated adenylyl cyclase with DNA unzipping. Specific
proteins condition cAMP insertion in specific sites of the DNA structure to
direct cellular and synaptic differentiation in brain tissues, also providing
coding. Metabolic-dependent ATP binding of Mg2+, could control feedback by
inactivating AC dependent formation of cAMP. The level of cAMP and cGMP, which
could be assayed in red cells and cerebrospinal fluid, allows a clinical lab
diagnostic improvement. Also, provides a relationship of best fitting to cAMP
control by binding to DNA. The cAMP level allows the prediction of an inverse
relationship between neurodegeneration and cancer. The latter, could be
characterized by uncontrolled proliferation, whereas metabolic dominance by
stress over a long period of time, may deplete cerebral cAMP.

  reefs"	"  Coral reefs are dynamic systems whose composition is highly influenced by
unpredictable biotic and abiotic factors. Understanding the spatial scale at
which long-term predictions of reef composition can be made will be crucial for
guiding conservation efforts. Using a 22-year time series of benthic
composition data from 20 reefs on the Kenyan and Tanzanian coast, we studied
the long-term behaviour of Bayesian vector autoregressive state-space models
for reef dynamics, incorporating among-site variability. We estimate that if
there were no among-site variability, the total long-term variability would be
approximately one third of its current value. Thus among-site variability
contributes more to long-term variability in reef composition than does
temporal variability. Individual sites are more predictable than previously
thought, and predictions based on current snapshots are informative about
long-term properties. Our approach allowed us to identify a subset of possible
climate refugia sites with high conservation value, where the long-term
probability of coral cover <= 0.1 was very low. Analytical results show that
this probability is most strongly influenced by among-site variability and by
interactions among benthic components within sites. These findings suggest that
conservation initiatives might be successful at the site scale as well as the
regional scale.

inter-trial intervals (ITIs) leads to more robust memory formation than does
massed training that involves short or no intervals. Several cognitive theories
have been proposed to explain this superiority, but only recently has data
begun to delineate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of spaced
training. We review these theories and data here. Computational models of the

optimal spaced training protocols, combined with pharmacotherapy, suggests
novel ways to rescue impaired synaptic plasticity and learning.

  transgenerational epigenetic inheritance"	"  A previous report claimed no evidence of transgenerational epigenetic
inheritance in a mouse model of in utero environmental exposure, based on the
observation that gene expression changes observed in the germ cells of G1 and
G2 male fetus were not in the same direction. A subsequent data reanalysis
however showed a statistically significant overlap between G1 and G2 genes
irrespective of direction, leading to the suggestion that, as phenotypic
variability in epigenetic transmission has been observed in several other
examples also, the above report provided evidence in favor of, not against,
transgenerational inheritance. This criticism has recently been questioned.
Here, it is shown that the questions raised are based not only on incorrect
statistical calculations but also on wrong premise that gene expression changes
do not constitute a phenotype.

and substrates, and form complex networks, e.g. metabolic pathways. Here we
developed a theory to predict the sensitivity, i.e. the responses of
concentrations and fluxes to perturbations of enzymes, from network structure
alone. Responses turn out to exhibit two characteristic patterns,
$localization$ and $hierarchy$. We present a general theorem connecting
sensitivity with network topology that explains these characteristic patterns.
Our results imply that network topology is an origin of biological robustness.
Finally, we suggest a strategy to determine real networks from experimental
measurements.

  Data"	"  Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer is currently the smallest sequencing device
available. While being able to produce very long reads (reads of up to 100~kbp
were reported), it is prone to high sequencing error rates of up to 30%. Since
most of these errors are insertions or deletions, it is very difficult to adapt
popular seed-based algorithms designed for aligning data sets with much lower
error rates.
  Base calling of MinION reads is typically done using hidden Markov models. In
this paper, we propose to represent each sequencing read by an ensemble of
sequences sampled from such a probabilistic model. This approach can improve
the sensitivity and false positive rate of seeding an alignment compared to
using a single representative base call sequence for each read.

on the diagnosis and commencement of treatment of individuals with active TB
infection. The stability of the disease free and endemic equilibriums is
investigated for any time delay. Corresponding optimal control problems, with
time delays in both state and control variables, are formulated and studied.
Although it is well-known that there is a delay between two to eight weeks
between TB infection and reaction of body's immune system to tuberculin, delays
for the active infected to be detected and treated, and delays on the treatment
of persistent latent individuals due to clinical and patient reasons, which
clearly justifies the introduction of time delays on state and control
measures, our work seems to be the first to consider such time-delays for TB
and apply time-delay optimal control to carry out the optimality analysis.

transition paths. We show that transition paths follow a predictable sequence
of high-free-energy transient states that are separated by free-energy
barriers. Each transient state corresponds to the assembly of one or more
discrete, cooperative units, which are determined directly from the native
structure. We show that the transition state on a folding pathway is reached
when a small number of critical contacts are formed between a specific set of
substructures, after which folding proceeds downhill in free energy. This
approach suggests a natural resolution for distinguishing parallel folding
pathways and provides a simple means to predict the rate-limiting step in a
folding reaction. Our theory identifies a common folding mechanism for proteins
with diverse native structures and establishes general principles for the
self-assembly of polymers with specific interactions.

  population rate"	"  Neurons within a population are strongly correlated, but how to simply
capture these correlations is still a matter of debate. Recent studies have
shown that the activity of each cell is influenced by the population rate,
defined as the summed activity of all neurons in the population. However, an
explicit, tractable model for these interactions is still lacking. Here we
build a probabilistic model of population activity that reproduces the firing
rate of each cell, the distribution of the population rate, and the linear
coupling between them. This model is tractable, meaning that its parameters can
be learned in a few seconds on a standard computer even for large population
recordings. We inferred our model for a population of 160 neurons in the
salamander retina. In this population, single-cell firing rates depended in
unexpected ways on the population rate. In particular, some cells had a
preferred population rate at which they were most likely to fire. These complex
dependencies could not be explained by a linear coupling between the cell and
the population rate. We designed a more general, still tractable model that
could fully account for these non-linear dependencies. We thus provide a simple
and computationally tractable way to learn models that reproduce the dependence
of each neuron on the population rate.

procedure but modulated by various types of proteins in general. Most of these
modulations are associated with the localization of related proteins in the
crowded lipid environment in bilayer membrane. This work presents an
mathematical model for the localization of multiple species of diffusion
molecules on membrane surfaces. We start with the energetic description of the
distributions of molecules on curved membrane surface, by assembling the
bending energy of bilayer membrane and the entropic energy of diffusive
molecules. We introduce the spontaneous curvature of molecules in membrane, and
define the spontaneous curvature of bilayer membrane as a function of the
molecule concentrations on membrane surfaces. This connection gives rise to a
drift-diffusion equation to govern the gradient flows of the surface molecule
concentrations. We recast the energetic formulation and the related governing
equations in the Eulerian framework by using a phase field function that
defines the membrane morphology. Computational simulations with the proposed
mathematical model and related numerical techniques predict the molecular
localization on membrane surfaces at locations with preferred mean curvature.

1606.08941	q-bio	q-bio.GN	"Enhancing power of rare variant association test by Zoom-Focus Algorithm
  (ZFA) to locate optimal testing region"	"  Motivation: Exome or targeted sequencing data exerts analytical challenge to
test single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with extremely small minor allele
frequency (MAF). Various rare variant tests were proposed to increase power by
aggregating SNPs within a fixed genomic region, such as a gene or pathway.
However, a gene could contain from several to thousands of markers, and not all
of them may be related to the phenotype. Combining functional and
non-functional SNPs in arbitrary genomic region could impair the testing power.
Results: We propose a Zoom-Focus algorithm (ZFA) to locate the optimal testing
region within a given genomic region, as a wrapper function to be applied in
conjunction with rare variant association tests. In the first Zooming step, a
given genomic region is partitioned by order of two, and the best partition is
located within all partition levels. In the next Focusing step, boundaries of
the zoomed region are refined. Simulation studies showed that ZFA substantially
enhanced the statistical power of rare variant tests by over 10 folds,
including the WSS, SKAT and W-test. The algorithm is applied on real exome
sequencing data of hypertensive disorder, and identified biologically relevant
genetic markers to metabolic disorder that are undiscoverable by testing using
full gene. The proposed algorithm is an efficient and powerful tool to increase
the effectiveness of rare variant association tests for exome sequencing
datasets of complex disorder.

  hypothesis in biological systems: A review"	"  Energy saving mechanisms are ubiquitous in nature. Aerodynamic and
hydrodynamic drafting, vortice uplift, Bernoulli suction, thermoregulatory
coupling, path following, physical hooks, synchronization, and cooperation are
only some of the better-known examples. While drafting mechanisms also appear
in non-biological systems such as sedimentation and particle vortices, the
broad spectrum of these mechanisms appears more diversely in biological systems
including bacteria, spermatozoa, various aquatic species, birds, land animals,
semi-fluid dwellers like turtle hatchlings, as well as human systems. We
present the thermodynamic framework for energy saving mechanisms, and we review
evidence in favor of the variation range hypothesis. This hypothesis posits
that, as an evolutionary process, the variation range between strongest and
weakest group members converges on the equivalent energy saving quantity that
is generated by the energy saving mechanism. We also review self-organized
structures that emerge due to energy saving mechanisms, including convective
processes that can be observed in many systems over both short and long time
scales, as well as high collective output processes in which a form of
collective position locking occurs.

Predictors of fixation locations are bottom-up factors like luminance contrast,
top-down factors like viewing instruction, and systematic biases like the
tendency to place fixations near the center of an image. However, comparatively
little is known about the dynamics of scanpaths after experimental manipulation
of specific fixation locations. Here we investigate the influence of initial
fixation position on subsequent eye-movement behavior on an image. We presented
64 colored photographs to participants who started their scanpaths from one of
two experimentally controlled positions in the right or left part of an image.
Additionally, we computed the images' saliency maps and classified them as
balanced images or images with high saliency values on either the left or right
side of a picture. As a result of the starting point manipulation, we found
long transients of mean fixation position and a tendency to overshoot to the
image side opposite to the starting position. Possible mechanisms for the
generation of this overshoot were investigated using numerical simulations of
statistical and dynamical models. We conclude that inhibitory tagging is a
viable mechanism for dynamical planning of scanpaths.

1606.09185	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Cognitive Control in the Controllable Connectome	"  Cognition is supported by neurophysiological processes that occur both in
local anatomical neighborhoods and in distributed large-scale circuits. Recent
evidence from network control theory suggests that white matter pathways
linking large-scale brain regions provide a critical substrate constraining the
ability of single areas to affect control on those processes. Yet, no direct
evidence exists for a relationship between brain network controllability and
cognitive control performance. Here, we address this gap by constructing
structural brain networks from diffusion tensor imaging data acquired in 125
healthy adult individuals. We define a simplified model of brain dynamics and
simulate network control to quantify modal and boundary controllability, which
together describe complementary features of a region's theoretically predicted
preference to drive the brain into different cognitive states. We observe that
individual differences in these control features derived from structural
connectivity are significantly correlated with individual differences in
cognitive control performance, as measured by a continuous performance
attention test, a color/shape switching task, the Stroop inhibition task, and a
spatial n-back working memory task. Indeed, control hubs like anterior
cingulate are distinguished from default mode and frontal association areas in
terms of the relationship between their control properties and individual
differences in cognitive function. These results provide the first empirical
evidence that network control forms a fundamental mechanism of cognitive
control.

  auditory midbrain"	"  How natural communication sounds are spatially represented across the
inferior colliculus, the main center of convergence for auditory information in
the midbrain, is not known. The neural representation of the acoustic stimuli
results from the interplay of locally differing input and the organization of
spectral and temporal neural preferences that change gradually across the
nucleus. This raises the question how similar the neural representation of the
communication sounds is across these gradients of neural preferences, and
whether it also changes gradually. Multi-unit cluster spike trains were
recorded from guinea pigs presented with a spectrotemporally rich set of eleven
species-specific communication sounds. Using cross-correlation, we analyzed the
response similarity of spiking activity across a broad frequency range for
similarly and differently frequency-tuned neurons. Furthermore, we separated
the contribution of the stimulus to the correlations to investigate whether
similarity is only attributable to the stimulus, or, whether interactions exist
between the multi-unit clusters that lead to correlations and whether these
follow the same representation as the response similarity. We found that
similarity of responses is dependent on the neurons' spatial distance for
similarly and differently frequency-tuned neurons, and that similarity
decreases gradually with spatial distance. Significant neural correlations
exist, and contribute to the response similarity. Our findings suggest that for
multi-unit clusters in the mammalian inferior colliculus, the gradual response
similarity with spatial distance to natural complex sounds is shaped by neural
interactions and the gradual organization of neural preferences.

families and ~70,000 species. Previous phylogenetic studies of the rosids have
primarily utilized organelle genes that likely differ in evolutionary histories
from nuclear genes. To better understand the evolutionary history of rosids, it
is necessary to investigate their phylogenetic relationships using nuclear
genes. Here, we employed large-scale phylogenomic datasets composed of nuclear
genes, including 891 clusters of putative orthologous genes. Combined with
comprehensive taxon sampling covering 63 species representing 14 out of the 17
orders, we reconstructed the rosids phylogeny with coalescence and
concatenation methods, yielding similar tree topologies from all datasets.
However, these topologies did not agree on the placement of Zygophyllales.
Through comprehensive analyses, we found that missing data and gene tree
heterogeneity were potential factors that may mislead concatenation methods, in
particular, large amounts of missing data under high gene tree heterogeneity.
Our results provided new insights into the deep phylogenetic relationships of
the rosids, and demonstrated that coalescence methods may effectively resolve
the phylogenetic relationships of the rosids with missing data under high gene
tree heterogeneity.

raw accelerometry data as they are typically summarized at the minute level. To
address this problem we define and estimate two gait measures of temporal
stride-to-stride variability based on raw accelerometry data: Amplitude

approach to on-body placement of the accelerometer by comparing hip, left and
right wrist placements. We illustrate the approach by estimating AD and PD in
46 elderly participants in the Developmental Epidemiologic Cohort Study (DECOS)

PD have a statistically significant association with the gait speed and
sit-to-stand test performance

full solution to this problem for an arbitrary K x K mutation rate matrix
involves solving for the stationary solution of a forward Kolmogorov equation
over a (K - 1)-dimensional simplex, and remains intractable. In most practical
situations mutations rates are slow on the scale of the diffusion limit and the
solution is heavily concentrated on the corners and edges of the simplex. In
this paper we present a practical approximate solution for slow mutation rates
in the form of a set of line densities along the edges of the simplex. The
method of solution relies on parameterising the general non-reversible rate
matrix as the sum of a reversible part and a set of (K - 1)(K - 2)/2
independent terms corresponding to fluxes of probability along closed paths
around faces of the simplex. The solution is potentially a first step in

various approaches for imaging cells in vivo have been proposed, most require
the use of labelling and also provide only qualitative imaging information.
Holographic imaging approach based on measuring the refractive index

quantitative and label-free imaging capability. Here, we demonstrate in vivo
two- and three-dimensional holographic imaging of circulating blood cells in
intact microcapillaries of live mice. The measured refractive index
distributions of blood cells provide morphological and biochemical properties
including three-dimensional cell shape, haemoglobin concentration, and
haemoglobin contents at the individual cell level. With the present method,

constraints to extend and complement Flux Balance Analysis. We introduce here
Constrained Allocation Flux Balance Analysis, CAFBA, in which the biosynthetic
costs associated to growth are accounted for in an effective way through a
single additional genome-wide constraint. Its roots lie in the experimentally
observed pattern of proteome allocation for metabolic functions, allowing to
bridge regulation and metabolism in a transparent way under the principle of
growth-rate maximization. We provide a simple method to solve CAFBA efficiently
and propose an ""ensemble averaging"" procedure to account for unknown protein
costs. Applying this approach to modeling E. coli metabolism, we find that, as
the growth rate increases, CAFBA solutions cross over from respiratory,
growth-yield maximizing states (preferred at slow growth) to fermentative
states with carbon overflow (preferred at fast growth). In addition, CAFBA
allows for quantitatively accurate predictions on the rate of acetate excretion
and growth yield based on only 3 parameters determined by empirical growth

  Classification Comparison of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF),
  Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and Sparse Coding Algorithms"	"  Brain networks in fMRI are typically identified using spatial independent
component analysis (ICA), yet mathematical constraints such as sparse coding
and positivity both provide alternate biologically-plausible frameworks for
generating brain networks. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) would
suppress negative BOLD signal by enforcing positivity. Spatial sparse coding
algorithms ($L1$ Regularized Learning and K-SVD) would impose local
specialization and a discouragement of multitasking, where the total observed
activity in a single voxel originates from a restricted number of possible
brain networks.
  The assumptions of independence, positivity, and sparsity to encode
task-related brain networks are compared; the resulting brain networks for
different constraints are used as basis functions to encode the observed
functional activity at a given time point. These encodings are decoded using
machine learning to compare both the algorithms and their assumptions, using
the time series weights to predict whether a subject is viewing a video,
listening to an audio cue, or at rest, in 304 fMRI scans from 51 subjects.
  For classifying cognitive activity, the sparse coding algorithm of $L1$
Regularized Learning consistently outperformed 4 variations of ICA across
different numbers of networks and noise levels (p$<$0.001). The NMF algorithms,
which suppressed negative BOLD signal, had the poorest accuracy. Within each
algorithm, encodings using sparser spatial networks (containing more
zero-valued voxels) had higher classification accuracy (p$<$0.001). The success
of sparse coding algorithms may suggest that algorithms which enforce sparse
coding, discourage multitasking, and promote local specialization may capture
better the underlying source processes than those which allow inexhaustible
local processes such as ICA.

treating the Alzheimer\{'}s disease (AD), is based on classification of
features extracted from brain images. The features have to accurately capture
main AD-related variations of anatomical brain structures, such as, e.g.,
ventricles size, hippocampus shape, cortical thickness, and brain volume. This
paper proposed to predict the AD with a deep 3D convolutional neural network
(3D-CNN), which can learn generic features capturing AD biomarkers and adapt to
different domain datasets. The 3D-CNN is built upon a 3D convolutional
autoencoder, which is pre-trained to capture anatomical shape variations in
structural brain MRI scans. Fully connected upper layers of the 3D-CNN are then
fine-tuned for each task-specific AD classification. Experiments on the
CADDementia MRI dataset with no skull-stripping preprocessing have shown our
3D-CNN outperforms several conventional classifiers by accuracy. Abilities of
the 3D-CNN to generalize the features learnt and adapt to other domains have

quasi-species becomes independent of mutational probabilities and the initial
frequency distributions of the sequences in high dimensional sequence spaces.
This result is the consequence of the concentration of measure on a high
dimensional hypersphere and its extension to Lipschitz functions knows as the
Levy's Lemma. Therefore, evolutionary dynamics almost always yields the same
value for fitness of the quasi-species, independent of the mutational process
and initial conditions, and is quite robust to mutational changes and
fluctuations in initial conditions. Our results naturally extend to any
Lipschitz function whose input parameters are the frequencies of individual
constituents of the quasi-species. This suggests that the functional
capabilities of high dimensional quasi-species are robust to fluctuations in
the mutational probabilities and initial conditions.

the human brain. This information processing is however dynamic and networks
can reconfigure at very short time period, few hundreds of millisecond. This
requires neuroimaging techniques with sufficient time resolution. Here we use
the dense electroencephalography, EEG, source connectivity methods to identify
cortical networks with excellent time resolution, in the order of millisecond.
We identify functional networks during picture naming task. Two categories of
visual stimuli were presented, meaningful (tools, animals) and meaningless
(scrambled) objects.
  In this paper, we report the reconfiguration of brain network modularity for
meaningful and meaningless objects. Results showed mainly that networks of
meaningful objects were more modular than those of meaningless objects.
Networks of the ventral visual pathway were activated in both cases. However a
strong occipitotemporal functional connectivity appeared for meaningful object
but not for meaningless object. We believe that this approach will give new
insights into the dynamic behavior of the brain networks during fast
information processing.

  Convolutional Network"	"  Early diagnosis, playing an important role in preventing progress and
treating the Alzheimer's disease (AD), is based on classification of features
extracted from brain images. The features have to accurately capture main
AD-related variations of anatomical brain structures, such as, e.g., ventricles
size, hippocampus shape, cortical thickness, and brain volume. This paper
proposes to predict the AD with a deep 3D convolutional neural network
(3D-CNN), which can learn generic features capturing AD biomarkers and adapt to
different domain datasets. The 3D-CNN is built upon a 3D convolutional
autoencoder, which is pre-trained to capture anatomical shape variations in
structural brain MRI scans. Fully connected upper layers of the 3D-CNN are then
fine-tuned for each task-specific AD classification. Experiments on the
\emph{ADNI} MRI dataset with no skull-stripping preprocessing have shown our
3D-CNN outperforms several conventional classifiers by accuracy and robustness.
Abilities of the 3D-CNN to generalize the features learnt and adapt to other
domains have been validated on the \emph{CADDementia} dataset.

the partially observed dynamics of anthracnose which is a phytopathology. The
signal here is the inhibition rate and the observations are the fruit volume
ant the rotted volume. We propose stochastic models based on the deterministic
models given in the references [21, 22], in order to represent the noise
introduced by uncontrolled variation on parameters and errors on the
measurements. Under the assumption of Brownian noises we prove the
well-posedness the models either they take into account the space variable or
not. The filtering problem is solved for the non-spatial model giving Zakai and
Kushner-Stratonovich equations satisfied respectively by the unnormalized and
the normalized conditional distribution of the signal with respect to the
observations. A prevision problem and a discrete filtering problem are also
studied for the realistic cases of discrete and possibly incomplete
observations. We illustrate the filter behaviour through numerical simulations
corresponding to different scenarios

length n that record the co-firing patterns of a set of neurons. Our focus is
on neural codes arising from place cells, neurons that respond to geographic
stimulus. In this setting, the stimulus space can be visualized as subset of
$\mathbb{R}^2$ covered by a collection $\mathcal{U}$ of convex sets such that
the arrangement $\mathcal{U}$ forms an Euler diagram for $\mathcal{C}$. There
are some methods to determine whether such a convex realization $\mathcal{U}$
exists; however, these methods do not describe how to draw a realization. In
this work, we look at the problem of algorithmically drawing Euler diagrams for
neural codes using two polynomial ideals: the neural ideal, a pseudo-monomial
ideal; and the neural toric ideal, a binomial ideal. In particular, we study
how these objects are related to the theory of piercings in information
visualization, and we show how minimal generating sets of the ideals reveal
whether or not a code is $0$, $1$, or $2$-inductively pierced.

1607.00868	q-bio	cs.CG math.MG math.OC q-bio.QM	"New error measures and methods for realizing protein graphs from
  distance data"	"  The interval Distance Geometry Problem (iDGP) consists in finding a
realization in $\mathbb{R}^K$ of a simple undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with
nonnegative intervals assigned to the edges in such a way that, for each edge,
the Euclidean distance between the realization of the adjacent vertices is
within the edge interval bounds. In this paper, we focus on the application to
the conformation of proteins in space, which is a basic step in determining
protein function: given interval estimations of some of the inter-atomic
distances, find their shape. Among different families of methods for
accomplishing this task, we look at mathematical programming based methods,
which are well suited for dealing with intervals. The basic question we want to
answer is: what is the best such method for the problem? The most meaningful
error measure for evaluating solution quality is the coordinate root mean
square deviation. We first introduce a new error measure which addresses a
particular feature of protein backbones, i.e. many partial reflections also
yield acceptable backbones. We then present a set of new and existing quadratic
and semidefinite programming formulations of this problem, and a set of new and
existing methods for solving these formulations. Finally, we perform a
computational evaluation of all the feasible solver$+$formulation combinations
according to new and existing error measures, finding that the best methodology
is a new heuristic method based on multiplicative weights updates.

a simple identification with default network activation toward a more
comprehensive view recognizing the role of the frontoparietal control network
and other areas. A major task ahead is to unravel the functional roles and
temporal dynamics of the widely distributed brain regions recruited during
self-generated thought. We argue that various other neuroscientific methods -
including lesion studies, human intracranial electrophysiology, and
manipulation of neurochemistry - have much to contribute to this project. These
diverse data have yet to be synthesized with the growing understanding of
self-generated thought gained from neuroimaging, however. Here, we highlight
several areas of ongoing inquiry and illustrate how evidence from other
methodologies corroborates, complements, and clarifies findings from functional
neuroimaging. Each methodology has particular strengths: functional
neuroimaging reveals much about the variety of brain areas and networks
reliably recruited. Lesion studies point to regions critical to generating and
consciously experiencing self-generated thought. Human intracranial
electrophysiology illuminates how and where in the brain thought is generated
and where this activity subsequently spreads. Finally, measurement and
manipulation of neurotransmitter and hormone levels can clarify what kind of
neurochemical milieu drives or facilitates self-generated cognition.
Integrating evidence from multiple complementary modalities will be a critical
step on the way to improving our understanding of the neurobiology of
functional and dysfunctional forms of self-generated thought.

AMR, with classification accuracies ranging from mid-90% to low- 80% depending

probability distributions. In order to model angular data, directional
probability distributions such as the bivariate von Mises (BVM) is typically
used. The critical task involved in mixture modelling is to determine the
optimal number of component probability distributions. We employ the Bayesian
information-theoretic principle of minimum message length (MML) to distinguish
mixture models by balancing the trade-off between the model's complexity and
its goodness-of-fit to the data. We consider the problem of modelling angular
data resulting from the spatial arrangement of protein structures using BVM
distributions. The main contributions of the paper include the development of
the mixture modelling apparatus along with the MML estimation of the parameters
of the BVM distribution. We demonstrate that statistical inference using the
MML framework supersedes the traditional methods and offers a mechanism to
objectively determine models that are of practical significance.

networks, from amino acid chains folding to proteins structures to rearranging
particle aggregates. How the network of interactions dynamically self-organizes
in such systems is far from fully understood. Here, we analyze a class of
spatial network formation processes by introducing a mapping from geometric to
graph-theoretic constraints. Combining stochastic and mean field analyses
yields an algebraic scaling law for the extent (graph diameter) of the
resulting networks with system size, in contrast to logarithmic scaling known
for networks without constraints. Intriguingly, the exponent falls between that
of self-avoiding random walks and that of space filling arrangements,
consistent with experimentally observed scaling (of the spatial radius of
gyration) for protein tertiary structures.

Statistical copolymers combining multiple phosphonic acid groups and
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) were synthesized and used as coating agents for 10
nm iron oxide nanocrystals. In vitro, protein corona and stability assays show
that phosphonic acid PEG copolymers outperform all other coating types
examined, including low molecular weight anionic ligands and polymers. In vivo,
the particle pharmacokinetics is investigated by monitoring the MRI signal
intensity from mouse liver, spleen and arteries as a function of the time,
between one minute and seven days after injection. Iron oxide particles coated
with multi-phosphonic acid PEG polymers are shown to have a blood circulation
lifetime of 250 minutes, i.e. 10 to 50 times greater than that of recently
published PEGylated probes and benchmarks. The clearance from the liver takes
in average 2 to 3 days and is independent of the core size, coating and

identify properties of the closed-loop neural control of posture and other
systems that are approximately linear time invariant. Here we extend this
approach to study the neural control of rhythmic behaviors such as walking. Our
method is based on the theory of linear time periodic systems, with
modifications to account for ability of perturbations to reset the phase of a
rhythmic behavior. We characterize responses to perturbations in the frequency
domain using harmonic transfer functions and then convert to the time domain to
obtain phase-dependent impulse response functions (IRFs) that describe the
response to a small brief perturbation at any phase of the rhythmic behavior.
IRFs describing responses of kinematic variables and muscle activations
(measured by EMG) to sensory and mechanical perturbations can be used to infer
properties of the plant, the mapping from muscle activation to movement, and of
neural feedback, the mapping from movement to muscle activation. We illustrate
our method by applying it to simulated data from a model and experimental data
of subjects walking on a treadmill perturbed by movement of the visual scene.

paradigm by demonstrating that complexity leads to instability in biological
systems. Here Mays random-matrix modelling approach is generalized to realistic
large-scale webs of species interactions, be they structured by networks of
competition, mutualism or both. Simple relationships are found to govern these
otherwise intractable models, and control the parameter ranges for which
biological systems are stable and feasible. Our analysis of model and real
empirical networks is only achievable upon introducing a simplifying
Google-matrix reduction scheme, which in the process, yields a practical
ecological eigenvalue stability index. These results provide an understanding
on how network topology, especially connectance, influences species stable
coexistence. Constraints controlling feasibility (positive equilibrium
populations) in these systems, are found more restrictive than those
controlling stability, helping explain the enigma of why many classes of
feasible ecological models are nearly always stable.

  Network Structure"	"  A critical mystery in neuroscience lies in determining how anatomical
structure impacts the complex functional dynamics of human thought. How does
large-scale brain circuitry constrain states of neuronal activity and
transitions between those states? We address these questions using a maximum
entropy model of brain dynamics informed by white matter tractography. We
demonstrate that the most probable brain states -- characterized by minimal
energy -- display common activation profiles across brain areas: local
spatially-contiguous sets of brain regions reminiscent of cognitive systems are
co-activated frequently. The predicted activation rate of these systems is
highly correlated with the observed activation rate measured in a separate
resting state fMRI data set, validating the utility of the maximum entropy
model in describing neurophysiologial dynamics. This approach also offers a
formal notion of the energy of activity within a system, and the energy of
activity shared between systems. We observe that within- and between-system
energies cleanly separate cognitive systems into distinct categories, optimized
for differential contributions to integrated v.s. segregated function. These
results support the notion that energetic and structural constraints
circumscribe brain dynamics, offering novel insights into the roles that
cognitive systems play in driving whole-brain activation patterns.

control gene regulation. Computational methods that predict gene expression
from histone modification signals are highly desirable for understanding their
combinatorial effects in gene regulation. This knowledge can help in developing
'epigenetic drugs' for diseases like cancer. Previous studies for quantifying
the relationship between histone modifications and gene expression levels
either failed to capture combinatorial effects or relied on multiple methods
that separate predictions and combinatorial analysis. This paper develops a
unified discriminative framework using a deep convolutional neural network to
classify gene expression using histone modification data as input. Our system,
called DeepChrome, allows automatic extraction of complex interactions among
important features. To simultaneously visualize the combinatorial interactions
among histone modifications, we propose a novel optimization-based technique
that generates feature pattern maps from the learnt deep model. This provides
an intuitive description of underlying epigenetic mechanisms that regulate
genes. Results: We show that DeepChrome outperforms state-of-the-art models
like Support Vector Machines and Random Forests for gene expression
classification task on 56 different cell-types from REMC database. The output
of our visualization technique not only validates the previous observations but
also allows novel insights about combinatorial interactions among histone

be mutually exclusive across tumors, providing a signal for distinguishing
driver mutations from a larger number of random passenger mutations. This
mutual exclusivity signal can be confounded by high and highly variable
mutation rates across a cohort of samples. Current statistical tests for
exclusivity that incorporate both per-gene and per-sample mutational
frequencies are computationally expensive and have limited precision.
  We formulate a weighted exact test for assessing the significance of
mutational exclusivity in an arbitrary number of mutational events. Our test
conditions on the number of samples with a mutation as well as per-event,
per-sample mutation probabilities. We provide a recursive formula to compute
$p$-values for the weighted test exactly as well as a highly accurate and
efficient saddlepoint approximation of the test. We use our test to approximate
a commonly used permutation test for exclusivity that conditions on per-event,
per-sample mutation frequencies. However, our test is more efficient and it
recovers more significant results than the permutation test. We use our
Weighted Exclusivity Test (WExT) software to analyze hundreds of colorectal and
endometrial samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, which are two cancer types
that often have extremely high mutation rates. On both cancer types, the
weighted test identifies sets of mutually exclusive mutations in cancer genes
with fewer false positives than earlier approaches.

passage time for a viral particle to attain alive the nucleus. The cell nucleus
is covered with thousands of small absorbing nuclear pores and the minimum
distance between them defines the smallest spatial scale that limits the
efficiency of stochastic simulations. Using the Neuman-Green's function method
to solve the steady-state Fokker-Planck equation, we derive asymptotic formula

about biology and disease as has sequence alignment. Sequence alignment can be
optimally solved in polynomial time. In contrast, network alignment is
$NP$-hard, meaning optimal solutions are impossible to find, and the quality of
found alignments depend strongly upon the algorithm used to create them. Every
network alignment algorithm consists of two orthogonal components: first, an
objective function or measure $M$ that is used to evaluate the quality of any
proposed alignment, and second, a search algorithm used to explore the
exponentially large set of possible alignments in an effort to find ""good"" ones
according to $M$. Objective functions fall into many categories, including
biological measures such as sequence similarity, as well as topological
measures like graphlet similarity and edge coverage (possibly weighted).
Algorithms to search the space of all possible alignments can be deterministic
or stochastic, and many possibilities have been offered over the past decade.
In this paper we introduce a new stochastic search algorithm called SANA:
Simulated Annealing Network Aligner. We test it on several popular objective
functions and demonstrate that it almost universally optimizes each one
significantly better than existing search algorithms. Finally, we compare
several topological objective functions using SANA. Software available at

in the fitness of all microorganisms, and its dependence on size may reveal
clues to the origins of evolutionary transitions to multicellularity. Because
potential benefits in uptake rates must be viewed in the context of other costs
and benefits of size, such as varying predation rates and the increased
metabolic costs associated with larger and more complex body plans, the uptake
rate itself is not necessarily that which is optimized by evolution. Uptake
rates can be strongly dependent on local organism geometry and its swimming
speed, providing selective pressure for particular arrangements. Here we
examine these issues for choanoflagellates, filter-feeding microorganisms that
are the closest relatives of the animals. We explore the different
morphological variations of the choanoflagellete $Salpingoeca~rosetta$, which
can exist as a swimming cell, a sessile thecate cell, and as colonies of cells
in various shapes. In the absence of other requirements and in a homogeneously
nutritious environment, we find that the optimal strategy to maximize filter
feeding by the collar of microvilli is to swim fast, which favours swimming
unicells. In large external flows, the sessile thecate cell becomes
advantageous. Effects of prey diffusion are discussed and also found to be to
the advantage of the swimming unicell.

seems pertinent to explore whether the brain might use other physical
modalities than the ones that have been discovered so far. In particular it is
well established that neurons can emit photons, which prompts the question
whether these biophotons could serve as signals between neurons, in addition to
the well-known electro-chemical signals. For such communication to be targeted,
the photons would need to travel in waveguides. Here we show, based on detailed
theoretical modeling, that myelinated axons could serve as photonic waveguides,
taking into account realistic optical imperfections. We propose experiments,
both \textit{in vivo} and \textit{in vitro}, to test our hypothesis. We discuss
the implications of our results, including the question whether photons could
mediate long-range quantum entanglement in the brain.

  Inhibition by Ultraviolet and Photosynthetically Available Radiation: Global
  Predictions for $\textit{Prochlorococcus}$ and $\textit{Synechococcus}$"	"  Phytoplankton photosynthesis in most natural waters is often inhibited by
ultraviolet (UV) and intense photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) but
the effects on ocean productivity have received little consideration aside from
polar areas subject to periodic enhanced UV-B due to depletion of stratospheric
ozone. Here we consider responses in the temperate and tropical mid-ocean
regions typically dominated by picophytoplankton including the prokaryotic
lineages, $\textit{Prochlorococcus}$ and $\textit{Synechococcus}$. Spectral
models of photosynthetic response for each lineage were constructed using model
strains cultured at different growth irradiances and temperatures. In the
model, inhibition becomes more severe once exposure exceeds a threshold (Emax)
related to repair capacity. Model parameters are presented for
$\textit{Prochlorococcus}$ adding to those previously presented for
$\textit{Synechococcus}$. The models were applied to the estimation of mid-day,
water-column photosynthesis based on an atmospheric model of spectral incident
radiation, satellite-derived spectral water transparency and sea surface
temperature. Comparing predictions integrated over the water column including
versus excluding inhibition, production was 7-28% lower due to inhibition
depending on strain and site conditions. Inhibition was consistently greater
for $\textit{Prochlorococcus}$ compared to two strains of
$\textit{Synechococcus}$. Considering only the surface mixed layer, production
was inhibited 7-73%. Weighted by lineage abundance and daily PAR exposure,
inhibition of full water column production averages around 20% for the modeled
region of the Pacific with two-thirds of the inhibition due to UV. The results
suggest more consideration is needed on inhibition effects, especially due to
UV, which are largely excluded from present models of global phytoplankton
production.

  Model"	"  The HP model of protein folding, where the chain exists in a free medium, is
investigated using a parallel Monte Carlo scheme based upon Wang-Landau
sampling. Expanding on the work of Wust and Landau by introducing a lesser
known replica -exchange scheme between individual Wang- Landau samplers, the
problem of dynamical trapping (spiking in the density of states) was avoided
and an enhancement in the efficiency of traversing configuration space was
obtained. Highlighting dynamical trapping as an issue for lattice polymer
simulations for increasing lengths is explicitly done here for the first time.
The 1/t scheme is also integrated within this sophisticated Monte Carlo
methodology. A trial move set was developed which includes pull, bond
re-bridging, pivot, kink-flip and a newly invented and implemented fragment
random walk move which allowed rapid exploration of high and low temperature
configurations. A native state search was conducted leading to the attainment
of the native states of the benchmark sequences of 2D50 (-21), 2D60 (-36)and
2D64 (-42), whilst attaining minimum energies close to the native state for
2D85(-52 NATIVE= -53), 2D100a (-47 NATIVE= -48) and 2D100b (-49 NATIVE=-50).
Thermodynamic observables such as the specific heat, internal energy, entropy
and free energy were computed for 2D benchmark sequences at varying
temperatures and folding and unfolding behaviour was investigated. Lattice
polymers with monomeric hydrophobic structure were also studied in the same
manner with the recording of minimum energy values and thermodynamic behaviour.
The native results for the benchmark sequences and lattice polymers were
compared with varying computational methods.

must be updated or replaced due to changes in objectives and constraints. It is
often claimed that evolutionary algorithms are particularly suitable for
dynamic optimisation because a large population can contain different solutions
that may be useful in the future. However, rigorous theoretical demonstrations
for how populations in dynamic optimisation can be essential are sparse and
restricted to special cases.
  This paper provides theoretical explanations of how populations can be
essential in evolutionary dynamic optimisation in a general and natural
setting. We describe a natural class of dynamic optimisation problems where a
sufficiently large population is necessary to keep track of moving optima
reliably. We establish a relationship between the population-size and the
probability that the algorithm loses track of the optimum.

World Wide Web is a common task in our daily lives. Estimation of a user's
interest or search intention is necessary to recommend and retrieve relevant
information from these collections. We introduce a brain-information interface
used for recommending information by relevance inferred directly from brain
signals. In experiments, participants were asked to read Wikipedia documents
about a selection of topics while their EEG was recorded. Based on the
prediction of word relevance, the individual's search intent was modeled and
successfully used for retrieving new, relevant documents from the whole English
Wikipedia corpus. The results show that the users' interests towards digital
content can be modeled from the brain signals evoked by reading. The introduced
brain-relevance paradigm enables the recommendation of information without any
explicit user interaction, and may be applied across diverse
information-intensive applications.

1607.03687	q-bio	q-bio.NC stat.AP	Critical comments on EEG sensor space dynamical connectivity analysis	"  Many different analysis techniques have been developed and applied to EEG
recordings that allow one to investigate how different brain areas interact.
One particular class of methods, based on the linear parametric representation
of multiple interacting time series, is widely used to study causal
connectivity in the brain. However, the results obtained by these methods
should be interpreted with great care. The goal of this paper is to show, both
theoretically and using simulations, that results obtained by applying causal
connectivity measures on the sensor (scalp) time series do not allow
interpretation in terms of interacting brain sources. This is because 1) the
channel locations cannot be seen as an approximation of a source's anatomical
location and 2) spurious connectivity can occur between sensors. Although many
measures of causal connectivity derived from EEG sensor time series are
affected by the latter, here we will focus on the well-known time domain index
of Granger causality (GC) and on the frequency domain directed transfer
function (DTF). Using the state-space framework and designing two simulation
studies we show that mixing effects caused by volume conduction can lead to
spurious connections, detected either by time domain GC or by DTF. Therefore,
GC/DTF causal connectivity measures should be computed at the source level, or
derived within analysis frameworks that model the effects of volume conduction.
Since mixing effects can also occur in the source space, it is advised to
combine source space analysis with connectivity measures that are robust to
mixing.

  the evaluation of the epidemic risk"	"  The ability to directly record human face-to-face interactions increasingly
enables the development of detailed data-driven models for the spread of
directly transmitted infectious diseases at the scale of individuals. Complete
coverage of the contacts occurring in a population is however generally
unattainable, due for instance to limited participation rates or experimental
constraints in spatial coverage. Here, we study the impact of spatially
constrained sampling on our ability to estimate the epidemic risk in a
population using such detailed data-driven models. The epidemic risk is
quantified by the epidemic threshold of the
susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible model for the propagation of
communicable diseases, i.e. the critical value of disease transmissibility
above which the disease turns endemic. We verify for both synthetic and
empirical data of human interactions that the use of incomplete data sets due
to spatial sampling leads to the underestimation of the epidemic risk. The bias
is however smaller than the one obtained by uniformly sampling the same
fraction of contacts: it depends nonlinearly on the fraction of contacts that
are recorded and becomes negligible if this fraction is large enough. Moreover,
it depends on the interplay between the timescales of population and spreading
dynamics.

conformation. The native states of a protein can be regard as an ensemble of a
lot of similar conformations, in different conformations the main chain
dihedral angles vary in a certain range. Each dihedral angle value can be
described as a distribution, but only using the distribution can't describe the
real conformation space. The reason is that the dihedral angle has correlation
with others, especially the neighbor dihedral angles in primary sequence. In
our study we analysis extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories
of eleven proteins with different sizes and folds, we found that in stable
second structure the correlations only exist between the dihedrals near to each
other in primary sequence, long range correlations are rare. But in unstable
structures (loop) long range correlations exist. Further we observed some
characteristics of the short range correlations in different second structures
({\alpha}-helix, {\beta}-sheet) and we found that we can approximate good high
order dihedral angle distribution good only use three order distribution in
stable second structure which illustrates that high order correlations (over
three order) is small in stable second structure.

and monitoring of genetic diversity that genetic information at a genome level
be obtained. Here we report the draft assembly of the southern bluefin tuna
genome and the collection of genome-wide sequence data for five other tuna
species. We sampled five tuna species of the genus Thunnus, the northern and
southern bluefin, yellowfin, albacore, and bigeye, as well as the skipjack
(Katsuwonis pelamis), a tuna-like species. Genome assembly was facilitated at
k-mer=25 while k-mer=51 generated assembly artefacts. The estimated size of the
southern bluefin tuna genome was 795 Mb. We assembled two southern bluefin tuna
individuals independently using both paired end and mate pair sequence. This
resulted in scaffolds with N50>174,000 bp and maximum scaffold lengths>1.4 Mb.
Our estimate of the size of the assembled genome was the scaffolded sequences
in common to both assemblies, which amounted to 721 Mb of the 795 Mb of the
southern bluefin tuna genome sequence. Using BLAST, there were matches between
13,039 of 14,341 (91%) refseq mRNA of the zebrafish Danio rerio to the tuna
assembly indicating that most of a generic fish transcriptome was covered by
the assembly.

1607.04146	q-bio	cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.bio-ph q-bio.BM	Molecular Mechanics of Chitin-Protein Interface	"  Chitin and protein are two main building blocks for many natural
biomaterials. The interaction between chitin and protein critically determines
the properties of the composite biological materials. As living organisms
usually encounter complex ambient conditions like water, pH and ions are
critical factors towards the structural integrity of biomaterials. It is
therefore essential to study the chitin-protein interface under different
environmental conditions. Here, an atomistic model consisting of a chitin
substrate and a protein filament is constructed, which is regarded as a
representative of the chitin-protein interface existing in many chitin-based
biomaterials. Based on this model, the mechanical properties of chitin-protein
interface under different moisture and pH values are investigated through
molecular dynamics simulations. The results reveal a weakening effect of water
towards the chitin-protein interface, as well as acidity, i.e. the protonated
protein forms a stronger adhesion to chitin than that in the alkaline
environment. In addition, the effect from side-chain of protein is studied and
it is found that certain kinds of amino acid can form hydrophobic connections
to chitin surface, which means that these peptides partly dodge the weakening
effect of water. Our observation indicates that terminuses and side-chains in
protein are of importance in forming interfacial hydrogen bonds. From our full
atomistic models, we can observe some molecular mechanisms about how protein
interacts with chitin in different conditions, which may spotlight the
engineering on biomaterials with similar interfaces.

structural models, and uses them to estimate its probability density
distribution for quality assessment. Qprob has been blindly tested on the 11th

MULTICOM-NOVEL server. The official CASP result shows that Qprob ranks as one
of the top single-model QA methods. In addition, Qprob makes contributions to
our protein tertiary structure predictor MULTICOM, which is officially ranked
3rd out of 143 predictors. The good performance shows that Qprob is good at
assessing the quality of models of hard targets. These results demonstrate that
this new probability density distribution based method is effective for protein
single-model quality assessment and is useful for protein structure prediction.

with one another and with other regions of the brain to support the dynamic
acquisition of value-related knowledge. Here, we use a network neuroscience
approach to examine how BOLD functional networks change as 20 healthy human
subjects learn the values of novel visual stimuli over the course of four
consecutive days. We show that connections between regions of the visual,
frontal, and cingulate cortices become increasingly stronger as learning
progresses, and that these changes are primarily confined to the temporal core
of the network. These results demonstrate that functional networks dynamically
track behavioral improvement in value judgments, and that interactions between
network communities form predictive biomarkers of learning.

method for generating proper parameters of the force field form is the key
component for computational research in chemistry, biochemistry, and
condensed-phase physics. Our study showed that the feasibility to predict
experimental condensed phase properties (i.e., density and heat of
vaporization) of methanol through problem specific force field from only
quantum chemistry information. To acquire the satisfying parameter sets of the
force field, the genetic algorithm (GA) is the main optimization method. For
electrostatic potential energy, we optimized both the electrostatic parameters
of methanol using the GA method, which leads to low deviations of between the
quantum mechanics (QM) calculations and the GA optimized parameters. We
optimized the van der Waals (vdW) parameters both using GA and guided GA
methods by calibrating interaction energy of various methanol homo-clusters,
such as nonamers, undecamers, or tridecamers. Excellent agreement between the
training dataset from QM calculations (i.e., MP2) and GA optimized parameters
can be achieved. However, only the guided GA method, which eliminates the
overestimation of interaction energy from MP2 calculations in the optimization
process, provides proper vdW parameters for MD simulation to get the condensed
phase properties (i.e., density and heat of vaporization) of methanol.
Throughout the whole optimization process, the experimental value were not
involved in the objective functions, but were only used for the purpose of
justifying models (i.e., nonamers, undecamers, or tridecamers) and validating
methods (i.e., GA or guided GA). Our method shows the possibility of developing
descriptive polarizable force field using only QM calculations.

predicts not only solvation free energies accurately but also solvation
entropies, which standard continuum electrostatic models fail to predict. The
HSBC/MSA model depends only on the normal electric field at the dielectric

applications ranging from microbial populations to human societies. Research
has shown, however, that mobility jeopardizes biodiversity by promoting the
formation of spiral waves, especially if there is no conservation law in place
for the total number of competing players. Firstly, we show that even if such a
conservation law applies, mobility still jeopardizes biodiversity in the
spatial rock-paper-scissors game if only a small fraction of links of the
square lattice is randomly rewired. Secondly, we show that zealots are very
effective in taming the amplitude of oscillations that emerge due to mobility
and/or interaction randomness, and this regardless of whether the later is
quenched or annealed. While even a tiny fraction of zealots brings significant
benefits, at 5\% occupancy zealots practically destroy all oscillations
regardless of the intensity of mobility, and regardless of the type and
strength of randomness in the interaction structure. Interestingly, by annealed
randomness the impact of zealots is qualitatively the same as by mobility,
which highlights that fast diffusion does not necessarily destroy the
coexistence of species, and that zealotry thus helps to recover the stable
mean-field solution. Our results strengthen the important role of zealots in
models of cyclic dominance, and they reveal fascinating evolutionary outcomes
in structured populations that are a unique consequence of such uncompromising
behavior.

a high dimensional ambient space. Random projections are a simple, powerful
tool for dimensionality reduction of such data. Previous works have studied
bounds on how many projections are needed to accurately preserve the geometry
of these manifolds, given their intrinsic dimensionality, volume and curvature.
However, such works employ definitions of volume and curvature that are
inherently difficult to compute. Therefore such theory cannot be easily tested
against numerical simulations to understand the tightness of the proven bounds.
We instead study typical distortions arising in random projections of an
ensemble of smooth Gaussian random manifolds. We find explicitly computable,
approximate theoretical bounds on the number of projections required to
accurately preserve the geometry of these manifolds. Our bounds, while
approximate, can only be violated with a probability that is exponentially
small in the ambient dimension, and therefore they hold with high probability
in cases of practical interest. Moreover, unlike previous work, we test our
theoretical bounds against numerical experiments on the actual geometric
distortions that typically occur for random projections of random smooth
manifolds. We find our bounds are tighter than previous results by several
orders of magnitude.

a 5% reduction in velocity during the translocation. We also find a striking
correlation in velocity fluctuations with a decay constant of 100s of {\mu}s.
These results shed light on hitherto unresolved problems in the dynamics of DNA
translocation and provide guidance for experiments seeking to determine
positional information along a DNA strand.

  integrate-and-fire"	"  We have studied neuronal synchronisation in a random network of adaptive
exponential integrate-and-fire neurons. We study how spiking or bursting
synchronous behaviour appears as a function of the coupling strength and the
probability of connections, by constructing parameter spaces that identify
these synchronous behaviours from measurements of the inter-spike interval and
the calculation of the order parameter. Moreover, we verify the robustness of
synchronisaton by applying an external perturbation to each neuron. The
simulations show that bursting synchronisation is more robust than spike
synchronisation.

  of three competing clones"	"  In large adapting clonal species, several beneficial mutations can co-occur,
affecting the process of adaptation. Several experimental and theoretical works
showed that clonal interference can be an important factor limiting the rate of
adaptation. However, models done so far do not embrace the diversity of
observed dynamics in experiments, especially non-linear dynamics. We develop
here a stochastic model with explicit competitive interactions between clones
and describe the complexity of the emerging dynamics of the population,
supposing that two mutants enter a resident population in a single copy at
different times. These clones can either get fixed, be lost or be maintained in
polymorphism, depending on their competitive abilities. We show that
frequency-dependent selection can give rise to unexpected dynamics: competitive
interactions between clones can foster adaptation by increasing or decreasing
both the fixation probability and time of beneficial mutations. We finally
estimate the likeliness of frequency-dependent selection and of the different
potential final states of the population by assuming prior distributions of the
ecological parameters. We show that under our assumptions, non-transitive
fitness and non-linear dynamics are likely to play an important role into the
adaptation of large clonal populations

ecology, but the effect of this process on properties of community interaction
networks is still largely unknown. Here, we use a systematic analytical
framework to describe how assembly from a species pool gives rise to community
network properties that differ from those of the pool: Compared to the pool,
the community shows a bias towards higher carrying capacities, weaker
competitive interactions and stronger beneficial interactions. Moreover, even
if interactions between all pool species are completely random, community
networks are more structured, with correlations between interspecies
interactions, and between interactions and carrying capacities. Nonetheless, we
show that these properties are not sufficient to explain the coexistence of all
community species, and that it is a simple relation between interactions and
species abundances that is responsible for the diversity within a community.

  Scale Free Networks"	"  In the present work the spread of epidemic is studied over complex networks
which are characterized by power law degree distribution of links and
heterogeneous rate of disease transmission. The random allocation of epidemic
transmission rates to the nodes results in the heterogeneity, which in turn
causes the segregation of nodes in terms of various sub populations. The aim of
the study is to gain microscopic insight into the effect of interactions among
various sub populations in the spreading processes of disease over such
networks. The discrete time Markov chain method based upon the susceptible
infected susceptible (SIS) model of diseases transmission has been used to
describe the spreading of epidemic over the networks. The study is
parameterized in terms of variable $\lambda$, defined as the number of contacts
a node makes with the fraction of its neighboring nodes. From the simulation
results, it is found that the spread of epidemic on such networks is critical
in terms of number of minimum contacts made by a node below which there is no
outbreak of disease. The degree of infection in these networks is assessed from
the size of epidemic defined in terms of fraction of infected nodes of the
total number and their corresponding level of infection. The results of the
parametric study demonstrates the dependence of the epidemic size upon number
of concurrent contacts made by a node ($\lambda$ ) and the average number of
links per node. In both these cases, the size of the epidemic is found to
increase with the corresponding increase in respective parameters.

  occupancy models"	"  When evaluating the ecological value of land use within a landscape,
investigators typically rely on measures of habitat selection and habitat
quality. Traditional measures of habitat selection and habitat quality require
data from resource intensive study designs (e.g., telemetry or mark-recapture).
Often, managers must evaluate ecological value despite only having data from
less resource intensive study designs. In this paper, we use occupancy data to
measure habitat quality and habitat selection response for the Puerto Rican
Vireo, an endemic songbird whose population growth is depressed by brood
parasitism from the Shiny Cowbird. We were interested in how vireo habitat
quality and vireo habitat selection varied among three land uses (forest,
shaded coffee plantations, and sun coffee) in Puerto Rico. We estimated vireo
occupancy probability as a measure of habitat selection, and the probability of
cowbird occurrence given vireo presence as a measure of habitat quality. To
estimate the latter, we explored different ways of modeling the occurrence of
the two species jointly, and compared these models to independent models using
measures of predictive performance. Vireos preferentially selected forested
sites and shaded coffee sites over sun coffee sites. By our measure of habitat
quality, either type of coffee plantation was poor quality, and the forested
sites were high quality. This suggests that shade coffee may be an ecological
trap for the vireo in our study area. One joint model performed best by our
measures of predictive ability, thus showing that the cowbird may not occur
independently of the vireo. Vireo population dynamics in our study area may
benefit from having large amounts of forest relative to coffee plantations.
Incorporating species interactions into occupancy models has the potential to
improve monitoring for conservation.

at a reaction site is a common feature in cell biology. Using a lattice gas
model we study the impact of diffusion and capture for a microtubule polymerase
and a depolymerase. Our results show that the capture mechanism localizes the
proteins and creates large-scale spatial correlations. We develop an analytic
approximation that globally accounts for relevant correlations and yields
results that are in excellent agreement with experimental data. Our results
show that diffusion and capture operates most efficiently at cellular enzyme
concentrations which points to in vivo relevance.

  Outcomes"	"  The goal of this article is to investigate how human participants allocate
their limited time to decisions with different properties. We report the
results of two behavioral experiments. In each trial of the experiments, the
participant must accumulate noisy information to make a decision. The
participants received positive and negative rewards for their correct and
incorrect decisions, respectively. The stimulus was designed such that
decisions based on more accumulated information were more accurate but took
longer. Therefore, the total outcome that a participant could achieve during
the limited experiments' time depended on her ""decision threshold"", the amount
of information she needed to make a decision. In the first experiment, two
types of trials were intermixed randomly: hard and easy. Crucially, the hard
trials were associated with smaller positive and negative rewards than the easy
trials. A cue presented at the beginning of each trial would indicate the type
of the upcoming trial. The optimal strategy was to adopt a small decision
threshold for hard trials. The results showed that several of the participants
did not learn this simple strategy. We then investigated how the participants
adjusted their decision threshold based on the feedback they received in each
trial. To this end, we developed and compared 10 computational models for
adjusting the decision threshold. The models differ in their assumptions on the
shape of the decision thresholds and the way the feedback is used to adjust the
decision thresholds. The results of Bayesian model comparison showed that a
model with time-varying thresholds whose parameters are updated by a
reinforcement learning algorithm is the most likely model.

  Processes"	"  The dynamic interplay between collective cell movement and the various
molecules involved in the accompanying cell signalling mechanisms plays a
crucial role in many biological processes including normal tissue development
and pathological scenarios such as wound healing and cancer. Information about
the various structures embedded within these processes allows a detailed
exploration of the binding of molecular species to cell-surface receptors
within the evolving cell population. In this paper we establish a general
spatio-temporal-structural framework that enables the description of molecular
binding to cell membranes coupled with the cell population dynamics. We first
provide a general theoretical description for this approach and then illustrate
it with two examples arising from cancer invasion.

systems. The pancreatic {\alpha} and {\beta} cells produce glucagon and insulin
for glucose homeostasis. They exist in multiple micro-organs, the islets of
Langerhans, not in a single gigantic organ, in which the two reciprocal cells
interact to each other, and also with an additional cell type, {\delta} cell.
We found that the positive/negative interactions between the islet cells are
designed not only to reduce the wasteful zero-sum action of glucagon and
insulin, but also to enhance/suppress synchronization of hormone secretions
between islets under high/normal glucose conditions. Thus we suggest that the
anti-symmetric interaction between three cell populations can organize an
effective network motif for controlling network synchronization.

  chain?"	"  General laws in ecological parasitology are scarce. Here we evaluate data
published by over 100 authors to determine whether the number of hosts in a
life cycle is associated with the degree of aggregation of fish parasites at
different stages. Parasite species were grouped taxonomically to produce 20 or
more data points per group as far as possible. Most parasites that remained at
one trophic level were less aggregated than those that had passed up a food
chain. We use a stochastic model to show that high parasite overdispersion in
predators can be solely the result of the accumulation of parasites in their
prey. The model is further developed to show that a change in the predators
feeding behaviour with age may further increase parasite aggregation.

1607.05530	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Verbal Perception and the Word Length Effect	"  A theoretical framework is proposed for the understanding of verbal
perception -- the conversion of words into meaning, modeled as a compromise
between lexical demands and contextual constraints -- and the theory is tested
against experiments on short-term memory. The observation that lists of short
words are recalled better than lists of long ones has been a long-standing
subject of controversy, further complicated by the apparent inversion of the
effect for mixed lists. In the framework here proposed, these behaviors emerge
as an effect of the different level of localization of short and long words in
semantic space. Events corresponding to the recognition of a nonlocal word have
a clustering property in phase space, which facilitates associative retrieval.
The standard word-length effect arises directly from this property, and the
inverse effect from its breakdown. An analysis of data from the PEERS
experiments (Healey and Kahana, 2016) confirms the main predictions of the
theory. Further predictions are listed and new experiments are proposed.
Finally, an interpretation of the above results is presented.

their locations represent an important, yet poorly understood, mechanism of
genetic regulation. Quantifying the strength of interactions within the
nucleosome is a central problem in biophysics and is critical to understanding
how nucleosome positions influence gene expression. By comparing to
single-molecule experiments, we demonstrate that a coarse-grained molecular
model of the nucleosome can reproduce key aspects of nucleosome unwrapping.
Using detailed simulations of DNA and histone proteins, we calculate the
tension-dependent free energy surface corresponding to the unwrapping process.
The model reproduces quantitatively the forces required to unwrap the
nucleosome, and reveals the role played by electrostatic interactions during
this process. We then demonstrate that histone modifications and DNA sequence
can have significant effects on the energies of nucleosome formation. Most
notably, we show that histone tails are crucial for stabilizing the outer turn
of nucleosomal DNA.

  skeletal muscle modeling between high power output and slow rise in tension"	"  Almost 60 years ago Andrew Huxley with his seminal paper \cite{Huxley1957}
laid the foundation of modern muscle modeling, linking chemical events to
mechanical performance. He described mechanics and energetics of muscle
contraction through the cyclical attachment and detachment of myosin motors to
the actin filament with ad hoc assumptions on the dependence of the rate
constants on the strain of the myosin motors. That relatively simple hypothesis
is still present in recent models, even though with several modifications to
adapt the model to the different experimental constraints which became
subsequently available. However, already in that paper, one controversial
aspect of the model became clear. Relatively high attachment and detachment
rates of myosin to the actin filament were needed to simulate the high power
output at intermediate velocity of contraction. However, these rates were
incompatible with the relatively slow rise in tension after activation, despite
the rise should be generated by the same rate functions. This discrepancy has
not been fully solved till today, despite several hypotheses have been
forwarded to reconcile the two aspects. Here, using a conventional muscle
model, we show that the recently revealed mechanosensing mechanism of
recruitment of myosin motors \cite{Linarietal2015} can solve this long standing
problem without any further ad-hoc hypotheses.

  prediction of solvation free energies"	"  In this work, a systematic protocol is proposed to automatically parametrize
implicit solvent models with polar and nonpolar components. The proposed
protocol utilizes the classical Poisson model or the Kohn-Sham density
functional theory (KSDFT) based polarizable Poisson model for modeling polar
solvation free energies. For the nonpolar component, either the standard model
of surface area, molecular volume, and van der Waals interactions, or a model
with atomic surface areas and molecular volume is employed. Based on the
assumption that similar molecules have similar parametrizations, we develop
scoring and ranking algorithms to classify solute molecules. Four sets of
radius parameters are combined with four sets of charge force fields to arrive
at a total of 16 different parametrizations for the Poisson model. A large
database with 668 experimental data is utilized to validate the proposed
protocol. The lowest leave-one-out root mean square (RMS) error for the
database is 1.33k cal/mol. Additionally, five subsets of the database, i.e.,
SAMPL0-SAMPL4, are employed to further demonstrate that the proposed protocol
offers some of the best solvation predictions. The optimal RMS errors are 0.93,
2.82, 1.90, 0.78, and 1.03 kcal/mol, respectively for SAMPL0, SAMPL1, SAMPL2,
SAMPL3, and SAMPL4 test sets. These results are some of the best, to our best
knowledge.

synaptic plasticity phenomena in neural networks. It is today well established
in biology that the synapses or connections between certain types of neurons
are strengthened when the neurons are co-active, a form of the so called
synaptic plasticity. Such mechanism is believed to mediate the formation and
maintenance of memories. The proposed model describes some features from that
phenomenon. Together with the spin-flip dynamics, in our model the coupling
constants are also subject to stochastic dynamics, so that they interact with
each other. The evolution of the system is described by a continuous-time
Markov jump process.

1607.06251	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Next generation neural mass models	"  Neural mass models have been actively used since the 1970s to model the
coarse grained activity of large populations of neurons and synapses. They have
proven especially useful in understanding brain rhythms. However, although
motivated by neurobiological considerations they are phenomenological in
nature, and cannot hope to recreate some of the rich repertoire of responses
seen in real neuronal tissue. In this chapter we consider the $\theta$-neuron
model that has recently been shown to admit to an exact mean-field description
for instantaneous pulsatile interactions. We show that the inclusion of a more
realistic synapse model leads to a mean-field model that has many of the
features of a neural mass model coupled to a further dynamical equation that
describes the evolution of network synchrony. A bifurcation analysis is used to
uncover the primary mechanism for generating oscillations at the single and two
population level. Numerical simulations also show that the phenomena of event
related synchronisation and desynchronisation are easily realised. Importantly
unlike its phenomenological counterpart this \textit{next generation neural
mass model} is an exact macroscopic description of an underlying microscopic
spiking neurodynamics, and is a natural candidate for use in future large scale
human brain simulations.

1607.06285	q-bio	q-bio.PE cs.DS	Do branch lengths help to locate a tree in a phylogenetic network?	"  Phylogenetic networks are increasingly used in evolutionary biology to
represent the history of species that have undergone reticulate events such as
horizontal gene transfer, hybrid speciation and recombination. One of the most
fundamental questions that arise in this context is whether the evolution of a
gene with one copy in all species can be explained by a given network. In
mathematical terms, this is often translated in the following way: is a given
phylogenetic tree contained in a given phylogenetic network? Recently this tree
containment problem has been widely investigated from a computational
perspective, but most studies have only focused on the topology of the phylo-
genies, ignoring a piece of information that, in the case of phylogenetic
trees, is routinely inferred by evolutionary analyses: branch lengths. These
measure the amount of change (e.g., nucleotide substitutions) that has occurred
along each branch of the phylogeny. Here, we study a number of versions of the
tree containment problem that explicitly account for branch lengths. We show
that, although length information has the potential to locate more precisely a
tree within a network, the problem is computationally hard in its most general
form. On a positive note, for a number of special cases of biological
relevance, we provide algorithms that solve this problem efficiently. This
includes the case of networks of limited complexity, for which it is possible
to recover, among the trees contained by the network with the same topology as
the input tree, the closest one in terms of branch lengths.

modification of the hydrogen bonding network of water which protects
biomolecules through lowered water activity at the protein interface. Using
ultrafast fluorescence spectroscopy we measured the relaxation of bulk water
dynamics around the induced dipole moment of two fluorescent probes (Lucifer
Yellow Ethylenediamine and Tryptophan). Our results indicate a reduction in
bulk water reorganization rate of approximately of 30%. We observe this
retardation in the low concentration regime measured at 0.1M and 0.25 M, far
below the onset of glassy dynamics. This reduction in water activity could be
significant in crowded biological systems, contributing to global change in
protein energy landscape, resulting in a significant enhancement of protein
stability under environmental stress. We observed similar dynamic reduction for
two disaccharide osmolytes, sucrose and trehalose, with trehalose being the
more effective dynamic reducer.

The $k$-mer counting problem is to build a histogram of all substrings of
length $k$ in a given genome sequence. We present the open source $k$-mer
counting software Gerbil that has been designed for the efficient counting of
$k$-mers for $k\geq32$. Given the technology trend towards long reads of
next-generation sequencers, support for large $k$ becomes increasingly
important. While existing $k$-mer counting tools suffer from excessive memory
resource consumption or degrading performance for large $k$, Gerbil is able to
efficiently support large $k$ without much loss of performance. Our software
implements a two-disk approach. In the first step, DNA reads are loaded from
disk and distributed to temporary files that are stored at a working disk. In a
second step, the temporary files are read again, split into $k$-mers and
counted via a hash table approach. In addition, Gerbil can optionally use GPUs
to accelerate the counting step. For large $k$, we outperform state-of-the-art
open source $k$-mer counting tools for large genome data sets.

regional disease and 17% when tumors have metastasized, that is, spread to
distant sites. Furthermore, the incidence of melanoma has been rising by about
3% per year, whereas the incidence of cancers that are more common is
decreasing. A handful of targeted therapies have recently become available that
have finally shown real promise for treatment, but for reasons that remain
unclear only a fraction of patients respond long term. These drugs often
increase survival by only a few months in metastatic patient groups before
relapse occurs. More effective treatment may be possible if a diagnosis can be

of improving the pregnancy monitoring. Here we propose a new approach based on
the functional connectivity between multichannel (4x4 matrix) EHG signals
recorded from the women abdomen. The proposed pipeline includes i) the
computation of the statistical couplings between the multichannel EHG signals,
ii) the characterization of the connectivity matrices, computed by using the
imaginary part of the coherence, based on the graph-theory analysis and iii)
the use of these measures for pregnancy monitoring. The method was evaluated on
a dataset of EHGs, in order to track the correlation between EHGs collected by
each electrode of the matrix (called node-wise analysis) and follow their
evolution along weeks before labor. Results showed that the strength of each
node significantly increases from pregnancy to labor. Electrodes located on the
median vertical axis of the uterus seemed to be the more discriminant. We
speculate that the network-based analysis can be a very promising tool to
improve pregnancy monitoring.

Here we use both exact and stochastic techniques on the lattice Ising model to

generalized susceptibilities, such a protein's activity becomes strongly
influenced by perturbations that influence the two relevant parameters of the
critical point, especially the critical temperature. In addition, the protein's

defying simple explanation, and indeed requires deeper neurophysiological
investigations to gain a better understanding. The current study makes an
attempt in that direction to explore the effect of context on music perception.
To investigate the same, we measured Galvanic Skin Responses (GSR) and
self-reported emotion on 18 participants while listening to different Ragas
(musical stimulus) composed of different Rasa's (emotional expression) in the
different context (Neutral, Pleasant, and Unpleasant). The IAPS pictures were
used to induce the emotional context in participants. Our results from this
study suggest that the context can modulate emotional response in music
perception but only for a shorter time scale. Interestingly, here we
demonstrate by combining GSR and self-reports that this effect gradually
vanishes over time and shows emotional adaptation irrespective of context. The
overall findings suggest that specific context effects of music perception are
transitory in nature and gets saturated on a longer time scale.

important implications in various fields such as systems and synthetic biology.
Various regulation motifs have been discovered or posited over the recent
years, the most recent one being the so-called Antithetic Integral Control
(AIC) motif in Briat et al. (Cell Systems, 2016). Several favorable properties
for the AIC motif have been demonstrated for classes of reaction networks that
satisfy certain irreducibility, ergodicity and output controllability
conditions. Here we address the problem of verifying these conditions for large
sets of reaction networks with fixed topology using two different approaches.
The first one is quantitative and relies on the notion of interval matrices
while the second one is qualitative and is based on sign properties of
matrices. The obtained results lie in the same spirit as those obtained in
Briat et al. (Cell Systems, 2016) where properties of reaction networks are
independently characterized in terms of control theoretic concepts, linear

  External Stimuli in An Inhomogeneous Small-World Complex Neuronal Network"	"  We consider an inhomogeneous small-world network (SWN) composed of inhibitory
short-range (SR) and long-range (LR) interneurons. By varying the fraction of
LR interneurons $p_{long}$, we investigate the effect of network architecture
on emergence of sparsely synchronized rhythms, and make comparison with that in
the Watts-Strogatz SWN. Although SR and LR interneurons have the same average
in- and out-degrees, their betweenness centralities (characterizing the
potentiality in controlling communication between other interneurons) are
distinctly different. Hence, in view of the betweenness, SWNs we consider are
inhomogeneous, unlike the ""canonical"" Watts-Strogatz SWN with nearly same
betweenness centralities. As $p_{long}$ is increased, the average path length
becomes shorter, and the load of communication traffic is less concentrated on
LR interneurons, which leads to better efficiency of global communication
between interneurons. Eventually, when passing a critical value
$p_{long}^{(c)}$ $(\simeq 0.16)$, sparsely synchronized rhythms are found to
emerge. We also consider two cases of external time-periodic stimuli applied to
sub-groups of LR and SR interneurons, respectively. Dynamical responses (such
as synchronization suppression and enhancement) to these two cases of stimuli
are studied and discussed in relation to the betweenness centralities of
stimulated interneurons, representing the effectiveness for transfer of
stimulation effect in the whole network.

ribosomes. According to recent experimental data, we reduce the complexity of
the ribosome and propose a model to express its activity in six main states.
Using our model, we study the translation rate in different biological relevant
situations in the presence of external force, and translation through the RNA
double stranded region in the absence or presence of the external force. In the
present study, we give a quantitative theory for translation rate and show that
the ribosome behaves more like a Brownian Ratchet motor. Our findings could
shed some light on understanding behaviors of the ribosome in biological
conditions.

1607.07244	q-bio	q-bio.MN	"A model for the integration of conflicting exogenous and endogenous
  signals by dendritic cells"	"  Cells of the immune system are confronted with opposing pro- and
anti-inflammatory signals. Dendritic cells (DC) integrate these cues to make
informed decisions whether to initiate an immune response. Confronted with
exogenous microbial stimuli, DC endogenously produce both anti- (IL-10) and
pro-inflammatory (TNF$\alpha$) cues whose joint integration controls the cell's
final decision. We combine experimental measurements with theoretical modeling
to quantitatively describe the integration mode of these opposing signals. We
propose a two step integration model that modulates the effect of the two types
of signals: an initial bottleneck integrates both signals (IL-10 and
TNF$\alpha$), the output of which is later modulated by the anti-inflammatory
signal. We show that the anti-inflammatory IL-10 signaling is long ranged, as
opposed to the short-ranged pro-inflammatory TNF$\alpha$ signaling. The model
suggests that the population averaging and modulation of the pro-inflammatory
response by the anti-inflammatory signal is a safety guard against excessive
immune responses.

Here, a strategy consisting of manipulating a pro and anti-inflammatory
mediator is considered. Already existing and promising model-based techniques
suffer unfortunately from a most difficult calibration. This is due to the
different types of inflammations and to the strong parameter variation between
patients. This communication explores another route via the new model-free
control and its corresponding ""intelligent"" controllers. A ""virtual"" patient,
i.e., a mathematical model, is only employed for digital simulations. A most
interesting feature of our control strategy is the fact that the two outputs
which must be driven are sensorless. This difficulty is overcome by assigning
suitable reference trajectories to two other outputs with sensors. Several most
encouraging computer simulations, corresponding to different drug treatment
strategies, are displayed and discussed.

qnumbers, is used to study the genetic code(s). After considering two kinds of
q-numbers, for comparison, a phenomenological classification scheme of the

Next, numbers describing the presence of additional amino acids, such as
Selenocysteine or/and Pyrrolysine, are also produced. Finally, a minimal number
of amino acids, which could fit the small number of them which are thought to
have been involved, at the origin of life on Earth, is found. All together,
these results constitute our final semi-phenomenological model.

1607.07474	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Generalization of the Ewens sampling formula to arbitrary fitness
  landscapes"	"  In considering evolution of transcribed regions, regulatory modules, and
other genomic loci of interest, we are often faced with a situation in which
the number of allelic states greatly exceeds the population size. In this
limit, the population eventually adopts a steady state characterized by
mutation-selection-drift balance. Although new alleles continue to be explored
through mutation, the statistics of the population, and in particular the
probabilities of seeing specific allelic configurations in samples taken from a
population, do not change with time. In the absence of selection, probabilities
of allelic configurations are given by the Ewens sampling formula, widely used
in population genetics to detect deviations from neutrality. Here we develop an
extension of this formula to arbitrary, possibly epistatic, fitness landscapes.
Although our approach is general, we focus on the class of landscapes in which
alleles are grouped into two, three, or several fitness states. This class of
landscapes yields sampling probabilities that are computationally more
tractable, and can form a basis for the inference of selection signatures from
sequence data. We demonstrate that, for a sizeable range of mutation rates and
selection coefficients, the steady-state allelic diversity is not neutral.
Therefore, it may be used to infer selection coefficients, as well as other key
evolutionary parameters, using high-throughput sequencing of evolving
populations to collect data on locus polymorphisms. We also find that our
theory remains sufficiently accurate even if the assumptions such as the
infinite allele limit and the ""full connectivity"" assumption in which each
allele can mutate into any other allele are relaxed. Thus, our framework
establishes a theoretical foundation for inferring selection signatures from
samples of sequences produced by evolution on epistatic fitness landscapes.

1607.07503	q-bio	q-bio.GN q-bio.QM	Genomic data analysis in tree spaces	"  Recently, an elegant approach in phylogenetics was introduced by
Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann that allows a systematic comparison of different
evolutionary histories using the metric geometry of tree spaces. In many
problem settings one encounters heavily populated phylogenetic trees, where the
large number of leaves encumbers visualization and analysis in the relevant
evolutionary moduli spaces. To address this issue, we introduce tree
dimensionality reduction, a structured approach to reducing large phylogenetic
trees to a distribution of smaller trees. We prove a stability theorem ensuring
that small perturbations of the large trees are taken to small perturbations of
the resulting distributions.
  We then present a series of four biologically motivated applications to the
analysis of genomic data, spanning cancer and infectious disease. The first
quantifies how chemotherapy can disrupt the evolution of common leukemias. The
second examines a link between geometric information and the histologic grade
in relapsed gliomas, where longer relapse branches were specific to high grade
glioma. The third concerns genetic stability of xenograft models of cancer,
where heterogeneity at the single cell level increased with later mouse
passages. The last studies genetic diversity in seasonal influenza A virus. We
apply tree dimensionality reduction to 24 years of longitudinally collected
H3N2 hemagglutinin sequences, generating distributions of smaller trees
spanning between three and five seasons. A negative correlation is observed
between the influenza vaccine effectiveness during a season and the variance of
the distributions produced using preceding seasons' sequence data. We also show
how tree distributions relate to antigenic clusters and choice of influenza
vaccine. Our formalism exposes links between viral genomic data and clinical
observables such as vaccine selection and efficacy.

  during atrial fibrillation"	"  Although atrial fibrillation (AF), a common arrhythmia, frequently presents
in patients with underlying valvular disease, its hemodynamic contributions are
not fully understood. The present work aimed to computationally study how
physical conditions imposed by pathologic valvular anatomy act on AF
hemodynamics. We simulated AF with different severity grades of left-sided
valvular diseases and compared the cardiovascular effects that they exert
during AF, compared to lone AF. The fluid dynamics model used here has been
recently validated for lone AF and relies on a lumped parameterization of the
four heart chambers, together with the systemic and pulmonary circulation.
Three different grades of severity (mild, moderate, severe) were analyzed for
each of the four valvulopathies (aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, aortic
regurgitation, mitral regurgitation). Regurgitation was hemodynamically more
relevant than stenosis, as the latter led to inefficient cardiac flow, while
the former introduced more drastic fluid dynamics variation. Moreover, mitral
valvulopathies were more significant than aortic ones. In case of aortic valve
diseases, proper mitral functioning damps out changes at atrial and pulmonary
levels. In the case of mitral valvulopathy, the mitral valve lost its
regulating capability, thus hemodynamic variations almost equally affected
regions upstream and downstream of the valve. The present study revealed that
both mitral and aortic regurgitation strongly affect hemodynamics, followed by
mitral stenosis, while aortic stenosis has the least impact among the analyzed
valvular diseases. The proposed approach can provide new mechanistic insights
as to which valvular pathologies merit more aggressive treatment of AF. Present
findings, if clinically confirmed, hold the potential to impact AF management
(e.g., adoption of a rhythm control strategy) in specific valvular diseases.

  stability correlates with folding rates"	"  We assume that the protein folding process follows two autonomous steps: the
conformational search for the native, mainly ruled by the hydrophobic effect;
and, the final adjustment stage, which eventually gives stability to the
native. Our main tool of investigation is a 3D lattice model provided with a
ten-letter alphabet, the stereochemical model. This model was conceived for
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations when one keeps in mind the kinetic behavior of
protein-like chains in solution. In order to characterize the folding
characteristic time ({\tau}) by two distinct sampling methods, first we present
two sets of 10^{3} MC simulations for a fast protein-like sequence. For these
sets of folding times, {\tau} and {\tau}_{q} were obtained with the application
of the standard Metropolis algorithm (MA), and a modified algorithm (M_{q}A).
The results for {\tau}_{q}reveal two things: i) the hydrophobic chain-solvent
interactions plus a set of inter-residues steric constraints are enough to
emulate the first stage of the process: for each one of the 10^{3} MC performed
simulations, the native is always found without exception, ii) the ratio
{\tau}_{q}/{\tau}~1/3 suggests that the effect of local thermal fluctuations,
encompassed by the Tsallis weight, provides an innate efficiency to the chain
escapes from energetic and steric traps. ...

  specificity and accuracy?"	"  Large amounts of electronic medical records collected by hospitals across the
developed world offer unprecedented possibilities for knowledge discovery using
computer based data mining and machine learning. Notwithstanding significant
research efforts, the use of this data in the prediction of disease development
has largely been disappointing. In this paper we examine in detail a recently
proposed method which has in preliminary experiments demonstrated highly
promising results on real-world data. We scrutinize the authors' claims that
the proposed model is scalable and investigate whether the tradeoff between
prediction specificity (i.e. the ability of the model to predict a wide number
of different ailments) and accuracy (i.e. the ability of the model to make the
correct prediction) is practically viable. Our experiments conducted on a data
corpus of nearly 3,000,000 admissions support the authors' expectations and
demonstrate that the high prediction accuracy is maintained well even when the
number of admission types explicitly included in the model is increased to
account for 98% of all admissions in the corpus. Thus several promising
directions for future work are highlighted.

complex disorders and rare variants with low minor allele frequencies. One of
the major challenges in rare variant testing is lack of statistical power of
traditional testing methods due to extremely low variances of single nucleotide
polymorphisms. In this paper, we introduce a W-test collapsing method that
evaluates the distributional differences in cases and controls using a combined
log of odds ratio. The proposed method is compared with the Weighted-Sum
Statistic and Sequence Kernel Association Test using simulation data sets and
showed better performances and faster computing speed. In the study of real
next generation sequencing data set of hypertensive disorder, we identified
genes of interesting biological functions that are associated to metabolism
disorder and inflammation, which include the MACROD1, NLRP7, AGK, PAK6 and
APBB1. The W-test collapsing method offers a fast, effective and alternative

  interactions"	"  The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process plays a major role in the analysis of the
evolution of phenotypic traits along phylogenies. The standard OU process
includes drift and stabilizing selection and assumes that species evolve
independently. However, especially in plants, there is ample evidence of
hybridization and introgression during evolution. In this work we present a
statistical approach with analytical solutions that allows for the inclusion of
adaptation and migration in a common phylogenetic framework. We furthermore
present a detailed simulation study that clearly indicates the adverse effects
of ignoring migration. Similarity between species due to migration could be
misinterpreted as very strong convergent evolution without proper correction
for these additional dependencies. Our model can also be useful for studying
local adaptation among populations within the same species. Finally, we show
that our model can be interpreted in terms of ecological interactions between
species, providing a general framework for the evolution of traits between
""interacting"" species or populations.

  Classification using STN-LFP Signal"	"  Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has gained increasing attention as an effective
method to mitigate Parkinsons disease (PD) disorders. Existing DBS systems are
open-loop such that the system parameters are not adjusted automatically based
on patients behavior. Classification of human behavior is an important step in
the design of the next generation of DBS systems that are closed-loop. This
paper presents a classification approach to recognize such behavioral tasks
using the subthalamic nucleus (STN) Local Field Potential (LFP) signals. In our
approach, we use the time-frequency representation (spectrogram) of the raw LFP
signals recorded from left and right STNs as the feature vectors. Then these
features are combined together via Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Multiple
Kernel Learning (MKL) formulation. The MKL-based classification method is
utilized to classify different tasks: button press, mouth movement, speech, and
arm movement. Our experiments show that the lp-norm MKL significantly
outperforms single kernel SVM-based classifiers in classifying behavioral tasks
of five subjects even using signals acquired with a low sampling rate of 10 Hz.
This leads to a lower computational cost.

  scales: application to multiscale modelling of DNA dynamics"	"  A multi-resolution bead-spring model for polymer dynamics is developed as a
generalization of the Rouse model. A polymer chain is described using beads of
variable sizes connected by springs with variable spring constants. A numerical
scheme which can use different timesteps to advance the positions of different
beads is presented and analyzed. The position of a particular bead is only
updated at integer multiples of the timesteps associated with its connecting
springs. This approach extends the Rouse model to a multiscale model on both
spatial and temporal scales, allowing simulations of localized regions of a
polymer chain with high spatial and temporal resolution, while using a coarser
modelling approach to describe the rest of the polymer chain. A method for
changing the model resolution on-the-fly is developed using the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. It is shown that this approach maintains key
statistics of the end-to-end distance and diffusion of the polymer filament and
makes computational savings when applied to a model for the binding of a
protein to the DNA filament.

  universal Turing machine using DNA"	"  The theory of computer science is based around Universal Turing Machines
(UTMs): abstract machines able to execute all possible algorithms. Modern
digital computers are physical embodiments of UTMs. The nondeterministic
polynomial (NP) time complexity class of problems is the most significant in
computer science, and an efficient (i.e. polynomial P) way to solve such
problems would be of profound economic and social importance. By definition
nondeterministic UTMs (NUTMs) solve NP complete problems in P time. However,
NUTMs have previously been believed to be physically impossible to construct.
Thue string rewriting systems are computationally equivalent to UTMs, and are
naturally nondeterministic. Here we describe the physical design for a NUTM
that implements a universal Thue system. The design exploits the ability of DNA
to replicate to execute an exponential number of computational paths in P time.
Each Thue rewriting step is embodied in a DNA edit implemented using a novel
combination of polymerase chain reactions and site-directed mutagenesis. We
demonstrate that this design works using both computational modelling and in
vitro molecular biology experimentation. The current design has limitations,
such as restricted error-correction. However, it opens up the prospect of
engineering NUTM based computers able to outperform all standard computers on
important practical problems.

  photoplethysmographic imaging systems"	"  Photolethysmographic imaging (PPGI) is a widefield non-contact biophotonic
technology able to remotely monitor cardiovascular function over anatomical
areas. Though spatial context can provide increased physiological insight,
existing PPGI systems rely on coarse spatial averaging with no anatomical
priors for assessing arterial pulsatility. Here, we developed a continuous
probabilistic pulsatility model for importance-weighted blood pulse waveform
extraction. Using a data-driven approach, the model was constructed using a 23
participant sample with large demographic variation (11/12 female/male, age
11-60 years, BMI 16.4-35.1 kg$\cdot$m$^{-2}$). Using time-synchronized
ground-truth waveforms, spatial correlation priors were computed and projected
into a co-aligned importance-weighted Cartesian space. A modified
Parzen-Rosenblatt kernel density estimation method was used to compute the
continuous resolution-agnostic probabilistic pulsatility model. The model
identified locations that consistently exhibited pulsatility across the sample.
Blood pulse waveform signals extracted with the model exhibited significantly
stronger temporal correlation ($W=35,p<0.01$) and spectral SNR ($W=31,p<0.01$)
compared to uniform spatial averaging. Heart rate estimation was in strong
agreement with true heart rate ($r^2=0.9619$, error $(\mu,\sigma)=(0.52,1.69)$

condition of a biological system is a key element of precision medicine. Indeed
it allows to tailor diagnostic, prognostic and treatment choice to individual
characteristics of a patient. In machine learning terms, biomarker discovery
can be framed as a feature selection problem on whole-genome data sets.
However, classical feature selection methods are usually underpowered to
process these data sets, which contain orders of magnitude more features than
samples. This can be addressed by making the assumption that genetic features
that are linked on a biological network are more likely to work jointly towards
explaining the phenotype of interest. We review here three families of methods
for feature selection that integrate prior knowledge in the form of networks.

transplantation (SCT). Seventy seven SCT donor-recipient pairs (DRP) (HLA
matched unrelated donor (MUD), n=50; matched related donor (MRD), n=27)
underwent whole exome sequencing to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) generating alloreactive peptide libraries for each DRP (9-mer
peptide-HLA complexes); Human CMV CROSS (Cross-Reactive Open Source Sequence)
Database was compiled from NCBI; HLA class I binding affinity for each DRPs HLA
was calculated by NetMHCpan 2.8 and hCMV- derived 9-mers algorithmically
compared to the alloreactive peptide-HLA complex libraries. Short consecutive
(6 or greater) amino acid (AA) sequence homology matching hCMV to recipient
peptides was considered for HLA-bound-peptide (IC50<500 nM) cross reactivity.
Of the 70,686 hCMV 9-mers contained within the hCMV CROSS database, 29,658.8
+/- 9038.5 were found to match MRD DRP alloreactive peptides and 52,910.2 +/-
16121.8 matched MUD DRP peptides (Student's T-test, p<0.001). In silico
analysis revealed multiple high affinity, immunogenic CMV-Human peptide matches
(IC50<500 nM) expressed in GVHD-affected tissue-specific manner (proteins
expressed at 10 RPKM or greater). hCMV+GVHD was found in 18 patients, 13
developing hCMV viremia before GVHD onset with a subset analysis of 7 instances
of hCMV viremia prior to acute GVHD onset (n=3), chronic GVHD (n=2) and acute +
chronic GVHD (n=2) indicating cross reactive peptide expression within affected
organs. We propose that based on our analysis and preliminary clinical
correlations that hCMV immune cross-reactivity may cause antigenic mimicry of
human alloreactive peptides triggering GVHD.

  source reconstruction"	"  Source imaging based on magnetoencephalography (MEG) and
electroencephalography (EEG) allows for the non-invasive analysis of brain
activity with high temporal and good spatial resolution. As the
bioelectromagnetic inverse problem is ill-posed, constraints are required. For
the analysis of evoked brain activity, spatial sparsity of the neuronal
activation is a common assumption. It is often taken into account using convex
constraints based on the l1-norm. The resulting source estimates are however
biased in amplitude and often suboptimal in terms of source selection due to
high correlations in the forward model. In this work, we demonstrate that an
inverse solver based on a block-separable penalty with a Frobenius norm per
block and a l0.5-quasinorm over blocks addresses both of these issues. For
solving the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we propose the iterative
reweighted Mixed Norm Estimate (irMxNE), an optimization scheme based on
iterative reweighted convex surrogate optimization problems, which are solved
efficiently using a block coordinate descent scheme and an active set strategy.
We compare the proposed sparse imaging method to the dSPM and the RAP-MUSIC
approach based on two MEG data sets. We provide empirical evidence based on
simulations and analysis of MEG data that the proposed method improves on the
standard Mixed Norm Estimate (MxNE) in terms of amplitude bias, support
recovery, and stability.

maintain the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Mitochondria are the major
sub-cellular organelle of ATP production. With a negative inner membrane
potential, mitochondria take up Ca2+ from their surroundings, a process called
mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Under physiological conditions, Ca2+ uptake into
mitochondria promotes ATP production. Excessive uptake causes mitochondrial
Ca2+ overload, which activates downstream adverse responses leading to cell
dysfunction. Moreover, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake could shape spatio-temporal
patterns of intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Malfunction of mitochondrial Ca2+
uptake is implicated in muscle degeneration. Unlike non-excitable cells,
mitochondria in muscle cells experience dramatic changes of intracellular Ca2+
levels. Besides the sudden elevation of Ca2+ level induced by action
potentials, Ca2+ transients in muscle cells can be as short as a few
milliseconds during a single twitch or as long as minutes during tetanic
contraction, which raises the question whether mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is
fast and big enough to shape intracellular Ca2+ signaling during
excitation-contraction coupling and creates technical challenges for
quantification of the dynamic changes of Ca2+ inside mitochondria. This review
focuses on characterization of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in skeletal muscle and
its role in muscle physiology and diseases.

attitude. To determine whether evolutionary advantages might be stemming from
diverse levels of tolerance in a population, we study a spatial public goods
game, where in addition to cooperators, defectors, and loners, tolerant players
are also present. Depending on the number of defectors within a group, a
tolerant player can either cooperate in or abstain from a particular instance
of the game. We show that the diversity of tolerance can give rise to
synergistic effects, wherein players with a different threshold in terms of the
tolerated number of defectors in a group compete most effectively against
defection and default abstinence. Such synergistic associations can stabilise
states of full cooperation where otherwise defection would dominate. We observe
complex pattern formation that gives rise to an intricate phase diagram, where
invisible yet stable strategy alliances require outmost care lest they are
overlooked. Our results highlight the delicate importance of diversity and
tolerance for the provisioning of public goods, and they reveal fascinating
subtleties of the spatiotemporal dynamics that is due to the competition of
subsystem solutions in structured populations.

aware of the rise in anti-vaccine sentiment. Vaccinations have numerous health
benefits for immunized individuals as well as for the general public through
herd immunity. Given the rise in immunization-preventable diseases, a
consequence of people opting out of their routine vaccinations, we determined
that Canadian health data can identify individuals over the age of 60 who chose
not to get vaccinated (80.1% negative predictive value) and individuals under
the age of 60 who have recently been vaccinated (96.4% positive predictive
value). Using the 2009-2014 Canadian Community Health Surveys (CCHS), a probit
model identified the variables that were most commonly associated with flu
vaccination outcomes. Of 1,381 variables, 47 with the most significant marginal
effects were selected, including the presence of diseases (e.g. diabetes and
cancer), behavioral characteristics (e.g. smoking and exercise), exposure to
the medical system (e.g. whether the individual gets a regular check-up), and a
person's living situation (e.g. having young children in the household). These
variables were then used to generate a Random Forest classification model,
trained on the 2009-2013 dataset, and tested on the 2014 dataset. We achieved
an overall accuracy of 87.8% between the two final models, each using 25
classification trees with bounded depth of 20 nodes, randomly selecting from

to efficiently allocate vaccination promotion efforts. Additionally, it can be

1607.08877	q-bio	stat.ML q-bio.QM	The Phylogenetic LASSO and the Microbiome	"  Scientific investigations that incorporate next generation sequencing involve
analyses of high-dimensional data where the need to organize, collate and
interpret the outcomes are pressingly important. Currently, data can be
collected at the microbiome level leading to the possibility of personalized
medicine whereby treatments can be tailored at this scale. In this paper, we
lay down a statistical framework for this type of analysis with a view toward
synthesis of products tailored to individual patients. Although the paper
applies the technique to data for a particular infectious disease, the
methodology is sufficiently rich to be expanded to other problems in medicine,
especially those in which coincident `-omics' covariates and clinical responses
are simultaneously captured.

copolymers in water (or polymersomes) to encapsulate myoglobin varying the
vesicle size, and protein concentration. We show that confinement within
polymersomes leads to a significant improvement in protein stability against
thermal denaturation up to 95degC at neutral pH, with little or no evidence of
unfolding or reduced enzymatic activity. The latter parameter actually exhibits
a two-fold increase after thermal cycling when the confined protein
concentration is higher than 5% v/v. Our results suggest that nanoscopic
confinement is a promising new avenue for the enhanced long-term storage of
proteins. Moreover, our work has potentially important implications for the
origin of life, since such compartmentalisation may well have been critical for
ensuring the preservation of early functional proteins under relatively harsh
conditions, thus playing a key role in the subsequent emergence of primitive
life forms.

  Performance"	"  Studies in recent years have demonstrated that neural organization and
structure impact an individual's ability to perform a given task. Specifically,
individuals with greater neural efficiency have been shown to outperform those
with less organized functional structure. In this work, we compare the
predictive ability of properties of neural connectivity on a working memory
task. We provide two novel approaches for characterizing functional network
connectivity from electroencephalography (EEG), and compare these features to
the average power across frequency bands in EEG channels. Our first novel
approach represents functional connectivity structure through the distribution
of eigenvalues making up channel coherence matrices in multiple frequency
bands. Our second approach creates a connectivity network at each frequency
band, and assesses variability in average path lengths of connected components
and degree across the network. Failures in digit and sentence recall on single
trials are detected using a Gaussian classifier for each feature set, at each
frequency band. The classifier results are then fused across frequency bands,
with the resulting detection performance summarized using the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) statistic. Fused AUC results of
0.63/0.58/0.61 for digit recall failure and 0.58/0.59/0.54 for sentence recall
failure are obtained from the connectivity structure, graph variability, and
channel power features respectively.

  timing"	"  The synaptic connectivity of cortex is plastic, with experience shaping the
ongoing interactions between neurons. Theoretical studies of spike
timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) have focused on either just pairs of neurons
or large-scale simulations where analytic insight is lacking. A simple account
for how fast spike time correlations affect both micro- and macroscopic network
structure remains lacking. We develop a low-dimensional mean field theory
showing how STDP gives rise to strongly coupled assemblies of neurons with
shared stimulus preferences, with the connectivity actively reinforced by spike
train correlations during spontaneous dynamics. Furthermore, the stimulus
coding by cell assemblies is actively maintained by these internally generated
spiking correlations, suggesting a new role for noise correlations in neural
coding. Assembly formation has often been associated with firing rate-based
plasticity schemes; our theory provides an alternative and complementary
framework, where temporal correlations and STDP form and actively maintain
learned structure in cortical networks.

  by a fluorescent probe assay"	"  Fucoidan is a generic term for a class of fucose rich, structurally diverse
sulfated polysaccharides that are found in brown algae and other marine
organisms. Depending on the species from which the fucoidan is extracted, a
wide variety of biological activities including antitumor, antiinflammatory,
immune-modulating, antiviral, antibacterial and pro- and anticoagulant
activities has been described. Fucoidans have the advantage of low toxicity and
oral bioavailibiity and are viable drug candidates, preclinical and pilot
clinical trials show promising results. The availability of robust assays, in
particular for analysing the blood levels of fucoidan, is a fundamental
requirement for pharmacokinetic analysis in drug development projects. This
contribution describes the application of a commercially availbale,
protein-free fluorescent probe assay (Heparin Red) for the direct
quantification of several fucoidans (from Fucus vesiculosus, Macrocystis
pyrifera, and Undaria pinnatifida) in human plasma. By only minor adapation of
the established protocol for heparin detection, a concentration range 0,5 to 20
microgram per mL fucoidan can be addressed. A preliminary analysis of matrix
effects suggests acceptable interindividual variability and no interference by
endogeneous chondroitin sulfate. This study identifies the Heparin Red assay as
a simple, time-saving mix-and-read method for the quantification of fucoidans
in human plasma.

1608.00431	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Autaptic Connections Shift Network Excitability and Bursting	"  Network architecture forms a critical constraint on neuronal function. Here
we examine the role of structural autapses, when a neuron synapses onto itself,
in driving network-wide bursting behavior. Using a simple spiking model of
neuronal activity, we study how autaptic connections affect activity patterns,
and evaluate if neuronal degree or controllability are significant factors that
affect changes in bursting from these autaptic connections. We observed that
adding increasing numbers of autaptic connections to excitatory neurons
increased the number of spiking events in the network and the number of
network-wide bursts, particularly in the portion of the phase space in which
excitatory synapses were stronger contributors to bursting behavior than
inhibitory synapses. In comparison, autaptic connections to excitatory neurons
with high average controllability led to higher burst frequencies than adding
the same number of self-looping connections to neurons with high modal
controllability. The number of autaptic connections required to induce bursting
behavior could be lowered by selectively adding autapses to high degree
excitatory neurons. These results suggest a role of autaptic connections in
controlling network-wide bursts in diverse cortical and subcortical regions of
mammalian brain. Moreover, they open up new avenues for the study of dynamic
neurophysiological correlates of structural controllability.

  growth"	"  We consider an optimal control problem for a diffuse interface model of tumor
growth. The state equations couples a Cahn-Hilliard equation and a
reaction-diffusion equation, which models the growth of a tumor in the presence
of a nutrient and surrounded by host tissue. The introduction of cytotoxic
drugs into the system serves to eliminate the tumor cells and in this setting
the concentration of the cytotoxic drugs will act as the control variable.
Furthermore, we allow the objective functional to depend on a free time
variable, which represents the unknown treatment time to be optimized. As a
result, we obtain first order necessary optimality conditions for both the
cytotoxic concentration and the treatment time.

  Algorithms"	"  Stochastic Boolean networks, or more generally, stochastic discrete networks,
are an important class of computational models for molecular interaction
networks. The stochasticity stems from the updating schedule. Standard updating
schedules include the synchronous update, where all the nodes are updated at
the same time, and the asynchronous update where a random node is updated at
each time step. The former produces a deterministic dynamics while the latter a
stochastic dynamics. A more general stochastic setting considers propensity
parameters for updating each node. Stochastic Discrete Dynamical Systems (SDDS)
is a modeling framework that considers two propensity parameters for updating
each node and uses one when the update has a positive impact on the variable,
that is, when the update causes the variable to increase its value, and uses
the other when the update has a negative impact, that is, when the update
causes it to decrease its value. This framework offers additional features for
simulations but also adds a complexity in parameter estimation of the
propensities. This paper presents a method for estimating the propensity
parameters for SDDS. The method is based on adding noise to the system using
the Google PageRank approach to make the system ergodic and thus guaranteeing
the existence of a stationary distribution. Then with the use of a genetic
algorithm, the propensity parameters are estimated. Approximation techniques
that make the search algorithms efficient are also presented and Matlab/Octave
code to test the algorithms are available at

regulations, yet effective methods in precisely identifying repetitive elements
in DNA sequences are not fully accessible, and the relationship between
repetitive elements and periodicities of genomes is not clearly understood. We
present an $\textit{ab initio}$ method to quantitatively detect repetitive

method uses the measure of the distribution uniformity of nucleotides at
periodic positions in DNA sequences or genomes. It can identify periodicities,
consensus repeat patterns, copy numbers and perfect levels of repetitive
elements. The results of using the method on different DNA sequences and
genomes demonstrate efficacy and accuracy in identifying repeat patterns and
periodicities. The complexity of the method is linear with respect to the
lengths of the analyzed sequences.

  Defence Response to Genotoxic Stress"	"  This paper proposes that eukaryotic cells, under severe genotoxic stress, can
commit genoautotomy (genome 'self-injury') that involves cutting and releasing
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) fragments from double-stranded DNA and leaving
ssDNA gaps in the genome. The ssDNA gaps could be easily and precisely repaired
later. The released ssDNA fragments may play some role in the regulation of
cell cycle progression. Taken together, genoautotomy causes limited nonlethal
DNA damage, but prevents the whole genome from lethal damage, and thus should
be deemed as a eukaryotic cellular defence response to genotoxic stress.

topologically indistinguishable from normal, healthy stem cells. The question
is why cancer stem cells can be both phenotypically distinct and have
morphological effects so different from normal stem cells. The difference
between cancer stem cells and normal stem cells lies not in differences their
network architecture, but rather in the spatial-temporal locality of their
activation in the genome and the resulting expression in the body. The
metastatic potential cancer stem cells is not based primarily on their network
divergence from normal stem cells, but on non-network based genetic changes
that enable the evolution of gene-based phenotypic properties of the cell that
permit its escape and travel to other parts of the body. Stem cell network
theory allows the precise prediction of stem cell behavioral dynamics and a
mathematical description of stem cell proliferation for both normal and cancer
stem cells. It indicates that the best therapeutic approach is to tackle the
highest order stem cells first, otherwise spontaneous remission of so called
cured cancers will always be a danger. Stem cell networks point to a pathway to
new methods to diagnose and cure not only stem cell cancers but cancers
generally.

interactive visual representations of multiple brain image structures and the

magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data onto 2D surfaces that preserve shape
(angle), extent (area), and spatial (neighborhood) information for 2D (circular
disk) and 3D (spherical) mapping, split these surfaces into separate patches,

of these patches. The resulting visualizations are easier to compute on and
more visually intuitive to interact with than the original data, and facilitate
simultaneous exploration of multiple data sets, modalities, and statistical

  Theory"	"  One of the most fundamental problems in science is to define {\it
quantitatively} the complexity of organized matters, i.e., {\it organized
complexity}. Although many measures have been proposed toward this aim in
previous decades, there is no agreed upon definition. This paper presents a new
quantitative definition of organized complexity. This definition {\it
simultaneously} captures the three major features of complexity: computational
(similar to logical depth), descriptional (similar to the Kolmogorov complexity
and effective complexity) and distributional (similar to statistical
complexity). In addition, the proposed definition is computable and can measure
both probabilistic and deterministic forms of objects in a unified manner. The
proposed definition is based on circuits rather than Turing machines and
$\epsilon$-machines. We give several criteria required for organized complexity
measures and show that the proposed definition satisfies all of them for the
first time. We then apply this quantitative definition to formulate a {\it
semantic information theory}. We present the first formal definition of a {\it
semantic information amount}, which is the core concept of the semantic
information theory, that is based only on concretely defined notions. Previous
semantic information theories defined this amount under some a priori
information which is not concretely specified. We then unveil several
fundamental properties in the semantic information theory, e.g., a semantic
source coding theorem, semantic channel coding theorem, and effectiveness
coding theorem. Although the semantic information theory has a long history of
research going back more than six decades, there has been no study on its
relation to organized complexity. This paper offers the first unified paradigm
of organized complexity and semantic information theory.

  of tumour acidity and vasculature"	"  Background: Tumours are diverse ecosystems with persistent heterogeneity in
various cancer hallmarks like self-sufficiency of growth factor production for
angiogenesis and reprogramming of energy-metabolism for aerobic glycolysis.
This heterogeneity has consequences for diagnosis, treatment, and disease
progression.
  Methods: We introduce the double goods game to study the dynamics of these
traits using evolutionary game theory. We model glycolytic acid production as a
public good for all tumour cells and oxygen from vascularization via VEGF
production as a club good benefiting non-glycolytic tumour cells. This results
in three viable phenotypic strategies: glycolytic, angiogenic, and aerobic
non-angiogenic.
  Results: We classify the dynamics into three qualitatively distinct regimes:
(1) fully glycolytic, (2) fully angiogenic, or (3) polyclonal in all three cell
types. The third regime allows for dynamic heterogeneity even with linear
goods, something that was not possible in prior public good models that
considered glycolysis or growth-factor production in isolation.
  Conclusion: The cyclic dynamics of the polyclonal regime stress the
importance of timing for anti-glycolysis treatments like lonidamine. The
existence of qualitatively different dynamic regimes highlights the order
effects of treatments. In particular, we consider the potential of vascular
renormalization as a neoadjuvant therapy before follow up with interventions
like buffer therapy.

  for the cost of wiring"	"  Brain networks are expected to be modular. However, existing techniques for
estimating a network's modules make it difficult to assess the influence of
organizational principles such as wiring cost reduction on the detected
modules. Here, we present a modification of an existing module detection
algorithm that allows us to focus on connections that are unexpected under a
cost-reduction wiring rule and to identify modules from among these
connections. We apply this technique to anatomical brain networks and show that
the modules we detect differ from those detected using the standard technique.
We demonstrate that these novel modules are spatially distributed, exhibit
unique functional fingerprints, and overlap considerably with rich clubs,
giving rise to an alternative and complementary interpretation of the
functional roles of specific brain regions. Finally, we demonstrate that, using
the modified module detection approach, we can detect modules in a
developmental dataset that track normative patterns of maturation.
Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that brain networks are
composed of modules and provide additional insight into the function of those
modules.

1608.01179	q-bio	q-bio.NC physics.bio-ph	Normalized neural representations of natural odors	"  The olfactory system removes correlations in natural odors using a network of
inhibitory neurons in the olfactory bulb. It has been proposed that this
network integrates the response from all olfactory receptors and inhibits them
equally. However, how such global inhibition influences the neural
representations of odors is unclear. Here, we study a simple statistical model
of this situation, which leads to concentration-invariant, sparse
representations of the odor composition. We show that the inhibition strength
can be tuned to obtain sparse representations that are still useful to
discriminate odors that vary in relative concentration, size, and composition.
The model reveals two generic consequences of global inhibition: (i) odors with
many molecular species are more difficult to discriminate and (ii) receptor
arrays with heterogeneous sensitivities perform badly. Our work can thus help
to understand how global inhibition shapes normalized odor representations for
further processing in the brain.

  transitions from single particle trajectories"	"  The stochastic motions of a diffusing particle contain information concerning
the particle's interactions with binding partners and with its local
environment. However, accurate determination of the underlying diffusive
properties, beyond normal diffusion, has remained challenging when analyzing
particle trajectories on an individual basis. Here, we introduce the maximum
likelihood estimator (MLE) for confined diffusion and fractional Brownian
motion. We demonstrate that this MLE yields improved estimation over
traditional mean square displacement analyses. We also introduce a model
selection scheme (that we call mleBIC) that classifies individual trajectories
to a given diffusion mode. We demonstrate the statistical limitations of
classification via mleBIC using simulated data. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce a new version of perturbation expectation-maximization (pEMv2),
which simultaneously analyzes a collection of particle trajectories to uncover
the system of interactions which give rise to unique normal and/or non-normal
diffusive states within the population. We test and evaluate the performance of
pEMv2 on various sets of simulated particle trajectories, which transition
among several modes of normal and non-normal diffusion, highlighting the key
considerations for employing this analysis methodology.

Since mechanosensory cells in connective tissue are surrounded by a disordered
network of biopolymers, their in vivo mechanical environment can be extremely
heterogeneous. Here, we investigate how this heterogeneity impacts
mechanosensing by modeling the cell as an idealized local stiffness sensor
inside a disordered fiber network. For all types of networks we study,
including experimentally-imaged collagen and fibrin architectures, we find that
measurements applied at different points throughout a given network yield a
strikingly broad range of local stiffnesses, spanning roughly two decades. We
verify via simulations and scaling arguments that this broad range of local
stiffnesses is a generic property of disordered fiber networks, and show that
the range can be further increased by tuning specific network features,
including the presence of long fibers and the proximity to elastic transitions.
These features additionally allow for a highly tunable dependence of stiffness
on probe length. Finally, we show that to obtain optimal, reliable estimates of
global tissue stiffness, a cell must adjust its size, shape, and position to
integrate multiple stiffness measurements over extended regions of space.

geometry is used, the non-Newtonian effects manifest insignificant, while the
vessel is considered to be medium to small which, according to the literature,
suggest a strict use of non-Newtonian formulation. The insignificance of the

  measurements"	"  High-resolution functional imaging is providing increasingly rich
measurements of brain activity in animals and humans. A major challenge is to
leverage such data to gain insight into the brain's computational mechanisms.
The first step is to define candidate brain-computational models (BCMs) that
can perform the behavioural task in question. We would then like to infer,
which of the candidate BCMs best accounts for measured brain-activity data.
Here we describe a method that complements each BCM by a measurement model
(MM), which simulates the way the brain-activity measurements reflect neuronal
activity (e.g. local averaging in fMRI voxels or sparse sampling in array
recordings). The resulting generative model (BCM-MM) produces simulated
measurements. In order to avoid having to fit the MM to predict each individual
measurement channel of the brain-activity data, we compare the measured and
predicted data at the level of summary statistics. We describe a novel
particular implementation of this approach, called probabilistic RSA (pRSA)
with measurement models, which uses representational dissimilarity matrices
(RDMs) as the summary statistics. We validate this method by simulations of
fMRI measurements (locally averaging voxels) based on a deep convolutional
neural network for visual object recognition. Results indicate that the way the
measurements sample the activity patterns strongly affects the apparent
representational dissimilarities. However, modelling of the measurement process
can account for these effects and different BCMs remain distinguishable even
under substantial noise. The pRSA method enables us to perform Bayesian
inference on the set of BCMs and to recognise the data-generating model in each
case.

localized most AJs along major ancient trade routes in northeastern Turkey

1608.02083	q-bio	cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.PE	Rare events in stochastic populations under bursty reproduction	"  Recently, a first step was made by the authors towards a systematic
investigation of the effect of reaction-step-size noise - uncertainty in the
step size of the reaction - on the dynamics of stochastic populations. This was
done by investigating the effect of bursty influx on the switching dynamics of
stochastic populations. Here we extend this formalism to account for bursty
reproduction processes, and improve the accuracy of the formalism to include
subleading-order corrections. Bursty reproduction appears in various contexts,
where notable examples include bursty viral production from infected cells, and
reproduction of mammals involving varying number of offspring. The main
question we quantitatively address is how bursty reproduction affects the
overall fate of the population. We consider two complementary scenarios:
population extinction and population survival; in the former a population gets
extinct after maintaining a long-lived metastable state, whereas in the latter
a population proliferates despite undergoing a deterministic drift towards
extinction. In both models reproduction occurs in bursts, sampled from an
arbitrary distribution. In the extinction problem, we show that bursty
reproduction broadens the quasi-stationary distribution of population sizes in
the metastable state, which results in an exponential decrease of the mean time
to extinction. In the survival problem, bursty reproduction yields an
exponential increase in survival probability of the population. Close to the
bifurcation limit our analytical results simplify considerably and are shown to
depend solely on the mean and variance of the burst-size distribution. Our
formalism is demonstrated on several realistic distributions which all compare
well with numerical Monte-Carlo simulations.

1608.02229	q-bio	cs.NE cs.AI q-bio.NC	Towards the Self-constructive Brain: emergence of adaptive behavior	"  Adaptive behavior is mainly the result of adaptive brains. We go a step
beyond and claim that the brain does not only adapt to its surrounding reality
but rather, it builds itself up to constructs its own reality. That is, rather
than just trying to passively understand its environment, the brain is the
architect of its own reality in an active process where its internal models of
the external world frame how its new interactions with the environment are
assimilated. These internal models represent relevant predictive patterns of
interaction all over the different brain structures: perceptual, sensorimotor,
motor, etc. The emergence of adaptive behavior arises from this
self-constructive nature of the brain, based on the following principles of
organization: self-experimental, self- growing, and self-repairing.
Self-experimental, since to ensure survival, the self-constructive brain (SCB)
is an active machine capable of performing experiments of its own interactions
with the environment by mental simulation. Self-growing, since it dynamically
and incrementally constructs internal structures in order to build a model of
the world as it gathers statistics from its interactions with the environment.
Self-repairing, since to survive the SCB must also be robust and capable of
finding ways to repair parts of previously working structures and hence
re-construct a previous relevant pattern of activity.

  Optimization"	"  Developing automated and semi-automated solutions for reconstructing wiring
diagrams of the brain from electron micrographs is important for advancing the
field of connectomics. While the ultimate goal is to generate a graph of neuron
connectivity, most prior automated methods have focused on volume segmentation
rather than explicit graph estimation. In these approaches, one of the key,
commonly occurring error modes is dendritic shaft-spine fragmentation.
  We posit that directly addressing this problem of connection identification
may provide critical insight into estimating more accurate brain graphs. To
this end, we develop a network-centric approach motivated by biological priors
image grammars. We build a computer vision pipeline to reconnect fragmented
spines to their parent dendrites using both fully-automated and semi-automated
approaches. Our experiments show we can learn valid connections despite
uncertain segmentation paths. We curate the first known reference dataset for

  events are associated with pairs of inverted repeats"	"  Motivation: Genome rearrangement plays an important role in evolutionary
biology and has profound impacts on phenotype in organisms ranging from
microbes to humans. The mechanisms for genome rearrangement events remain
unclear. Lots of comparisons have been conducted among different species. To
reveal the mechanisms for rearrangement events, comparison of different
individuals/strains within the same species or genus (pan-genomes) is more
helpful since they are much closer to each other. Results: We study the
mechanism for inversion events via core-genome scaffold comparison of different
strains within the same species. We focus on two kinds of bacteria, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, and investigate the inversion events among
different strains of the same specie. We find an interesting phenomenon that
long (larger than 10,000 bp) inversion regions are flanked by a pair of
Inverted Repeats (IRs) (with lengths ranging from 385 bp to 27476 bp) which are
often Insertion Sequences (ISs).This mechanism can also explain why the
breakpoint reuses for inversion events happen. We study the prevalence of the
phenomenon and find that it is a major mechanism for inversions. The other
observation is that for different rearrangement events such as transposition
and inverted block interchange, the two ends of the swapped regions are also
associated with repeats so that after the rearrangement operations the two ends
of the swapped regions remain unchanged. To our knowledge, this is the first
time such a phenomenon is reported for transposition event.

are modelled using a chemical master equation formalism, from which the
evolution of the average number of cells of each telomere length is extracted.
In particular, the role of the telomere-elongating enzyme telomerase on these
dynamics is investigated. We show that for biologically relevant rates of cell
birth and death, one finds a critical rate, R_crit, of telomerase activity such
that the total number of cells diverges. Further, R_crit is similar in
magnitude to the rates of mitosis and cell death. The possible relationship of
this result to replicative immortality and its associated hallmark of cancer is
discussed.

  Languages Facilitate Building Complex and Flexible Bioinformatic Models"	"  We address the need for expanding the presence of the Lisp family of
programming languages in bioinformatics and computational biology research.
Languages of this family, like Common Lisp, Scheme, or Clojure, facilitate the
creation of powerful and flexible software models that are required for complex
and rapidly evolving domains like biology. We will point out several important
key features that distinguish languages of the Lisp family from other
programming languages and we will explain how these features can aid
researchers in becoming more productive and creating better code. We will also
show how these features make these languages ideal tools for artificial
intelligence and machine learning applications. We will specifically stress the
advantages of domain-specific languages (DSL): languages which are specialized
to a particular area and thus not only facilitate easier research problem
formulation, but also aid in the establishment of standards and best
programming practices as applied to the specific research field at hand. DSLs
are particularly easy to build in Common Lisp, the most comprehensive Lisp
dialect, which is commonly referred to as the ""programmable programming
language."" We are convinced that Lisp grants programmers unprecedented power to
build increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence systems that may
ultimately transform machine learning and AI research in bioinformatics and
computational biology.

post-transcriptionally. They are involved in key biological processes and then
may play a major role in the development of human diseases including cancer, in
particular their involvement in breast cancer metastasis has been confirmed.
Recently, the authors of ref.(\cite{key1} have found that miR-429 may have a
role in the inhibition of breast cancer metastasis and have identified its
target gene CRKL as a potential candidate. In this paper, by using systems
biology tools we have shown that CRKL is involved in positive regulation of
ERK1/2 signaling pathway and contribute to the regulation of LYN through a
topological generalization of feed forward loop.

  targeting overlapping sets of genes"	"  In contrary to the common belief that only one strand of the pre-miRNA is
active (usually the 5p one that is the more abundant) while the second one
(miRNA*) is discarded, functional 5p and 3p have been observed for many miRNAs.
Among those miRNAs is miR-34a which is a target gene of the tumor suppressor
p53. In this paper we have re-examined the role of miR-34a-5p and miR-34a-3p in
the signaling pathway of p53. We found that they target overlapping sets of
genes (MDM2 and THBS1). By a GO enrichment analysis we found that THBS1 is
involved in cancer and metastasis relevant processes. We have also deduce that
p53, MDM2 and miR-34a are linked by a type 1 incoherent FFL that represent a
novel mechanism for accelerating the response of p53 to external stress
signals.

  scaling properties of biopolymers"	"  Random heteropolymers are a minimal description of biopolymers and can
provide a theoretical framework to the investigate the formation of loops in
biophysical experiments. A two--state model provides a consistent and robust
way to study the scaling properties of loop formation in polymers of the size
of typical biological systems. Combining it with self--adjusting
simulated--tempering simulations, we can calculate numerically the looping
properties of several realizations of the random interactions within the chain.
Differently from homopolymers, random heteropolymers display at different
temperatures a continuous set of scaling exponents. The necessity of using
self--averaging quantities makes finite--size effects dominant at low
temperatures even for long polymers, shadowing the length--independent
character of looping probability expected in analogy with homopolymeric
globules. This could provide a simple explanation for the small scaling
exponents found in experiments, for example in chromosome folding.

F1-ATPase share a high degree of structural identity, though low primary
identity. Each subunit binds nucleotide in similar pockets, yet only $\beta$
subunits are catalytically active. Why? We re-examine their internal symmetry
axes and observe interesting differences. Dividing each chain into an
N-terminal head region, a C-terminal foot region, and a central torso, we
observe (1) that while the foot and head regions in all chains obtain high and
similar mobility, the torsos obtain different mobility profiles, with the
$\beta$ subunits exhibiting a higher motility compared to the $\alpha$
subunits, a trend supported by the crystallographic B-factors. The $\beta$
subunits have greater torso mobility by having fewer distributed, nonlocal
packing interactions providing a spacious and soft connectivity, and offsetting
the resultant softness with local stiffness elements, including an additional
$\beta$ sheet. (2) A loop near the nucleotide binding-domain of the $\beta$
subunits, absent in the $\alpha$ subunits, swings to create a large variation
in the occlusion of the nucleotide binding region. (3) A combination of the
softest three eigenmodes significantly reduces the RMSD between the open and
closed conformations of the $\beta$ subnits. (4) Comparisons of computed and
observed crystallographic B-factors suggest a suppression of a particular
symmetry axis in an $\alpha$ subunit. (5) Unexpectedly, the soft intra-monomer
oscillations pertain to distortions that do not create inter-monomer steric
clashes in the assembly, suggesting that structural optimization of the
assembly evolved at all levels of complexity.

1608.03047	q-bio	q-bio.MN cs.SY math.DS q-bio.SC	Computational Limitations of First-Order Repressor Systems	"  Almost all current approaches for engineering modular logic components in
synthetic biology use first-order regulators, including most CRISPR/CAS, TAL,
zinc finger, and RNA interference systems. Many practitioners understand
intuitively that second and higher order binding is necessary for scalability,
and this is easy to show for single-input single-output systems. However, no
study to date has analysed whether a more complex system, utilizing e.g.
feedback or error correction, can produce scalable computation from first-order
regulators. We prove here that first order repressor systems cannot support
bistability. In the process, we introduce a function G to measure signal
quality in molecular systems, and we show that G always decreases in dynamic
feedback systems as well as static feed-forward logic cascades of first-order
repressors. As a result, first order repressors cannot build memory or signal
buffering elements. Finally, we suggest G as a potential new property for
characterization of standard biological parts.

1608.03102	q-bio	stat.AP q-bio.PE	"Detecting non-binomial sex allocation when developmental mortality
  operates"	"  Optimal sex allocation theory is one of the most intricately developed areas
of evolutionary ecology. Under a range of conditions, particularly under
population sub-division, selection favours sex being allocated to offspring
non-randomly, generating non-binomial variances of offspring group sex ratios.
Detecting non-binomial sex allocation is complicated by stochastic
developmental mortality, as offspring sex can often only be identified on
maturity with the sex of non-maturing offspring remaining unknown. We show that
current approaches for detecting non-binomiality have limited ability to detect
non-binomial sex allocation when developmental mortality has occurred. We
present a new procedure using an explicit model of sex allocation and mortality
and develop a Bayesian model selection approach (available as an R package). We
use the double and multiplicative binomial distributions to model over- and
under-dispersed sex allocation and show how to calculate Bayes factors for
comparing these alternative models to the null hypothesis of binomial sex
allocation. The ability to detect non-binomial sex allocation is greatly
increased, particularly in cases where mortality is common. The use of Bayesian
methods allows for the quantification of the evidence in favour of each
hypothesis, and our modelling approach provides an improved descriptive
capability over existing approaches. We use a simulation study to demonstrate
substantial improvements in power for detecting non-binomial sex allocation in
situations where current methods fail, and we illustrate the approach in real
scenarios using empirically obtained datasets on the sexual composition of
groups of gregarious parasitoid wasps.

1608.03123	q-bio	cs.NE cs.CC q-bio.PE	"Escaping Local Optima using Crossover with Emergent or Reinforced
  Diversity"	"  Population diversity is essential for avoiding premature convergence in
Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and for the effective use of crossover. Yet the
dynamics of how diversity emerges in populations are not well understood. We
use rigorous runtime analysis to gain insight into population dynamics and GA
performance for the ($\mu$+1) GA and the $\text{Jump}_k$ test function. We show
that the interplay of crossover and mutation may serve as a catalyst leading to
a sudden burst of diversity. This leads to improvements of the expected
optimisation time of order $\Omega(n/\log n)$ compared to mutation-only
algorithms like (1+1) EA. Moreover, increasing the mutation rate by an
arbitrarily small constant factor can facilitate the generation of diversity,
leading to speedups of order $\Omega(n)$. We also compare seven commonly used
diversity mechanisms and evaluate their impact on runtime bounds for the
($\mu$+1) GA. All previous results in this context only hold for
unrealistically low crossover probability $p_c=O(k/n)$, while we give analyses
for the setting of constant $p_c < 1$ in all but one case.
  For the typical case of constant $k > 2$ and constant $p_c$, we can compare
the resulting expected runtimes for different diversity mechanisms assuming an
optimal choice of $\mu$: $O(n^{k-1})$ for duplicate elimination/minim.,
$O(n^2\log n)$ for maximising the convex hull, $O(n\log n)$ for deterministic
crowding (assuming $p_c = k/n$), $O(n\log n)$ for maximising Hamming distance,
$O(n\log n)$ for fitness sharing, $O(n\log n)$ for single-receiver island
model.
  This proves a sizeable advantage of all variants of the ($\mu$+1) GA compared
to (1+1) EA, which requires time $\Theta(n^k)$. Experiments complement our
theoretical findings and further highlight the benefits of crossover and
diversity on $\text{Jump}_k$.

  implies local activation of pC-collagen at individual fibrils"	"  Collagen fibril cross-sectional radii show no systematic variation between
the interior and the periphery of fibril bundles, indicating an effectively
constant rate of collagen incorporation into fibrils throughout the bundle.
Such spatially homogeneous incorporation constrains the extracellular diffusion
of collagen precursors from sources at the bundle boundary to sinks at the
growing fibrils. With a coarse-grained diffusion equation we determine
stringent bounds, using parameters extracted from published experimental
measurements of tendon development. From the lack of new fibril formation after
birth, we further require that the concentration of diffusing precursors stays
below the critical concentration for fibril nucleation. We find that the
combination of the diffusive bound, which requires larger concentrations to
ensure homogeneous fibril radii, and lack of nucleation, which requires lower
concentrations, is only marginally consistent with fully-processed collagen
using conservative bounds. More realistic bounds may leave no consistent
concentrations. Therefore, we propose that unprocessed pC-collagen diffuses
from the bundle periphery followed by local C-proteinase activity and
subsequent collagen incorporation at each fibril. We suggest that C-proteinase
is localized within bundles, at fibril surfaces, during radial fibrillar
growth. The much greater critical concentration of pC-collagen, as compared to
fully-processed collagen, then provides broad consistency between homogeneous
fibril radii and the lack of fibril nucleation during fibril growth.

  Fluctuating Enzymes"	"  Dynamic cooperativity in monomeric enzymes is characterized in terms of a
non-Michaelis-Menten kinetic behaviour. The latter is believed to be associated
with mechanisms that include multiple reaction pathways due to enzymatic
conformational fluctuations. Recent advances in single-molecule fluorescence
spectroscopy have provided new fundamental insights on the possible mechanisms
underlying reactions catalyzed by fluctuating enzymes. Here, we present a
bottom-up approach to understand enzyme turnover kinetics at physiologically
relevant mesoscopic concentrations informed by mechanisms extracted from
single-molecule stochastic trajectories. The stochastic approach, presented
here, shows the emergence of dynamic cooperativity in terms of a slowing down
of the Michaelis-Menten (MM) kinetics resulting in negative cooperativity. For
fewer enzymes, dynamic cooperativity emerges due to the combined effects of
enzymatic conformational fluctuations and molecular discreteness. The increase
in the number of enzymes, however, suppresses the effect of enzymatic
conformational fluctuations such that dynamic cooperativity emerges solely due
to the discrete changes in the number of reacting species. These results
confirm that the turnover kinetics of fluctuating enzyme based on the
parallel-pathway MM mechanism switches over to the single-pathway MM mechanism
with the increase in the number of enzymes. For large enzyme numbers,
convergence to the exact MM equation occurs in the limit of very high substrate
concentration as the stochastic kinetics approaches the deterministic
behaviour.

1608.03461	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Black-boxing and cause-effect power	"  Reductionism assumes that causation in the physical world occurs at the micro
level, excluding the emergence of macro-level causation. We challenge this
reductionist assumption by demonstrating that, once causal power is properly
defined and measured, it is possible for a macro level to 'beat' the micro
level. Here, this was done through a principled, well-defined measure of
intrinsic cause-effect power - integrated information ({\Phi}). Simple systems
were evaluated for {\Phi} across different spatial and temporal scales by
systematically considering all possible black boxes. These are macro elements
that consist of one or more micro elements over one or more micro time steps.
Cause-effect power was evaluated based on the inputs and outputs of the black
boxes, ignoring the internal mechanisms that support their function. We show
that a macro, black-box system can have higher {\Phi} than its micro
constituents either by implementing more selective mechanisms (lower
degeneracy) or by composing a system having more common inputs and outputs
(higher integration). We also show that, for a given micro system, one can
identify local maxima of {\Phi} across several spatiotemporal scales. These
local maxima correspond to macro levels of organization at which causal
features of physical systems emerge, and provide a natural focus for scientific
inquiries.

  Real-time Brain-Computer Interfaces"	"  $Objective$: A characteristic of neurological signal processing is high
levels of noise from sub-cellular ion channels up to whole-brain processes. In
this paper, we propose a new model of electroencephalogram (EEG) background
periodograms, based on a family of functions which we call generalized van der
Ziel--McWhorter (GVZM) power spectral densities (PSDs). To the best of our
knowledge, the GVZM PSD function is the only EEG noise model which has
relatively few parameters, matches recorded EEG PSD's with high accuracy from 0
Hz to over 30 Hz, and has approximately $1/f^\theta$ behavior in the
mid-frequencies without infinities. $Methods$: We validate this model using
three approaches. First, we show how GVZM PSDs can arise in population of ion
channels in maximum entropy equilibrium. Second, we present a class of mixed
autoregressive models, which simulate brain background noise and whose
periodograms are asymptotic to the GVZM PSD. Third, we present two real-time
estimation algorithms for steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)
frequencies, and analyze their performance statistically. $Results$: In
pairwise comparisons, the GVZM-based algorithms showed statistically
significant accuracy improvement over two well-known and widely-used SSVEP
estimators. $Conclusion$: The GVZM noise model can be a useful and reliable
technique for EEG signal processing. $Significance$: Understanding EEG noise is
essential for EEG-based neurology and applications such as real-time
brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which must make accurate control decisions
from very short data epochs. The GVZM approach represents a successful new
paradigm for understanding and managing this neurological noise.

  of neuronal avalanches"	"  Neuronal avalanches measured in vitro and in vivo in different cortical
networks consistently exhibit power law behaviour for the size and duration
distributions with exponents typical for a mean field self-organized branching
process. These exponents are also recovered in neuronal network simulations
implementing various neuronal dynamics on different network topologies. They
can therefore be considered a very robust feature of spontaneous neuronal
activity. Interestingly, this scaling behaviour is also observed on regular
lattices in finite dimensions, which raises the question about the origin of
the mean field behaviour observed experimentally. In this study we provide an
answer to this open question by investigating the effect of activity dependent
plasticity in combination with the neuronal refractory time in a neuronal
network. Results show that the refractory time hinders backward avalanches
forcing a directed propagation. Hebbian plastic adaptation plays the role of
sculpting these directed avalanche patterns into the topology of the network
slowly changing it into a branched structure where loops are marginal.

1608.03471	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Demographic noise can reverse the direction of deterministic selection	"  Deterministic evolutionary theory robustly predicts that populations
displaying altruistic behaviours will be driven to extinction by mutant cheats
that absorb common benefits but do not themselves contribute. Here we show that
when demographic stochasticity is accounted for, selection can in fact act in
the reverse direction to that predicted deterministically, instead favouring
cooperative behaviors that appreciably increase the carrying capacity of the
population. Populations that exist in larger numbers experience a selective
advantage by being more stochastically robust to invasions than smaller
populations, and this advantage can persist even in the presence of
reproductive costs. We investigate this general effect in the specific context
of public goods production and find conditions for stochastic selection
reversal leading to the success of public good producers. This insight,
developed here analytically, is missed by both the deterministic analysis as
well as standard game theoretic models that enforce a fixed population size.
The effect is found to be amplified by space; in this scenario we find that
selection reversal occurs within biologically reasonable parameter regimes for
microbial populations. Beyond the public good problem, we formulate a general
mathematical framework for models that may exhibit stochastic selection
reversal. In this context, we describe a stochastic analogue to r-K theory, by
which small populations can evolve to higher densities in the absence of
disturbance.

stimulus intensities. How this tuning is achieved is poorly understood in most
receptors. We show that in the C. elegans URX O2 sensing neurons two putative
molecular O2 sensors, a neuroglobin and O2-binding soluble guanylate cyclases,
work antagonistically to sculpt a slowly sigmoidal O2 response curve tuned to
approach saturation when O2 reaches 21%. glb-5 imposes this sigmoidal function
by inhibiting O2-evoked Ca2+ responses in URX when O2 levels fall. Without
GLB-5, the URX response curve approaches saturation at 15% O2. Behaviorally,
GLB-5 signaling broadens the O2 preference of C. elegans while maintaining
strong avoidance of 21% O2. Our computational aerotaxis model suggests that the
relationship between GLB-5-modulated URX responses and reversal behavior is
sufficient to broaden O2-preference. Thus, a neuroglobin can shift neural
information coding leading to a change in perception and altered behavior.

1608.03520	q-bio	q-bio.NC math.AT math.CO	Cliques and Cavities in the Human Connectome	"  Encoding brain regions and their connections as a network of nodes and edges
captures many of the possible paths along which information can be transmitted
as humans process and perform complex behaviors. Because cognitive processes
involve large and distributed networks of brain areas, examinations of
multi-node routes within larger connection patterns can offer fundamental
insights into the complexities of brain function. Here, we investigate both
densely connected groups of nodes that could perform local computations as well
as larger patterns of interactions that would allow for parallel processing.
Finding such structures necessitates we move from considering pairwise
interactions to capturing higher order relations, concepts naturally expressed
in the language of algebraic topology. These tools can be used to study
mesoscale structures arising from the arrangement of densely connected
substructures called cliques in otherwise sparsely connected brain networks. We
detect cliques (all-to-all connected sets of brain regions) in the average
structural connectomes of 8 healthy adults and discover the presence of more
large cliques than expected in null networks constructed via wiring
minimization, providing architecture through which brain network can perform
rapid, local processing. We then locate topological cavities of different
dimensions, around which information may flow in either diverging or converging
patterns. These cavities exist consistently across subjects, differ from those
observed in null model networks, and link regions of early and late
evolutionary origin in long loops, underscoring their unique role in
controlling brain function. These results offer a first demonstration that
techniques from algebraic topology offer a novel perspective on structural
connectomics, highlighting loop-like paths as crucial features in the human
brain's structural architecture.

  Learning Algorithms"	"  Use of computational methods to predict gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from
gene expression data is a challenging task. Many studies have been conducted
using unsupervised methods to fulfill the task; however, such methods usually
yield low prediction accuracies due to the lack of training data. In this
article, we propose semi-supervised methods for GRN prediction by utilizing two
machine learning algorithms, namely support vector machines (SVM) and random
forests (RF). The semi-supervised methods make use of unlabeled data for
training. We investigate inductive and transductive learning approaches, both
of which adopt an iterative procedure to obtain reliable negative training data
from the unlabeled data. We then apply our semi-supervised methods to gene
expression data of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and evaluate
the performance of our methods using the expression data. Our analysis
indicated that the transductive learning approach outperformed the inductive
learning approach for both organisms. However, there was no conclusive
difference identified in the performance of SVM and RF. Experimental results
also showed that the proposed semi-supervised methods performed better than
existing supervised methods for both organisms.

  extinctions"	"  Community ecology has traditionally relied on the competitive exclusion
principle, a piece of common wisdom in conceptual frameworks developed to
describe species assemblages. Key concepts in community ecology, such as
limiting similarity and niche partitioning, are based on competitive exclusion.
However, this classical paradigm in ecology relies on implications derived from
simple, deterministic models. Here we show how the predictions of a symmetric,
deterministic model about the way extinctions proceed can be utterly different
from the results derived from the same model when ecological drift (demographic
stochasticity) is explicitly considered. Using analytical approximations to the
steady-state conditional probabilities for assemblages with two and three
species, we demonstrate that stochastic competitive exclusion leads to a
cascade of extinctions, whereas the symmetric, deterministic model predicts a
multiple collapse of species. To test the robustness of our results, we have
studied the effect of environmental stochasticity and relaxed the species
symmetry assumption. Our conclusions highlight the crucial role of
stochasticity when deriving reliable theoretical predictions for species
community assembly.

functional connectivity, there has been a proliferation of confound regression
methods to limit its impact. However, recent techniques have not been
systematically evaluated using consistent outcome measures. Here, we provide a
systematic evaluation of 12 commonly used confound regression methods in 193
young adults. Specifically, we compare methods according to three benchmarks,
including the residual relationship between motion and connectivity,
distance-dependent effects of motion on connectivity, and additional degrees of
freedom lost in confound regression. Our results delineate two clear trade-offs
among methods. First, methods that include global signal regression minimize
the relationship between connectivity and motion, but unmask distance-dependent
artifact. In contrast, censoring methods mitigate both motion artifact and
distance-dependence, but use additional degrees of freedom. Taken together,
these results emphasize the heterogeneous efficacy of proposed methods, and
suggest that different confound regression strategies may be appropriate in the
context of specific scientific goals.

whether structural brain networks are similarly refined during development,
potentially allowing for improvements in executive function. In a sample of 882
participants (ages 8-22) who underwent diffusion imaging as part of the
Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, we demonstrate that structural network
modules become more segregated with age, with weaker connections between
modules and stronger connections within modules. Evolving modular topology
facilitated network integration, driven by age-related strengthening of hub
edges that were present both within and between modules. Critically, both
modular segregation and network integration were associated with enhanced
executive performance, and mediated the improvement of executive functioning
with age. Together, results delineate a process of structural network
maturation that supports executive function in youth.

Here, we focus on two experimentally well-identified gliotransmitter patwhays:
(i)~modulations of synaptic release and (ii)~postynaptic slow inward currents
mediated by glutamate released from astrocytes, and investigate their possible
functional relevance on synaptic plasticity in a biophysical model of an
astrocyte-regulated synapse. Our model predicts that both pathways could
profoundly affect both short- and long-term plasticity. In particular,
activity-dependent glutamate release from astrocytes, could dramatically change
spike-timing--dependent plasticity, turning potentiation into depression (and
vice versa) for the same protocol.

1608.03672	q-bio	cs.AI q-bio.GN	"Inferring unknown biological function by integration of GO annotations
  and gene expression data"	"  Characterizing genes with semantic information is an important process
regarding the description of gene products. In spite that complete genomes of
many organisms have been already sequenced, the biological functions of all of
their genes are still unknown. Since experimentally studying the functions of
those genes, one by one, would be unfeasible, new computational methods for
gene functions inference are needed. We present here a novel computational
approach for inferring biological function for a set of genes with previously
unknown function, given a set of genes with well-known information. This
approach is based on the premise that genes with similar behaviour should be
grouped together. This is known as the guilt-by-association principle. Thus, it
is possible to take advantage of clustering techniques to obtain groups of
unknown genes that are co-clustered with genes that have well-known semantic
information (GO annotations). Meaningful knowledge to infer unknown semantic
information can therefore be provided by these well-known genes. We provide a
method to explore the potential function of new genes according to those
currently annotated. The results obtained indicate that the proposed approach
could be a useful and effective tool when used by biologists to guide the
inference of biological functions for recently discovered genes. Our work sets
an important landmark in the field of identifying unknown gene functions
through clustering, using an external source of biological input. A simple web
interface to this proposal can be found at

  discontinuous versus continuous phase transition"	"  Unsupervised neural network learning extracts hidden features from unlabeled
training data. This is used as a pretraining step for further supervised
learning in deep networks. Hence, understanding unsupervised learning is of
fundamental importance. Here, we study the unsupervised learning from a finite
number of data, based on the restricted Boltzmann machine learning. Our study
inspires an efficient message passing algorithm to infer the hidden feature,
and estimate the entropy of candidate features consistent with the data. Our
analysis reveals that the learning requires only a few data if the feature is
salient and extensively many if the feature is weak. Moreover, the entropy of
candidate features monotonically decreases with data size and becomes negative
(i.e., entropy crisis) before the message passing becomes unstable, suggesting
a discontinuous phase transition. In terms of convergence time of the message
passing algorithm, the unsupervised learning exhibits an easy-hard-easy
phenomenon as the training data size increases. All these properties are
reproduced in an approximate Hopfield model, with an exception that the entropy
crisis is absent, and only continuous phase transition is observed. This key
difference is also confirmed in a handwritten digits dataset. This study
deepens our understanding of unsupervised learning from a finite number of
data, and may provide insights into its role in training deep networks.

at the single nucleotide level which retains the characteristic helical
structure, while being able to simulate large molecules -- up to a million base
pairs -- for time-scales which are relevant to physiological processes. This is
made possible by an efficient and highly-parallelised implementation of the
model which we discuss here. We compare the behaviour of our model with single

We also present some results on the kinetics of denaturation of linear DNA.

system, we discuss in detail a model of HVC$_{\text{RA}}$ projection neurons
comprised of a somatic compartment with fast Na$^+$ and K$^+$ currents and a
dendritic compartment with slower Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics. We show this model
qualitatively exhibits many observed electrophysiological behaviors. We then
show in numerical procedures how one can design and analyze feasible laboratory
experiments that allow the estimation of all of the many parameters and
unmeasured dynamical variables, given observations of the somatic voltage
$V_s(t)$ alone. A key to this procedure is to initially estimate the slow
dynamics associated with Ca, blocking the fast Na and K variations, and then
with the Ca parameters fixed, estimate the fast Na and K dynamics. This
separation of time scales provides a numerically robust method for completing
the full neuron model, and the efficacy of the method is tested by prediction
when observations are complete. The simulation provides a framework for the
slice preparation experiments and illustrates the use of data assimilation
methods for the design of those experiments.

  complex networks"	"  Studies on how to model the interplay between diseases and behavioral
responses (so-called coupled disease-behavior interaction) have attracted
increasing attention. Owing to the lack of obvious clinical evidence of
diseases, or the incomplete information related to the disease, the risks of
infection cannot be perceived and may lead to inappropriate behavioral
responses. Therefore, how to quantitatively analyze the impacts of asymptomatic
infection on the interplay between diseases and behavioral responses is of
particular importance. In this Letter, under the complex network framework, we
study the coupled disease-behavior interaction model by dividing infectious
individuals into two states: U-state (without evident clinical symptoms,
labelled as U) and I-state (with evident clinical symptoms, labelled as I). A
susceptible individual can be infected by U- or I-nodes, however, since the
U-nodes cannot be easily observed, susceptible individuals take behavioral
responses \emph{only} when they contact I-nodes. The mechanism is considered in
the improved Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model and the improved
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, respectively. Then, one of the most
concerned problems in spreading dynamics: the epidemic thresholds for the two
models are given by two methods. The analytic results \emph{quantitatively}
describe the influence of different factors, such as asymptomatic infection,
the awareness rate, the network structure, and so forth, on the epidemic
thresholds. Moreover, because of the irreversible process of the SIR model, the
suppression effect of the improved SIR model is weaker than the improved SIS
model.

reconstruction artifacts in high-resolution micro-CT and C-arm systems. However
these methods cannot be directly used in the all-important domain of clinical
CT. This is because when the CT scan is truncated, the scout views are also
truncated. However many cases of truncation in clinical CT involve partial
truncation, where the anterio-posterior (AP) scout is truncated, but the
medio-lateral (ML) scout is non-truncated. In this paper, we show that in such
cases of partially truncated CT scans, a modified configuration may be used to
acquire non-truncated AP scout view, and ultimately allow for highly accurate
interior reconstruction.

agents are coded by binary strings standing for strategies for action,
blueprints for products or attitudes and beliefs. The model is patterned on an
established model of biological evolution, the Tangled Nature Model (TNM),
where a `tangle' of interactions between agents determines their reproductive
success. In addition, our agents also have the ability to copy part of each
other's strategy, a feature inspired by the Axelrod model of cultural
diversity. Unlike the latter, but similarly to the TNM, the model dynamics goes
through a series of metastable stages of increasing length, each characterized
by mutually enforcing cultural patterns. These patterns are abruptly replaced
by other patterns characteristic of the next metastable period. We analyze the
time dependence of the population and diversity in the system, show how
different cultures are formed and merge, and how their survival probability
lacks, in the model, a finite average life-time. Finally, we use historical
data on the number of car manufacturers after the introduction of the
automobile to the market, to argue that ourmodel can qualitatively reproduce
the flurry of cultural activity which follows a disruptive innovation.

  metastatic breast cancer studies: meta-analyses of published studies"	"  Purpose: PFS is often used as a surrogate endpoint for OS in metastatic
breast cancer studies. We have evaluated the association of treatment effect on
PFS with significant HR$_{OS}$ (and how this association is affected by other
factors) in published prospective metastatic breast cancer studies.
  Methods: A systematic literature search in PubMed identified prospective
metastatic breast cancer studies. Treatments effects on PFS were determined
using hazard ratio (HR$_{PFS}$), increase in median PFS ($\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$)
and % increase in median PFS (%$\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$). Diagnostic accuracy of PFS
measures (HR$_{PFS}$, $\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$ and %$\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$) in
predicting significant HR$_{OS}$ was assessed using receiver operating
characteristics (ROC) curves and classification trees approach.
  Results: Seventy-three cases (i.e., treatment to control comparisons) from 64
individual publications were identified for the analyses. Of these, 16 cases
reported significant treatment effect on HR$_{OS}$ at 5% level of significance.
Median number of deaths reported in these cases were 156. Area under the ROC
curve (AUC) for diagnostic measures as HR$_{PFS}$, $\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$ and
%$\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$ were 0.69, 0.70 and 0.75, respectively. Classification
tree results identified %$\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$ and number of deaths as diagnostic
measure for significant HR$_{OS}$. Only 7.9\% (3/39) cases with
$\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$ shorter than 48.27\% reported significant HR$_{OS}$. There
were 7 cases with $\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$ of 48.27\% or more and number of deaths
reported as 227 or more -- of these 5 cases reported significant HR$_{OS}$.
  Conclusion: %$\Delta$MED$_{PFS}$ was found as better diagnostic measure for
significant HR$_{OS}$. Our analysis results also suggest that consideration of
total number of deaths may further improve its diagnostic performance.

semi-definite. It is shown that the condition
$\int^{\infty}\lambda_{1}(P(t))~dt=\infty$, where $\lambda_{1}(P(t))$ is the
smallest eigenvalue of $P(t)$, plays a key role in guaranteeing uniform
asymptotic stability and in providing information on the basis of attraction of

simple genetic circuit consisting of multiple copies of an self-regulating
gene. We analyse how the variation in gene copy number and the mutations
changing the auto-regulation strength affect the steady-state distribution of
protein concentration.
  We predict that one-reporter assay, an experimental method where the
extrinsic noise level is inferred from the comparison of expression variance of
a single and duplicated reporter gene, may give an incorrect estimation of the
extrinsic noise contribution when applied to self-regulating genes.
  We also show that an imperfect duplication of an auto-activated gene,
changing the regulation strength of one of the copies, may lead to a hybrid,
binary+graded response of these genes to external signal.
  The analysis of relative changes in mean gene expression before and after
duplication suggests that evolutionary accumulation of gene duplications may
non-trivially depend on the inherent noisiness of a given gene, quantified by
maximal mean frequency of bursts.
  Moreover, we find that the dependence of gene expression noise on gene copy
number and auto-regulation strength may qualitatively differ, e.g. in
monotonicity, depending on whether the noise is measured by Fano factor or
coefficient of variation. Thus, experimentally-based hypotheses linking gene
expression noise and evolutionary optimisation may be ambiguous as they are
dependent on the particular function chosen to quantify noise.

  computer-based set-up"	"  Movement coordination in human ensembles has been studied little in the
current literature. In the existing experimental works, situations where all
subjects are connected with each other through direct visual and auditory
coupling, and social interaction affects their coordination, have been
investigated. Here, we study coordination in human ensembles via a novel
computer-based set-up that enables individuals to coordinate each other's
motion from a distance so as to minimize the influence of social interaction.
The proposed platform makes it possible to implement different visual
interaction patterns among the players, so that participants take into
consideration the motion of a designated subset of the others. This allows the
evaluation of the exclusive effects on coordination of the structure of
interconnections among the players and their own dynamics. Our set-up enables
also the deployment of virtual players to investigate dyadic interaction
between a human and a virtual agent, as well as group synchronization in mixed
teams of human and virtual agents. We use this novel set-up to study
coordination both in dyads and in groups over different structures of
interconnections, with and without virtual agents. We find that, in dual
interaction, virtual players manage to interact with participants in a
human-like fashion, thus confirming findings in previous work. We also observe
that, in group interaction, the level of coordination among humans in the
absence of direct visual and auditory coupling depends on the structure of
interconnections among participants. This confirms, as recently suggested in
the literature, that different coordination levels are achieved over diverse
visual pairings in the presence and in the absence of social interaction. We
present preliminary experimental results on the effect on group coordination of
deploying virtual computer agents in the human ensemble.

1608.04824	q-bio	physics.bio-ph math.PR nlin.AO q-bio.QM	Noise and Function	"  Noise is widely understood to be something that interferes with a signal or
process. Thus, it is generally thought to be destructive, obscuring signals and
interfering with function. However, early in the 20th century, mechanical
engineers found that mechanisms inducing additional vibration in mechanical
systems could prevent sticking and hysteresis. This so-called ""dither"" noise
was later introduced in an entirely different context at the advent of digital
information transmission and recording in the early 1960s. Ironically, the
addition of noise allows one to preserve information that would otherwise be
lost when the signal or image is digitized. As we shall see, the benefits of
added noise in these contexts are closely related to the phenomenon which has
come to be known as stochastic resonance, the original version of which
appealed to noise to explain how small periodic fluctuations in the
eccentricity of the earth's orbit might be amplified in such a way as to bring
about the observed periodic transitions in climate from ice age to temperate
age and back. These noise-induced transitions have since been invoked to
explain a wide array of biological phenomena, including the foraging and
tracking behavior of ants. Many biological phenomena, from foraging to gene
expression, are noisy, involving an element of randomness. In this paper, we
illustrate the general principles behind dithering and stochastic resonance
using examples from image processing, and then show how the constructive use of
noise can carry over to systems found in nature.

of a docking program and learns how to extract relevant features from basic
data such as atom and residues types obtained from protein-ligand complexes.
Our approach introduces the use of atom and amino acid embeddings and
implements an effective way of creating distributed vector representations of
protein-ligand complexes by modeling the compound as a set of atom contexts
that is further processed by a convolutional layer. One of the main advantages
of the proposed method is that it does not require feature engineering. We
evaluate DeepVS on the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD), using the output of
two docking programs: AutodockVina1.1.2 and Dock6.6. Using a strict evaluation
with leave-one-out cross-validation, DeepVS outperforms the docking programs in
both AUC ROC and enrichment factor. Moreover, using the output of
AutodockVina1.1.2, DeepVS achieves an AUC ROC of 0.81, which, to the best of
our knowledge, is the best AUC reported so far for virtual screening using the

1608.04935	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Identification of interictal epileptic networks from dense-EEG	"  Epilepsy is a network disease. The epileptic network usually involves
spatially distributed brain regions. In this context, noninvasive M/EEG source
connectivity is an emerging technique to identify functional brain networks at
cortical level from noninvasive recordings. In this paper, we analyze the
effect of the two key factors involved in EEG source connectivity processing:
i) the algorithm used in the solution of the EEG inverse problem and ii) the
method used in the estimation of the functional connectivity. We evaluate four
inverse solutions algorithms and four connectivity measures on data simulated
from a combined biophysical/physiological model to generate realistic
interictal epileptic spikes reflected in scalp EEG. We use a new network-based
similarity index (SI) to compare between the network identified by each of the
inverse/connectivity combination and the original network generated in the
model. The method will be also applied on real data recorded from one epileptic
patient who underwent a full presurgical evaluation for drug-resistant focal
epilepsy. In simulated data, results revealed that the selection of the
inverse/connectivity combination has a significant impact on the identified
networks. Results suggested that nonlinear methods for measuring the
connectivity are more efficient than the linear one. The wMNE inverse solution
showed higher performance than dSPM, cMEM and sLORETA. In real data, the
combination (wMNE/PLV) led to a very good matching between the interictal
epileptic network identified from noninvasive EEG recordings and the network
obtained from connectivity analysis of intracerebral EEG recordings. These
results suggest that source connectivity method, when appropriately configured,
is able to extract highly relevant diagnostic information about networks
involved in interictal epileptic spikes from non-invasive dense-EEG data.

  Excitation Sources and Electric Potentials Produced by Deep Brain Stimulation"	"  Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical treatment for Parkinson's Disease.
Static models based on quasi-static approximation are common approaches for DBS
modeling. While this simplification has been validated for bioelectric sources,
its application to rapid stimulation pulses, which contain more high-frequency
power, may not be appropriate, as DBS therapeutic results depend on stimulus
parameters such as frequency and pulse width, which are related to time
variations of the electric field. We propose an alternative hybrid approach
based on probabilistic models and differential equations, by using Gaussian
processes and wave equation. Our model avoids quasi-static approximation,
moreover, it is able to describe dynamic behavior of DBS. Therefore, the
proposed model may be used to obtain a more realistic phenomenon description.
The proposed model can also solve inverse problems, i.e. to recover the
corresponding source of excitation, given electric potential distribution. The
electric potential produced by a time-varying source was predicted using
proposed model. For static sources, the electric potential produced by
different electrode configurations were modeled. Four different sources of
excitation were recovered by solving the inverse problem. We compare our
outcomes with the electric potential obtained by solving Poisson's equation
using the Finite Element Method (FEM). Our approach is able to take into
account time variations of the source and the produced field. Also, inverse
problem can be addressed using the proposed model. The electric potential
calculated with the proposed model is close to the potential obtained by
solving Poisson's equation using FEM.

complex nonlinear systems and their sustainability. In particular, Fisher
Information (FI) has been evoked as a useful measure of sustainability and the
variability of dynamical systems including self-organising systems. By
utilising FI, we investigate the sustainability of the logistic model for
different perturbations in the positive and/or negative feedback. Specifically,
we consider different oscillatory modulations in the parameters for positive
and negative feedbacks and investigate their effect on the evolution of the
system and Probability Density Functions (PDFs). Depending on the relative time
scale of the perturbation to the response time of the system (the linear growth
rate), we demonstrate the maintenance of the initial condition for a long time,
manifested by a broad bimodal PDF. We present the analysis of FI in different
cases and elucidate its implications for the sustainability of population
dynamics. We also show that a purely oscillatory growth rate can lead to a
finite amplitude solution while self-organisation of these systems can break
down with an exponentially growing solution due to the fluctuation in negative
feedback.

significance. On top of preserving biodiversity, these interspecific and
intraspecific symbioses provide useful examples of interindividual associations
thought to underly transitions in organic evolution. Being interindividual in
nature, such processes may involve emergent phenomena and hence call for
analytical solutions provided by computing tools and modelling, as opposed to
classical biological methods of analysis. Here we provide selected examples of
such solutions, showing that termite studies may profit from a symbiotic-like
link with computing science to open up wide and new research avenues in ecology

1608.05494	q-bio	q-bio.MN q-bio.GN q-bio.PE	Associative memory by collective regulation of non-coding RNA	"  The majority of mammalian genomic transcripts do not directly code for
proteins and it is currently believed that most of these are not under
evolutionary constraint. However given the abundance non-coding RNA (ncRNA) and
its strong affinity for inter-RNA binding, these molecules have the potential
to regulate proteins in a highly distributed way, similar to artificial neural
networks. We explore this analogy by devising a simple architecture for a
biochemical network that can function as an associative memory. We show that
the steady state solution for this chemical network has the same structure as
an associative memory neural network model. By allowing the choice of
equilibrium constants between different ncRNA species, the concentration of
unbound ncRNA can be made to follow any pattern and many patterns can be stored
simultaneously. The model is studied numerically and within certain parameter
regimes it functions as predicted. Even if the starting concentration pattern
is quite different, it is shown to converge to the original pattern most of the
time. The network is also robust to mutations in equilibrium constants. This
calls into question the criteria for deciding if a sequence is under
evolutionary constraint.

  and their Interaction Graph"	"  In this paper, we address the formal characterization of targets triggering
cellular trans-differentiation in the scope of Boolean networks with
asynchronous dynamics. Given two fixed points of a Boolean network, we are
interested in all the combinations of mutations which allow to switch from one
fixed point to the other, either possibly, or inevitably. In the case of
existential reachability, we prove that the set of nodes to (permanently) flip
are only and necessarily in certain connected components of the interaction
graph. In the case of inevitable reachability, we provide an algorithm to
identify a subset of possible solutions.

1608.05553	q-bio	nlin.PS q-bio.PE	"Rock-paper-scissors played within competing domains in predator-prey
  games"	"  We consider (N,r) games of predation with N species and r < N prey and
predators, acting in a cyclic way. Further basic reactions include
reproduction, decay and diffusion over a regular grid, without a hard
constraint on the occupation number per site, so in a ""bosonic"" implementation.
For special combinations of N and r and appropriate parameter choices we
observe games within games, that is, different coexisting games, depending on
the spatial resolution. As concrete and simplest example we analyze the (6,3)
game. Once the players segregate from a random initial distribution, domains
emerge, which effectively play a (2,1)-game on the coarse scale of domain
diameters, while agents inside the domains play (3,1) (rock-paper-scissors),
leading to spiral formation with species chasing each other. As the (2,1)-game
has a winner in the end, the coexistence of domains is transient, while agents
inside the remaining domain coexist, until demographic fluctuations lead to
extinction of all but one species in the very end. This means that we observe a
dynamical generation of multiple space and time scales with emerging
re-organization of players upon segregation, starting from a simple set of
rules on the smallest scale and changed rules from the coarser perspective.
These observations are based on Gillespie simulations. We discuss the
deterministic limit derived from a van Kampen expansion. The linear stability
analysis predicts the number of forming domains, their composition in terms of
species; it also explains the instability of interfaces between domains, which
drives their extinction; spiral patterns are identified as motion along
heteroclinic cycles. The numerical solutions reproduce the observed patterns of
the Gillespie simulations including even extinction events, so that the
mean-field analysis here is very conclusive, which is due to the specific
implementation of rules.

quantitatively defined, by a combination of high clustering and short path
length; and about 10 years since this metric of complex network topology began
to be widely applied to analysis of neuroimaging and other neuroscience data as
part of the rapid growth of the new field of connectomics. Here we review
briefly the foundational concepts of graph theoretical estimation and
generation of small-world networks. We take stock of some of the key
developments in the field in the past decade and we consider in some detail the
implications of recent studies using high-resolution tract-tracing methods to
map the anatomical networks of the macaque and the mouse. In doing so, we draw
attention to the important methodological distinction between topological
analysis of binary or unweighted graphs, which have provided a popular but
simple approach to brain network analysis in the past, and the topology of
weighted graphs, which retain more biologically relevant information and are
more appropriate to the increasingly sophisticated data on brain connectivity
emerging from contemporary tract-tracing and other imaging studies. We conclude
by highlighting some possible future trends in the further development of
weighted small-worldness as part of a deeper and broader understanding of the
topology and the functional value of the strong and weak links between areas of
mammalian cortex.

communicate with intelligent beings that have evolved on other planets, yet we
are intelligent and curious enough to wonder about this. We find ourselves
wondering about this at the very beginning of a long era in which stellar
luminosity warms many planets, and by our best models, continues to provide
equally good opportunities for intelligent life to evolve. By simple Bayesian
reasoning, if, as we believe, intelligent life forms have the same propensity
to evolve later on other planets as we had to evolve on ours, it follows that
they will likely not pass through a similar wondering stage in their evolution.
This suggests that the future holds some kind of interstellar communication
that will serve to inform newly evolved intelligent life forms that they are
not alone before they become curious.

  marker for traumatic brain injuries and neurodegenerative diseases"	"  The presence of diffuse Focal Axonal Swellings (FAS) is a hallmark cellular
feature in many neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic brain injury. Among
other things, the FAS have a significant impact on spike-train encodings that
propagate through the affected neurons, leading to compromised signal
processing on a neuronal network level. This work merges, for the first time,
three fields of study: (i) signal processing in excitatory-inhibitory (EI)
networks of neurons via population codes, (ii) decision-making theory driven by
the production of evidence from stimulus, and (iii) compromised spike-train
propagation through FAS. As such, we demonstrate a mathematical architecture
capable of characterizing compromised decision-making driven by cellular
mechanisms. The computational model also leads to several novel predictions and
diagnostics for understanding injury level and cognitive deficits, including a
key finding that decision-making reaction times, rather than accuracy, are
indicative of network level damage. The results have a number of translational
implications, including that the level of network damage can be characterized
by the reaction times in simple cognitive and motor tests.

that the CM model is a truly chaotic one, as defined by Devaney. Then, we show
that mutations occurring in gene mutations have the same chaotic dynamic, thus
making the use of chaotic models relevant for genome evolution.

1608.05855	q-bio	q-bio.BM math.DS	"Protein Folding in the 2D Hydrophobic-Hydrophilic (HP) Square Lattice
  Model is Chaotic"	"  Among the unsolved problems in computational biology, protein folding is one
of the most interesting challenges. To study this folding, tools like neural
networks and genetic algorithms have received a lot of attention, mainly due to
the NP-completeness of the folding process. The background idea that has given
rise to the use of these algorithms is obviously that the folding process is
predictable. However, this important assumption is disputable as chaotic
properties of such a process have been recently highlighted. In this paper,
which is an extension of a former work accepted to the 2011 International Joint
Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN11), the topological behavior of a
well-known dynamical system used for protein folding prediction is evaluated.
It is mathematically established that the folding dynamics in the 2D
hydrophobic-hydrophilic (HP) square lattice model, simply called ""the 2D model""
in this document, is indeed a chaotic dynamical system as defined by Devaney.
Furthermore, the chaotic behavior of this model is qualitatively and
quantitatively deepened, by studying other mathematical properties of disorder,
namely: the indecomposability, instability, strong transitivity, and constants
of expansivity and sensitivity. Some consequences for both biological paradigms
and structure prediction using this model are then discussed. In particular, it
is shown that some neural networks seems to be unable to predict the evolution
of this model with accuracy, due to its complex behavior.

1608.05949	q-bio	cs.LG q-bio.QM	Distributed Representations for Biological Sequence Analysis	"  Biological sequence comparison is a key step in inferring the relatedness of
various organisms and the functional similarity of their components. Thanks to
the Next Generation Sequencing efforts, an abundance of sequence data is now
available to be processed for a range of bioinformatics applications. Embedding
a biological sequence over a nucleotide or amino acid alphabet in a lower
dimensional vector space makes the data more amenable for use by current
machine learning tools, provided the quality of embedding is high and it
captures the most meaningful information of the original sequences. Motivated
by recent advances in the text document embedding literature, we present a new
method, called seq2vec, to represent a complete biological sequence in an
Euclidean space. The new representation has the potential to capture the
contextual information of the original sequence necessary for sequence
comparison tasks. We test our embeddings with protein sequence classification
and retrieval tasks and demonstrate encouraging outcomes.

impact on evolution of game. Basic model defines that probability of
cooperation depends linearly, both on the player's altruism and the co-player's
reputation. I propose modification of activation function to smooth one
(hyperbolic tangent with scaling parameter a, which corresponds to its shape)
and observe three phases for different range of a. (1) For small a, strategies
seem to randomly change in time and situation of mixed choices (one cooperates
and second defects) dominate. (2) For medium a, players choose only one
strategy for given period of time (the common state can switch to opposite one
with some probability). (3) For large a, mixed strategy (once defect, once
cooperate) is coexisting with common strategies and no change is allowed. I
believe that proposed function characterizes better socio-economical phenomena
and especially phase 1 and 2 contain most of human behavior.

1608.06107	q-bio	q-bio.BM	"Relaxing the Hypotheses of Symmetry and Time-Reversibility in Genome
  Evolutionary Models"	"  Various genome evolutionary models have been proposed these last decades to
predict the evolution of a DNA sequence over time, essentially described using
a mutation matrix. By essence, all of these models relate the evolution of DNA
sequences to the computation of the successive powers of the mutation matrix.
To make this computation possible, hypotheses are assumed for the matrix, such
as symmetry and time-reversibility, which are not compatible with mutation
rates that have been recently obtained experimentally on genes ura3 and can1 of
the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this work, authors investigate
systematically the possibility to relax either the symmetry or the
time-reversibility hypothesis of the mutation matrix, by investigating all the
possible matrices of size 2*2 and 3*3. As an application example, the
experimental study on the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used in order
to deduce a simple mutation matrix, and to compute the future evolution of the
rate purine/pyrimidine for $ura3$ on the one hand, and of the particular
behavior of cytosines and thymines compared to purines on the other hand.

1608.06132	q-bio	cs.NE q-bio.NC	"Reconstructing Neural Parameters and Synapses of arbitrary
  interconnected Neurons from their Simulated Spiking Activity"	"  To understand the behavior of a neural circuit it is a presupposition that we
have a model of the dynamical system describing this circuit. This model is
determined by several parameters, including not only the synaptic weights, but
also the parameters of each neuron. Existing works mainly concentrate on either
the synaptic weights or the neural parameters. In this paper we present an
algorithm to reconstruct all parameters including the synaptic weights of a
spiking neuron model. The model based on works of Eugene M. Izhikevich
(Izhikevich 2007) consists of two differential equations and covers different
types of cortical neurons. It combines the dynamical properties of
Hodgkin-Huxley-type dynamics with a high computational efficiency. The
presented algorithm uses the recordings of the corresponding membrane
potentials of the model for the reconstruction and consists of two main
components. The first component is a rank based Genetic Algorithm (GA) which is
used to find the neural parameters of the model. The second one is a Least Mean
Squares approach which computes the synaptic weights of all interconnected
neurons by minimizing the squared error between the calculated and the measured
membrane potentials for each time step. In preparation for the reconstruction
of the neural parameters and of the synaptic weights from real measured
membrane potentials, promising results based on simulated data generated with a
randomly parametrized Izhikevich model are presented. The reconstruction does
not only converge to a global minimum of neural parameters, but also
approximates the synaptic weights with high precision.

  Transmission in Benin and Its Implications for Cohort Study"	"  Malaria remains endemic in tropical areas, especially in Africa. For the
evaluation of new tools and to further ourunderstanding of host-parasite
interactions, knowing the environmental risk of transmission-even at a very
local scale-isessential. The aim of this study was to assess how malaria
transmission is influenced and can be predicted by local climaticand
environmental factors. As the entomological part of a cohort study of 650
newborn babies in nine villages in the ToriBossito district of Southern Benin
between June 2007 and February 2010, human landing catches were performed to
assessthe density of malaria vectors and transmission intensity. Climatic
factors as well as household characteristics were recordedthroughout the study.
Statistical correlations between Anopheles density and environmental and
climatic factors weretested using a three-level Poisson mixed regression model.
The results showed both temporal variations in vector density(related to season
and rainfall), and spatial variations at the level of both village and house.
These spatial variations could belargely explained by factors associated with
the house's immediate surroundings, namely soil type, vegetation index andthe
proximity of a watercourse. Based on these results, a predictive regression
model was developed using a leave-one-outmethod, to predict the spatiotemporal
variability of malaria transmission in the nine villages. This study points up
theimportance of local environmental factors in malaria transmission and
describes a model to predict the transmission risk ofindividual children, based
on environmental and behavioral characteristics.

1608.06242	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Some Models for Epidemics of Vector-Transmitted Diseases	"  Vector-transmitted diseases such as dengue fever and chikungunya have been
spreading rapidly in many parts of the world. The Zika virus has been known
since 1947 and invaded South America in 2013. It can be transmitted not only by
(mosquito) vectors but also directly through sexual contact. Zika has developed
into a serious global health problem because, while most cases are asymptomatic
or very light, babies born to Zika - infected mothers may develop microcephaly
and other very serious birth defects.
  We formulate and analyze two epidemic models for vector-transmitted diseases,
one appropriate for dengue and chikungunya fever outbreaks and one that
includes direct transmission appropriate for Zika virus outbreaks. This is
especially important because the Zika virus is the first example of a disease
that can be spread both indirectly through a vector and directly (through
sexual contact). In both cases, we obtain expressions for the basic
reproduction number and show how to use the initial exponential growth rate to
estimate the basic reproduction number. However, for the model that includes
direct transmission some additional data would be needed to identify the
fraction of cases transmitted directly. Data for the 2015 Zika virus outbreak
in Barranquilla, Colombia has been used to fit parameters to the model
developed here and to estimate the basic reproduction number.

1608.06277	q-bio	cs.CV q-bio.NC	"Fundamental principles of cortical computation: unsupervised learning
  with prediction, compression and feedback"	"  There has been great progress in understanding of anatomical and functional
microcircuitry of the primate cortex. However, the fundamental principles of
cortical computation - the principles that allow the visual cortex to bind
retinal spikes into representations of objects, scenes and scenarios - have so
far remained elusive. In an attempt to come closer to understanding the
fundamental principles of cortical computation, here we present a functional,
phenomenological model of the primate visual cortex. The core part of the model
describes four hierarchical cortical areas with feedforward, lateral, and
recurrent connections. The three main principles implemented in the model are
information compression, unsupervised learning by prediction, and use of
lateral and top-down context. We show that the model reproduces key aspects of
the primate ventral stream of visual processing including Simple and Complex
cells in V1, increasingly complicated feature encoding, and increased
separability of object representations in higher cortical areas. The model
learns representations of the visual environment that allow for accurate
classification and state-of-the-art visual tracking performance on novel
objects.

  tie-points"	"  The discovery of past spikes in atmospheric radiocarbon activity, caused by
major solar energetic particle events, has opened up new possibilities for
high-precision chronometry. The two spikes, or Miyake Events, have now been
widely identified in tree-rings that grew in the years 775 and 994 CE.
Furthermore, all other plant material that grew in these years would also have
incorporated the anomalously high concentrations of radiocarbon. Crucially,
some plant-based artefacts, such as papyrus documents, timber beams and linen
garments, can also be allocated to specific positions within long, currently
unfixed, historical sequences. Thus, Miyake Events represent a new source of
tie-points that could provide the means for anchoring early chronologies to the
absolute timescale. Here, we explore this possibility, outlining the most
expeditious approaches, the current challenges and obstacles, and how they
might best be overcome.

1608.06314	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Age-dependent Branching Processes and Applications to the
  Luria-Delbr\""uck Experiment"	"  Microbial populations adapt to their environment by acquiring advantageous
mutations, but in the early twentieth century, questions about how these
organisms acquire mutations arose. The experiment of Salvador Luria and Max
Delbr\""uck that won them a Nobel Prize in 1969 confirmed that mutations don't
occur out of necessity, but instead can occur many generations before there is
a selective advantage, and thus organisms follow Darwinian evolution instead of
Lamarckian. Since then, new areas of research involving microbial evolution
have spawned as a result of their experiment. Determining the mutation rate of
a cell is one such area. Probability distributions that determine the number of
mutants in a large population have been derived by D. E. Lea, C. A. Coulson,
and J. B. S. Haldane. However, not much work has been done when time of cell
division is dependent on the cell age, and even less so when cell division is
asymmetric, which is the case in most microbial populations. Using probability
generating function methods, we rigorously construct a probability distribution
for the cell population size given a life-span distribution for both mother and
daughter cells, and then determine its asymptotic growth rate. We use this to
construct a probability distribution for the number of mutants in a large cell
population, which can be used with likelihood methods to estimate the cell
mutation rate.

thousands of neurons are recorded simultaneously. Currently, there is little
consensus on how such data should be analyzed. Here we introduce LFADS (Latent
Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems), a method to infer latent dynamics from
simultaneously recorded, single-trial, high-dimensional neural spiking data.
LFADS is a sequential model based on a variational auto-encoder. By making a
dynamical systems hypothesis regarding the generation of the observed data,
LFADS reduces observed spiking to a set of low-dimensional temporal factors,
per-trial initial conditions, and inferred inputs. We compare LFADS to existing
methods on synthetic data and show that it significantly out-performs them in
inferring neural firing rates and latent dynamics.

some wild populations, originating from the North Tunisia (4 populations of
Medicago ciliaris and 3 populations of Medicago intertexta). Previous finding
revealed that these species are genetically distinct and easily recognized by
the number of flowers per inflorescence and pod dimensions. However,
biometrical traits and isozyme patterns intermediacy between these two species
had detected the existence of a potential spontaneous interspecific hybrid
originating from Sedjnane locality in Tunisia. Indeed, the present work has
shown significant decrease of pollen fertility and seed production for this
population when compared to the others(pollen viability 75%, pollen
germinability 8% and pod production=9%). These results suggested a possible
natural interspecific hybrid and confirming introgressive hybridization
possibility between M. intertexta and M. ciliaris.

Our model assumes low-dimensional continuous dynamics in a finite volume. It
incorporates a prior assumption about globally contractional dynamics to avoid
overly enthusiastic extrapolation outside of the support of observed

aims at predicting the best orientation and conformation of a small drug
molecule when bound to a target large protein receptor. The docking quality is
typically measured by a scoring function: a mathematical predictive model that
produces a score representing the binding free energy and hence the stability
of the resulting complex molecule. We analyze the performance of both learning
techniques on the scoring power, the ranking power, docking power, and
screening power using the PDBbind 2013 database. For the scoring and ranking
powers, the proposed learning scoring functions depend on a wide range of
features (energy terms, pharmacophore, intermolecular) that entirely
characterize the protein-ligand complexes. For the docking and screening
powers, the proposed learning scoring functions depend on the intermolecular
features of the RF-Score to utilize a larger number of training complexes. For
the scoring power, the DL\_RF scoring function achieves Pearson's correlation
coefficient between the predicted and experimentally measured binding
affinities of 0.799 versus 0.758 of the RF scoring function. For the ranking
power, the DL scoring function ranks the ligands bound to fixed target protein
with accuracy 54% for the high-level ranking and with accuracy 78% for the
low-level ranking while the RF scoring function achieves (46% and 62%)
respectively. For the docking power, the DL\_RF scoring function has a success
rate when the three best-scored ligand binding poses are considered within 2
\AA\ root-mean-square-deviation from the native pose of 36.0% versus 30.2% of
the RF scoring function. For the screening power, the DL scoring function has
an average enrichment factor and success rate at the top 1% level of (2.69 and
6.45%) respectively versus (1.61 and 4.84%) respectively of the RF scoring
function.

probability c synaptic intensities are chosen according with a Hebbian
prescription, and with probability (1-c) there is an extra random contribution
to synaptic weights. This new term, randomly taken from a Gaussian bimodal
distribution, balances the synaptic population in the network so that one has
80-20 relation in E/I population ratio, mimicking the balance observed in
mammals cortex. For some regions of the relevant parameters, our system depicts
standard memory (at low temperature) and non-memory attractors (at high
temperature). However, as c decreases and the level of the underlying noise
also decreases below a certain temperature T_t, a kind of memory-frustrated
state, which resembles spin-glass behavior, sharply emerges. Contrary to what
occurs in Hopfield-like neural networks, the frustrated state appears here even
in the limit of the loading parameter alpha-->0. Moreover, we observed that the
frustrated state in fact corresponds to two states of non-vanishing activity
uncorrelated with stored memories, associated, respectively, to a high activity
or Up state and to a low activity or Down state. Using a linear stability
analysis, we found regions in the space of relevant parameters for locally
stable steady states and demonstrated that frustrated states coexist with
memory attractors below T_t. Then, multistability between memory and frustrated
states is present for relatively small c, and metastability of memory
attractors can emerge as c decreases even more. We studied our system using
standard mean-field techniques and with Monte Carlo simulations, obtaining a
perfect agreement between theory and simulations. Our study can be useful to

  Software and a Case Study in Protein Biology"	"  Independent computational reproducibility of scientific results is rapidly
becoming of pivotal importance in scientific progress as computation itself
plays a more and more central role in so many branches of science.
Historically, reproducibility has followed the familiar Popperian [38] model
whereby theory cannot be verified by scientific testing, it can only be
falsified. Ultimately, this implies that if an experiment cannot be reproduced
independently to some satisfactory level of precision, its value is essentially
unquantifiable; put brutally, it is impossible to determine its scientific
value. The burgeoning presence of software in most scientific work adds a new
and particularly opaque layer of complexity [29]. In spite of much recent
interest in many scientific areas, emphasis remains more on procedures,
strictures and discussion [12, 14, 16, 29, 30, 37, 41], reflecting the
inexperience of most scientific journals when it comes to software, rather than
the details of how computational reproducibility is actually achieved, for
which there appear to be relatively few guiding examples [6, 10, 17]. After
considering basic principles, here we show how full computational
reproducibility can be achieved in practice at every stage using a case study
of a multi-gigabyte protein study on the open SwissProt protein database, from
data download all the way to individual figure by figure reproduction as an
exemplar for general scientific computation.

1608.06918	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio.TO	Growth and Scaling during Development and Regeneration	"  Life presents fascinating examples of self-organization and emergent
phenomena. In multi-cellular organisms, a multitude of cells interact to form
and maintain highly complex body plans of well-defined size. In this thesis, we
investigate theoretical feedback mechanisms for both self-organized body plan
patterning and size control.
  The thesis is inspired by the astonishing scaling and regeneration abilities
of flatworms. These worms can perfectly regrow their entire body plan even from
tiny amputation fragments like the tip of the tail. Moreover, they can grow and
actively de-grow by more than a factor of 40 in length depending on feeding
conditions. These capabilities prompt for remarkable physical mechanisms of
self-organized pattern formation and scaling.
  First, we explore the basic principles and challenges of pattern scaling in
mechanisms previously proposed to describe biological pattern formation. Next,
we present a novel class of patterning mechanisms yielding entirely
self-organized and self-scaling patterns. This framework captures essential
features of body plan regeneration and scaling in flatworms. Further, we
analyze shape and motility of flatworms. By applying principal component
analysis, we characterize shape dynamics during different motility modes and
also identify shape variations between different flatworm species. Finally, we
investigate the metabolic control of cell turnover and growth. We identify
three mechanisms of metabolic energy storage; theoretical descriptions thereof

1608.06971	q-bio	q-bio.BM cond-mat.soft cond-mat.stat-mech physics.bio-ph	Protein Collapse is Encoded in the Folded State Architecture	"  Natural protein sequences that self-assemble to form globular structures are
compact with high packing densities in the folded states. It is known that
proteins unfold upon addition of denaturants, adopting random coil structures.
The dependence of the radii of gyration on protein size in the folded and
unfolded states obeys the same scaling laws as synthetic polymers. Thus, one
might surmise that the mechanism of collapse in proteins and polymers ought to
be similar. However, because the number of amino acids in single domain
proteins is not significantly greater than about two hundred, it has not been
resolved if the unfolded states of proteins are compact under conditions that
favor the folded states - a problem at the heart of how proteins fold. By
adopting a theory used to derive polymer-scaling laws, we find that the
propensity for the unfolded state of a protein to be compact is universal and
is encoded in the contact map of the folded state. Remarkably, analysis of over
2000 proteins shows that proteins rich in $\beta$-sheets have greater tendency
to be compact than $\alpha$-helical proteins. The theory provides insights into
the reasons for the small size of single domain proteins and the physical basis
for the origin of multi-domain proteins. Application to non-coding RNA
molecules show that they have evolved to collapse sharing similarities to
$\beta$-sheet proteins. An implication of our theory is that the evolution of
natural foldable sequences is guided by the requirement that for efficient
folding they should populate minimum energy compact states under folding
conditions. This concept also supports the compaction selection hypothesis used
to rationalize the unusually condensed states of viral RNA molecules.

simulation algorithms allow sample from the the system configuration. Although
many algorithms have been described, no fast implementation has been provided
for {\tau}-leaping which i) is Matlab-compatible, ii) adap- tively alternates
between SSA, implicit and explicit {\tau}-leaping, and iii) provides summary

Matlab-compatible implementation of the adap- tive explicit-implicit
{\tau}-leaping algorithm to address the above-mentioned deficits. matLeap
provides equal or substantially faster results compared to two widely used
simulation packages while maintaining accuracy. Lastly, matLeap yields summary
statistics of the stochastic process unavailable with other methods, which are
indispensable for Bayesian inference. Conclusions: matLeap addresses
shortcomings in existing Matlab-compatible stochastic simulation software,

  Polymorphism at a critical extension"	"  In order to interpret recent experimental studies of the dependence of
conductance of ds-DNA as the DNA is pulled from the 3'end1-3'end2 ends, which
find a sharp conductance jump for a very short (4.5 %) stretching length, we
carried out multiscale modeling, to predict the conductance of dsDNA as it is
mechanically stretched to promote various structural polymorphisms. We
calculate the current along the stretched DNA using a combination of molecular
dynamics simulations, non-equilibrium pulling simulations, quantum mechanics
calculations, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. For 5'end1-5'end2
attachments we find an abrupt jump in the current within a very short
stretching length (6 $ \AA $ or 17 %) leading to a melted DNA state. In
contrast, for 3'end1-3'end2 pulling it takes almost 32$ \AA $ (84 %) of
stretching to cause a similar jump in the current. Thus, we demonstrate that
charge transport in DNA can occur over stretching lengths of several
nanometers. We find that this unexpected behaviour in the B to S conformational
DNA transition arises from highly inclined base pair geometries that result
from this pulling protocol. We find that the dramatically different conductance
behaviors for two different pulling protocols arise from the nature of how
hydrogen bonds of DNA base pairs break.

  growing new tissue"	"  The growth of several biological tissues is known to be controlled in part by
local geometrical features, such as the curvature of the tissue interface. This
control leads to changes in tissue shape that in turn can affect the tissue's
evolution. Understanding the cellular basis of this control is highly
significant for bioscaffold tissue engineering, the evolution of bone
microarchitecture, wound healing, and tumour growth. While previous models have
proposed geometrical relationships between tissue growth and curvature, the
role of cell density and cell vigor remains poorly understood. We propose a
cell-based mathematical model of tissue growth to investigate the systematic
influence of curvature on the collective crowding or spreading of
tissue-synthesising cells induced by changes in local tissue surface area
during the motion of the interface. Depending on the strength of diffusive
damping, the model exhibits complex growth patterns such as undulating motion,
efficient smoothing of irregularities, and the generation of cusps. We compare
this model with in-vitro experiments of tissue deposition in bioscaffolds of
different geometries. By accounting for the depletion of active cells, the
model is able to capture both smoothing of initial substrate geometry and
tissue deposition slowdown as observed experimentally.

1608.07139	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio.SC	"Time-dependent solutions for a stochastic model of gene expression with
  molecule production in the form of a compound Poisson process"	"  We study a stochastic model of gene expression, in which protein production
has a form of random bursts whose size distribution is arbitrary, whereas
protein decay is a first-order reaction. We find exact analytical expressions
for the time evolution of the cumulant-generating function for the most general
case when both the burst size probability distribution and the model parameters
depend on time in an arbitrary (e.g. oscillatory) manner, and for arbitrary
initial conditions. We show that in the case of periodic external activation
and constant protein degradation rate, the response of the gene is analogous to
the RC low-pass filter, where slow oscillations of the external driving have a
greater effect on gene expression than the fast ones. We also demonstrate that
the $n$-th cumulant of the protein number distribution depends on the $n$-th
moment of the burst size distribution. We use these results to show that
different measures of noise (coefficient of variation, Fano factor, fractional
change of variance) may vary in time in a different manner. Therefore, any
biological hypothesis of evolutionary optimization based on the nonmonotonicity
of a chosen measure of noise must justify why it assumes that biological
evolution quantifies noise in that particular way. Finally, we show that not
only for exponentially distributed burst sizes but also for a wider class of
burst size distributions (e.g. Dirac delta and gamma) the control of gene
expression level by burst frequency modulation gives rise to proportional
scaling of variance of the protein number distribution to its mean, whereas the
control by amplitude modulation implies proportionality of protein number
variance to the mean squared.

  without nonlinear chemistry"	"  We propose a model solely based on actin treadmilling and polymerisation
which describes many characteristic states of actin wave formation: spots,
spirals and travelling waves. In our model, as in experiments on cell
recovering motility following actin depolymerisation, we choose an isotropic
low density initial condition; polymerisation of actin filaments then raises
the density towards the Onsager threshold where they align. We show that this
alignment, in turn, destabilizes the isotropic phase and generically induces
transient actin spots or spirals as part of the dynamical pathway towards a
polarized phase which can either be uniform or consist of a series of
actin-wave trains (flocks). Our results uncover a universal route to actin wave
formation in the absence of any system specific nonlinear biochemistry, and it
may help understand the mechanism underlying the observation of actin spots and
waves in vivo. They also suggest a minimal setup to design similar patterns in
vitro.

1608.07232	q-bio	q-bio.TO	Toward a closed-loop subcutaneous delivery of L-DOPA	"  L-DOPA has been the gold standard treatment for Parkinson's disease since 50
years. Being the direct biochemical precursor of dopamine, L-DOPA is
effectively converted in the brain, but two major phenomena reduce its
therapeutic action: i) competition with amino acids in the gut wall and in the
blood brain barrier and ii) its fast kinetics (absorption, distribution,
metabolism, and elimination). Continuous administration of L-DOPA, such as
jejunal pumps, have addressed the issue of fast absorption. Considering a
subcutaneous delivery of L-DOPA allows to bypass the gastrointestinal tract and
avoid competition with dietary amino acids. Remains the competition at the
blood barrier between amino acids and L-DOPA, which we address by proposing a
closed-loop controlled, continuous subcutaneous delivery pump. In the
proof-of-concept format, the delivery strategy evaluated on comprehensive model
of L-DOPA kinetics, holds the promise of improving the treatment of late-stage
Parkinson's disease patients.

in which the participants were asked to balance between their speed and
accuracy to maximize the total reward they achieve during the experiment. The
results of computational modeling provided strong evidence suggesting that the
participants used time-varying decision boundaries. Previous theoretical
studies of the optimal speed-accuracy trade-off suggested that the participants
may learn to use these time-varying boundaries to maximize their average reward
rate. The results in our experiment, however, showed that the participants used
such boundaries even at the beginning of the experiment and without any prior
experience in the task. In this paper, we hypothesize that these boundaries are
the results of using some heuristic rules to make decisions in the task. To
formulate decision making by these heuristic rules as a computational
framework, we use the fuzzy logic theory. Based on this theory, we propose a
new computational framework for decision making in evidence accumulation tasks.
In this framework, there is no explicit decision boundary. Instead, the
subject's desire to stop accumulating evidence and responding at each moment
within a trial and for a given value of the accumulated evidence, is determined
by a set of fuzzy ""IF-TEHN rules"". We then use the back-propagation method to
derive an algorithm for fitting the fuzzy model to each participant's data. We
then investigate how the difference in the participants' performance in the
experiment is reflected in the difference in the parameters of the fitted model

scaling of time. In human cancer, genetic perturbations alter death's curvature
of time. Those changes in scale and curvature follow the constraining contours
of death's invariant geometry. I show that the constraints arise from a
fundamental extension to the theories of randomness, invariance and scale. A
generalized Gompertz law follows. The constraints imposed by the invariant
Gompertz geometry explain the tendency of perturbations to stretch or bend
death's scaling of time. Variability in death rate arises from a combination of
constraining universal laws and particular biological processes.

1608.07440	q-bio	q-bio.QM cs.AI	Activity Networks with Delays An application to toxicity analysis	"  ANDy , Activity Networks with Delays, is a discrete time framework aimed at
the qualitative modelling of time-dependent activities. The modular and concise
syntax makes ANDy suitable for an easy and natural modelling of time-dependent
biological systems (i.e., regulatory pathways). Activities involve entities
playing the role of activators, inhibitors or products of biochemical network
operation. Activities may have given duration, i.e., the time required to
obtain results. An entity may represent an object (e.g., an agent, a
biochemical species or a family of thereof) with a local attribute, a state
denoting its level (e.g., concentration, strength). Entities levels may change
as a result of an activity or may decay gradually as time passes by. The
semantics of ANDy is formally given via high-level Petri nets ensuring this way
some modularity. As main results we show that ANDy systems have finite state
representations even for potentially infinite processes and it well adapts to
the modelling of toxic behaviours. As an illustration, we present a
classification of toxicity properties and give some hints on how they can be
verified with existing tools on ANDy systems. A small case study on blood
glucose regulation is provided to exemplify the ANDy framework and the toxicity
properties.

(pppGpp) bind to target proteins to promote bacterial survival (Corrigan et al.
2016). Thus, the binding of the nucleotides to RsgA, a GTPase, inhibits the
hydrolysis of GTP. The dose response, taken to be curvilinear with respect to
the logarithm of the inhibitor concentration, is instead much better (P<0.001
when the 6 experiments are combined) represented as multiphasic, with high to
exceedingly high absolute r values for the straight lines, and with transitions
in the form of non-contiguities (jumps). Profiles for the binding of
radiolabeled nucleotides to HprT and Gmk, GTP synthesis enzymes, were,
similarly, taken to be curvilinear with respect to the logarithm of the protein
concentration. However, the profiles are again much better represented as
multiphasic than as curvilinear (the P values range from 0.047 to <0.001 for
each of the 8 experiments for binding of ppGpp and pppGpp to HprT). The binding
of GTP to HprT and the binding of the three nucleotides to Gmk are also poorly
represented by curvilinear profiles, but well represented by multiphasic
profiles (straight and, in part, parallel lines).

irreversible, dynamic neurodegenerative sickness. It is the main source of
age-related dementia, influencing roughly 5.3 million individuals in the United
States alone. Promotion is a typical feeble ailment in individuals more than 65
years, bringing on disability described by decrease in memory, failure to learn
and do every day exercises, intellectual weakness and influences the personal
satisfaction of patients. Pathologic qualities of AD are an irregular
development of specific proteins called Beta-amyloid ""plaques"" and Tau
""Tangles"" in the mind. Notwithstanding, current treatments against AD are just
to calm manifestations and palliative yet are not the cure and a few promising
medications competitors have fizzled in late clinical trials. There is
consequently a critical need to enhance our comprehension for pathogenesis of
this sickness, making new and creative prescient models with powerful
treatments. As of late, stem cell treatment has been appeared to have a
potential way to deal with different illnesses, including neurodegenerative
disorders. In light of the far reaching nature of AD pathology, stem cell
substitution procedures have been seen as an extraordinarily difficult and
impossible treatment approach. Stem Cell may likewise offer an effective new
way to deal with model and concentrate AD. Patient derived induced Pluripotent
Stem Cells (iPSCs), for instance, may propel our comprehension of disease
mechanism. In this review we will examine the capability of stem cells to help

raised interesting questions about the spread of ideas and fads within our

fall of MySpace and to predict a rapid drop in the popularity of Facebook. Here
we explore the irSIR model and two of its logical extensions and we
mathematically characterize the initial and long-run behavior of these
dynamical systems. In particular, while the original irSIR model always
predicts extinction of a social epidemic, we construct an extension of the

particular interest is the neocortex,the part of the brain that is especially
large in humans, capable of handling a wide variety of tasks including visual,
auditory, language, motor, and abstract processing. These functionalities are
processed in different self-organized regions of the neocortical sheet, and yet
the anatomical structure carrying out the processing is relatively uniform
across the sheet. We are at a loss to explain, simulate, or understand such a
multi-functional homogeneous sheet-like computational structure - we do not
have computational models which work in this way. Here we present an important
step towards developing such models: we show how uniform modules of excitatory
and inhibitory neurons can be connected bidirectionally in a network that, when
exposed to input in the form of population codes, learns the input encodings as
well as the relationships between the inputs. STDP learning rules lead the
modules to self-organize into a relational network, which is able to infer
missing inputs,restore noisy signals, decide between conflicting inputs, and
combine cues to improve estimates. These networks show that it is possible for
a homogeneous network of spiking units to self-organize so as to provide
meaningful processing of its inputs. If such networks can be scaled up, they
could provide an initial computational model relevant to the large scale
anatomy of the neocortex.

1608.08314	q-bio	q-bio.PE math.DS	Evolution of natal dispersal in spatially heterogenous environments	"  Understanding the evolution of dispersal is an important issue in
evolutionary ecology. For continuous time models in which individuals disperse
throughout their lifetime, it has been shown that a balanced dispersal
strategy, which results in an ideal free distribution, is evolutionary stable
in spatially varying but temporally constant environments. Many species,
however, primarily disperse prior to reproduction (natal dispersal) and less
commonly between reproductive events (breeding dispersal). As demographic and
dispersal terms combine in a multiplicative way for models of natal dispersal,
rather than the additive way for the previously studied models, we develop new
mathematical methods to study the evolution of natal dispersal for
continuous-time and discrete-time models. A fundamental ecological dichotomy is
identified for the non-trivial equilibrium of these models: (i) the per-capita
growth rates for individuals in all patches is equal to zero, or (ii)
individuals in some patches experience negative per-capita growth rates, while
individuals in other patches experience positive per-capita growth rates. The
first possibility corresponds to an ideal-free distribution, while the second
possibility corresponds to a ""source-sink"" spatial structure. We prove that
populations with a dispersal strategy leading to an ideal-free distribution
displace populations with dispersal strategy leading to a source-sink spatial
structure. When there are patches which can not sustain a population,
ideal-free strategies can be achieved by sedentary populations, and we show
that these populations can displace populations with any irreducible dispersal
strategy. Collectively, these results support that evolution selects for natal
or breeding dispersal strategies which lead to ideal-free distributions in
spatially heterogenous, but temporally homogenous, environments.

systematically applied to multiple proteins by Mu$\tilde{\rm n}$oz and Eaton
and has since been referred to as the Wako-Sait$\hat{\rm o}$-Mu$\tilde{\rm
n}$oz-Eaton (WSME) model. The success of the WSME model in explaining the
folding of many proteins has verified the hypothesis that the folding is
dominated by native interactions, which makes the energy landscape globally
biased toward native conformation. Using the WSME and other related models,
Sait$\hat{\rm o}$ emphasized the importance of the hierarchical pathway in
protein folding; folding starts with the creation of contiguous segments having
a native-like configuration and proceeds as growth and coalescence of these
segments. The $\phi$-values calculated for barnase with the WSME model
suggested that segments contributing to the folding nucleus are similar to the
structural modules defined by the pattern of native atomic contacts. The WSME
model was extended to explain folding of multi-domain proteins having a complex
topology, which opened the way to comprehensively understanding the folding
process of multi-domain proteins. The WSME model was also extended to describe
allosteric transitions, indicating that the allosteric structural movement does
not occur as a deterministic sequential change between two conformations but as
a stochastic diffusive motion over the dynamically changing energy landscape.
Statistical mechanical viewpoint on folding, as highlighted by the WSME model,
has been renovated in the context of modern methods and ideas, and will
continue to provide insights on equilibrium and dynamical features of proteins.

fundamental theory of consciousness. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) has
gained attention in this regard due to its theoretically strong framework.
However, it faces some limitations such as current state dependence,
computationally expensive and inability to be applied to real brain data. On
the other hand, Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) is a clinical measure for
distinguishing different levels of consciousness. Though PCI claims to capture
the functional differentiation and integration in brain networks (similar to
IIT), its link to integrated information theories is rather weak. Inspired by
these two approaches, we propose a new measure - $\Phi^C$ using a novel
compression-complexity perspective that serves as a bridge between the two, for
the first time. $\Phi^C$ is founded on the principles of lossless data
compression based complexity measures which characterize the dynamical
complexity of brain networks. $\Phi^{C}$ exhibits following salient
innovations: (i) mathematically well bounded, (ii) negligible current state
dependence unlike $\Phi$, (iii) integrated information measured as
compression-complexity rather than as an infotheoretic quantity, and (iv)
faster to compute since number of atomic bipartitions scales linearly with the
number of nodes of the network, thus avoiding combinatorial explosion. Our
computer simulations show that $\Phi^C$ has similar hierarchy to $<\Phi>$ for
several multiple-node networks and it demonstrates a rich interplay between
differentiation, integration and entropy of the nodes of a network. $\Phi^C$ is
a promising heuristic measure to characterize the quantity of integrated
information (and hence a measure of quantity of consciousness) in larger
networks like human brain and provides an opportunity to test the predictions
of brain complexity on real neural data.

Extending earlier experiments based on the Attention Network Test (ANT),
separating the neural components of alertness and spatial re-orientation from
the attention involved in more demanding conflict resolution tasks, we
demonstrate that these signatures of attention are so robust that they may be
retrieved even when applying low cost eye tracking in an everyday mobile
computing context. Furthermore we find that the reaction of surprise elicited

  systems perspective"	"  Species or population that proliferate faster than others become dominant in
numbers. Catalysis allows catalytic sets within a molecular reaction network to
dominate the non catalytic parts of the network by processing most of the
available substrate. As a consequence one may consider a 'catalytic fitness' of
sets of molecular species. The fittest sets emerge as the expressed chemical
backbone or sub-network of larger chemical reaction networks employed by
organisms. However, catalytic fitness depends on the systemic context and the
stability of systemic dynamics. Unstable reaction networks would easily be
reshaped or destroyed by fluctuations of the chemical environment. In this
paper we therefore focus on recognizing systemic stability as an evolutionary
selection criterion. In fact, instabilities of regulatory systems dynamics
become predictive for associated evolutionary forces driving the emergence
large reaction networks that avoid or control inherent instabilities. Systemic
instabilities can be identified and analyzed using relatively simple
mathematical random networks models of complex regulatory systems. Using a
statistical ensemble approach one can identify fundamental causes of instable
dynamics, infer evolutionary preferred network properties, and predict
evolutionary emergent control mechanisms and their entanglement with cell
differentiation processes. Surprisingly, what systemic stability tells us here
is that cells (or other non-linear regulatory systems) never had to learn how
to differentiate, but rather how to avoid and control differentiation. For
example, in this framework we can predict that regulatory systems will
evolutionary favor networks where the number of catalytic enhancers is not
larger than the number of suppressors.

Nanovesicular exosomes play a role in immunity, but to date their exact

top of a given network with edge weights corresponding to the transmission
probabilities. Knowledge of veracious transmission probabilities is essential
for prediction, optimization, and control of diffusion dynamics. Unfortunately,
in most cases the transmission rates are unknown and need to be reconstructed
from the spreading data. Moreover, in realistic settings it is impossible to
monitor the state of each node at every time, and thus the data is highly
incomplete. We introduce an efficient dynamic message-passing algorithm, which
is able to reconstruct parameters of the spreading model given only partial
information on the activation times of nodes in the network. The method is
generalizable to a large class of dynamic models, as well to the case of
temporal graphs.

  Inferring Well Supported Phylogenetic Trees"	"  The amount of completely sequenced chloroplast genomes increases rapidly
every day, leading to the possibility to build large-scale phylogenetic trees
of plant species. Considering a subset of close plant species defined according
to their chloroplasts, the phylogenetic tree that can be inferred by their core
genes is not necessarily well supported, due to the possible occurrence of
problematic genes (i.e., homoplasy, incomplete lineage sorting, horizontal gene
transfers, etc.) which may blur the phylogenetic signal. However, a trustworthy
phylogenetic tree can still be obtained provided such a number of blurring
genes is reduced. The problem is thus to determine the largest subset of core
genes that produces the best-supported tree. To discard problematic genes and
due to the overwhelming number of possible combinations, this article focuses
on how to extract the largest subset of sequences in order to obtain the most
supported species tree. Due to computational complexity, a distributed Binary
Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) is proposed in sequential and distributed
fashions. Obtained results from both versions of the BPSO are compared with
those computed using an hybrid approach embedding both genetic algorithms and
statistical tests. The proposal has been applied to different cases of plant
families, leading to encouraging results for these families.

  system modelling tumour growth"	"  We study the existence of weak solutions to a Cahn--Hilliard--Darcy system
coupled with a convection-reaction-diffusion equation through the fluxes,
through the source terms and in Darcy's law. The system of equations arises
from a mixture model for tumour growth accounting for transport mechanisms such
as chemotaxis and active transport. We prove, via a Galerkin approximation, the
existence of global weak solutions in two and three dimensions, along with new
regularity results for the velocity field and for the pressure. Due to the
coupling with the Darcy system, the time derivatives have lower regularity
compared to systems without Darcy flow, but in the two dimensional case we
employ a new regularity result for the velocity to obtain better integrability
and temporal regularity for the time derivatives. Then, we deduce the global
existence of weak solutions for two variants of the model; one where the
velocity is zero and another where the chemotaxis and active transport
mechanisms are absent.

increasing interest to the neuroscientific community, largely because of its
potential to illuminate human cognition, its variation over development and
aging, and its alteration in disease or injury. Traditional tools and
approaches to study this architecture have largely focused on single scales --
of topology, time, and space. Expanding beyond this narrow view, we focus this
review on pertinent questions and novel methodological advances for the
multi-scale brain. We separate our exposition into content related to
multi-scale topological structure, multi-scale temporal structure, and
multi-scale spatial structure. In each case, we recount empirical evidence for
such structures, survey network-based methodological approaches to reveal these
structures, and outline current frontiers and open questions. Although
predominantly peppered with examples from human neuroimaging, we hope that this
account will offer an accessible guide to any neuroscientist aiming to measure,
characterize, and understand the full richness of the brain's multiscale
network structure -- irrespective of species, imaging modality, or spatial
resolution.

  Rock-Paper-Scissors Games"	"  We consider a two-dimensional model of three species in rock-paper-scissors
competition and study the self-organisation of the population into fascinating
spiraling patterns. Within our individual-based metapopulation formulation, the
population composition changes due to cyclic dominance (dominance-removal and
dominance-replacement), mutations, and pair-exchange of neighboring
individuals. Here, we study the influence of mobility on the emerging patterns
and investigate when the pair-exchange rate is responsible for spiral waves to
become elusive in stochastic lattice simulations. In particular, we show that
the spiral waves predicted by the system's deterministic partial equations are
found in lattice simulations only within a finite range of the mobility rate.
We also report that in the absence of mutations and dominance-replacement, the
resulting spiraling patterns are subject to convective instability and
far-field breakup at low mobility rate. Possible applications of these
resolution and far-field breakup phenomena are discussed.

obtained from cytochrome C7 found in Geobacter sulfurreducens, PPCA protein can
interact with Deoxycholate (DXCA), while its other homologs do not, as observed
from the crystal structures. Utilizing the concept of 'structure-function
relationship', an effort has been initiated towards understanding the driving
force for recognition of DXCA exclusively by PPCA among its homologs. Further,
a combinatorial analysis of the binding sequences (contiguous sequence of amino
acid residues of binding locations) is performed to build graph-theoretic
models, which show that PPCA differs from its homologues. Analysis of the
results suggests that the underlying impetus of recognition of DXCA by PPCA is
embedded in its primary sequence and 3D conformation.

societies, and they continue to do so today. To help reduce their impact,
mathematical models of disease transmission have been studied to help
understand disease dynamics and inform prevention strategies. Vaccination - one
of the most important preventive measures of modern times - is of great
interest both theoretically and empirically. And in contrast to traditional
approaches, recent research increasingly explores the pivotal implications of
individual behavior and heterogeneous contact patterns in populations. Our
report reviews the developmental arc of theoretical epidemiology with emphasis
on vaccination, as it led from classical models assuming homogeneously mixing
(mean-field) populations and ignoring human behavior, to recent models that
account for behavioral feedback and/or population spatial/social structure.
Many of the methods used originated in statistical physics, such as lattice and
network models, and their associated analytical frameworks. Similarly, the
feedback loop between vaccinating behavior and disease propagation forms a
coupled nonlinear system with analogs in physics. We also review the new
paradigm of digital epidemiology, wherein sources of digital data such as
online social media are mined for high-resolution information on
epidemiologically relevant individual behavior. Armed with the tools and
concepts of statistical physics, and further assisted by new sources of digital
data, models that capture nonlinear interactions between behavior and disease
dynamics offer a novel way of modeling real-world phenomena, and can help
improve health outcomes. We conclude the review by discussing open problems in
the field and promising directions for future research.

  Kidney"	"  In this paper, we investigate the physical mechanisms underlying one of the
most efficient filtration devices: the kidney. Building on a minimal model of
the Henle loop - the central part of the kidney filtration - we investigate
theoretically the detailed out-of-equilibrium fluxes in this separation process
in order to obtain absolute theoretical bounds for its efficiency in terms of
separation ability and energy consumption. We demonstrate that this separation
process operates at a remarkably small energy cost as compared to traditional
sieving processes while working at much smaller pressures. This unique
energetic efficiency originates in the double-loop geometry of the nephron,
which operates as an active osmotic exchanger. The principles for an
artificial-kidney-inspired filtration device could be readily mimicked based on
existing soft technologies to build compact and low-energy artificial dialytic
devices. Such a ""kidney on a chip"" also points to new avenues for advanced
water recycling, targeting, in particular, sea-water pretreatment for
decontamination and hardness reduction.

  dynamics of biopolymers"	"  The description of the dynamics of a complex, high-dimensional system in
terms of a low-dimensional set of collective variables Y can be fruitful if the
low dimensional representation satisfies a Langevin equation with drift and
diffusion coefficients which depend only on Y. We present a computational
scheme to evaluate whether a given collective variable provides a faithful
low-dimensional representation of the dynamics of a high-dimensional system.
The scheme is based on the framework of finite-difference Langevin-equation,
similar to that used for molecular-dynamics simulations. This allows one to
calculate the drift and diffusion coefficients in any point of the
full-dimensional system. The width of the distribution of drift and diffusion
coefficients in an ensemble of microscopic points at the same value of Y
indicates to which extent the dynamics of Y is described by a simple Langevin
equation. Using a simple protein model we show that collective variables often
used to describe biopolymers display a non-negligible width both in the drift
and in the diffusion coefficients. We also show that the associated effective
force is compatible with the equilibrium free--energy calculated from a
microscopic sampling, but results in markedly different dynamical properties.

growing field with significant potential for future smart personalised systems.
Working in this emerging field requires comprehension of an array of
physiological signals and analysis techniques.
  Methods to study central nervous system (CNS) are usually expensive and
laborious. However, electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most affordable
and ambulatory methodologies for CNS research. It is in use in various clinical
studies and have been broadly studied over decades. Despite that the recorded
EEG signals are quite prone to noise and environmental factors it is the most
widely used method in study of brain-computer interaction (BCI). Here we
discuss briefly on various aspects of the recorded signals, their
interpretation, and usage in the field of interaction studies.
  This paper aims to serve as a primer for the novice, enabling rapid
familiarisation with the latest core concepts. We put special emphasis on
everyday human-computer interface applications to distinguish from the more
common clinical or sports uses of psychophysiology.

the graph-theoretic characterization of protein-protein interaction networks

ecological communities, and understanding how such a variability influences the
biodiversity of an ecosystem is a major question in ecology. In this paper, we
analyze the case of two species competing for the resources within the
framework of the neutral theory in the presence of environmental noise,
devoting special attention on how such a variability modulates species fitness.
The environment is dichotomous and stochastically alternates between periods
favoring one of the species while disfavoring the other one, preserving
neutrality on the long term. We study two different scenarios: in the first one
species fitness varies linearly with the environment, and in the second one the
effective fitness is re-scaled by the total fitness of the individuals
competing for the same resource. We find that, in the former case environmental
fluctuations always reduce the time of species coexistence, whereas such a time
can be enhanced or reduced in the latter case, depending on the correlation
time of the environment. This phenomenon can be understood as a direct
consequence of Chesson's storage effect.

1609.00620	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Bone Remodeling as a Spatial Evolutionary Game	"  Bone remodeling is a complex process involving cell-cell interactions,
biochemical signaling and mechanical stimuli. Early models of the biological
aspects of remodeling were non-spatial and focused on the local dynamics at a
fixed location in the bone. Several spatial extensions of these models have
been proposed, but they generally suffer from two limitations: first, they are
not amenable to analysis and are computationally expensive, and second, they
neglect the role played by bone-embedded osteocytes. To address these issues,
we developed a novel model of spatial remodeling based on the principles of
evolutionary game theory. The analytically tractable framework describes the
spatial interactions between zones of bone resorption, bone formation and
quiescent bone, and explicitly accounts for regulation of remodeling by
bone-embedded, mechanotransducing osteocytes. Using tools from the theory of
interacting particle systems we systematically classified the different dynamic
regimes of the spatial model and identified regions of parameter space that
allow for coexistence of resorption, formation and quiescence, as observed in
physiological remodeling. In coexistence scenarios, three-dimensional
simulations revealed the emergence of sponge-like bone clusters. Comparison
between spatial and non-spatial dynamics revealed substantial differences and
suggested a stabilizing role of space. Our findings emphasize the importance of
accounting for spatial structure and bone-embedded osteocytes when modeling the
process of bone remodeling. Thanks to the lattice-based framework, the proposed
model can easily be coupled to a mechanical model of bone loading.

  Assessment of Visceral Leishmaniasis Dynamics in Resource Limited Settings"	"  Neglected tropical diseases (NTD), particularly vector-borne diseases (VBD),
account for a large proportion of the global disease burden, and their control
faces several challenges including diminishing human and financial resources
for those distressed from such diseases. Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), the
second-largest parasitic killer in the world (after malaria) affects poor
populations in endemic countries and causes considerable cost to the affected
individuals and their society. Mathematical models can serve as a critical tool
for understanding the driving mechanisms of a NTD such as VL. The WHO promotes
integrated control programs for VL but this policy is not well supported by
systematic quantitative and dynamic evidence and so potential benefits of the
policy are limited. Moreover, mathematical models can be readily developed and
used to understand the functioning of the VL system cheaply and systematically.
The focus of this research is three-fold: (i) to identify non-traditional but
critical mechanisms for ongoing VL transmission in resource limited regions,
(ii) to review mathematical models used for other infectious diseases that have
the potential to capture identified factors of VL, and (iii) to suggest novel
quantitative models for understanding VL dynamics and for evaluating control
programs in such frameworks for achieveing VL elimination goals.

  Analysis on fMRI images"	"  A universal unanswered question in neuroscience and machine learning is
whether computers can decode the patterns of the human brain. Multi-Voxels
Pattern Analysis (MVPA) is a critical tool for addressing this question.
However, there are two challenges in the previous MVPA methods, which include
decreasing sparsity and noises in the extracted features and increasing the
performance of prediction. In overcoming mentioned challenges, this paper
proposes Anatomical Pattern Analysis (APA) for decoding visual stimuli in the
human brain. This framework develops a novel anatomical feature extraction
method and a new imbalance AdaBoost algorithm for binary classification.
Further, it utilizes an Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) method for
multi-class prediction. APA can automatically detect active regions for each
category of the visual stimuli. Moreover, it enables us to combine homogeneous
datasets for applying advanced classification. Experimental studies on 4 visual
categories (words, consonants, objects and scrambled photos) demonstrate that
the proposed approach achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods.

1609.00959	q-bio	q-bio.GN	"Selecting between-sample RNA-Seq normalization methods from the
  perspective of their assumptions"	"  RNA-Seq is a widely-used method for studying the behavior of genes under
different biological conditions. An essential step in an RNA-Seq study is
normalization, in which raw data are adjusted to account for factors that
prevent direct comparison of expression measures. Errors in normalization can
have a significant impact on downstream analysis, such as inflated false
positives in differential expression analysis. An under-emphasized feature of
normalization is the assumptions upon which the methods rely and how the
validity of these assumptions can have a substantial impact on the performance
of the methods. In this paper, we explain how assumptions provide the link
between raw RNA-Seq read counts and meaningful measures of gene expression. We
examine normalization methods from the perspective of their assumptions, as an
understanding of methodological assumptions is necessary for choosing methods
appropriate for the data at hand. Furthermore, we discuss why normalization
methods perform poorly when their assumptions are violated and how this causes
problems in subsequent analysis. To analyze a biological experiment,
researchers must select a normalization method with assumptions that are met
and that produces a meaningful measure of expression for the given experiment.

1609.01015	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"The Energy Landscape Underpinning Module Dynamics in the Human Brain
  Connectome"	"  Human brain dynamics can be profitably viewed through the lens of statistical
mechanics, where neurophysiological activity evolves around and between local
attractors representing preferred mental states. Many physically-inspired
models of these dynamics define the state of the brain based on instantaneous
measurements of regional activity. Yet, recent work in network neuroscience has
provided initial evidence that the brain might also be well-characterized by
time-varying states composed of locally coherent activity or functional
modules. Here we study this network-based notion of brain state to understand
how functional modules dynamically interact with one another to perform
cognitive functions. We estimate the functional relationships between regions
of interest (ROIs) by fitting a pair-wise maximum entropy model to each ROI's
pattern of allegiance to functional modules. Local minima in this model
represent attractor states characterized by specific patterns of modular
structure. The clustering of local minima highlights three classes of ROIs with
similar patterns of allegiance to community states. Visual, attention,
sensorimotor, and subcortical ROIs tend to form a single functional community.
The remaining ROIs tend to form a putative executive control community or a
putative default mode and salience community. We simulate the brain's dynamic
transitions between these community states using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
random walk. We observe that simulated transition probabilities between basins
resemble empirically observed transitions between community allegiance states
in resting state fMRI data. These results collectively offer a view of the
brain as a dynamical system that transitions between basins of attraction
characterized by coherent activity in small groups of brain regions, and that
the strength of these attractors depends on the cognitive computations being
performed.

past few years, mainly due to improvements in the hardware of the microscopes.
Yet, one of the key open challenges of the field remains the processing of
heterogeneous data sets, produced from samples containing particles at several
different conformational states. For such data sets, one must first classify
their images into homogeneous groups, where each group corresponds to the same
underlying structure, followed by reconstruction of a three-dimensional model
from each of the homogeneous groups. This task has been proven to be extremely
difficult. In this paper we present an iterative algorithm for processing
heterogeneous data sets that combines the classification and reconstruction
steps. We prove accuracy and stability bounds on the algorithm, and demonstrate
it on simulated as well as experimental data sets.

  Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible Epidemic Spreading"	"  The epidemic spreading has been studied for years by applying the mean-field
approach in both homogeneous case, where each node may get infected by an
infected neighbor with the same rate, and heterogeneous case, where the
infection rates between different pairs of nodes are different. Researchers
have discussed whether the mean-field approaches could accurately describe the
epidemic spreading for the homogeneous cases but not for the heterogeneous
cases. In this paper, we explore under what conditions the mean-field approach
could perform well when the infection rates are heterogeneous. In particular,
we employ the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model and compare the
average fraction of infected nodes in the metastable state obtained by the
continuous-time simulation and the mean-field approximation. We concentrate on
an individual-based mean-field approximation called the N-intertwined Mean
Field Approximation (NIMFA), which is an advanced approach considered the
underlying network topology. Moreover, we consider not only the independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) infection rate but also the infection rate
correlated with the degree of the two end nodes. We conclude that NIMFA is
generally more accurate when the prevalence of the epidemic is higher. Given
the same effective infection rate, NIMFA is less accurate when the variance of
the i.i.d.\ infection rate or the correlation between the infection rate and
the nodal degree leads to a lower prevalence. Moreover, given the same actual
prevalence, NIMFA performs better in the cases: 1) when the variance of the
i.i.d.\ infection rates is smaller (while the average is unchanged); 2) when
the correlation between the infection rate and the nodal degree is positive.

tissue trauma is an acute inflammatory response. The magnitude of such a
response is of critical importance, since an uncontrolled response can cause
further tissue damage, sepsis, and ultimately death, while an insufficient
response can result in inadequate clearance of pathogens. A normal inflammatory
response helps to annihilate threats posed by microbial pathogenic ligands,
such as endotoxins, and thus, restore the body to a healthy state. Using a
personalized mathematical model, comprehension and a detailed description of
the interactions between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines can provide
important insight in the evaluation of a patient with sepsis or a susceptible
patient in surgery. Our model is calibrated to experimental data obtained from
experiments measuring pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor
necrosis factor (TNF-), and chemokine ligand-8 (CXCL8)) and the
anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) over 8 hours in 20 healthy
young male subjects, given a low dose intravenous injection of

Through the calibration process, we created a personalized mathematical model

1609.01664	q-bio	q-bio.GN stat.ME	Assessment of P-value variability in the current replicability crisis	"  Increased availability of data and accessibility of computational tools in
recent years have created unprecedented opportunities for scientific research
driven by statistical analysis. Inherent limitations of statistics impose
constrains on reliability of conclusions drawn from data but misuse of
statistical methods is a growing concern. Significance, hypothesis testing and
the accompanying P-values are being scrutinized as representing most widely
applied and abused practices. One line of critique is that P-values are
inherently unfit to fulfill their ostensible role as measures of scientific
hypothesis's credibility. It has also been suggested that while P-values may
have their role as summary measures of effect, researchers underappreciate the
degree of randomness in the P-value. High variability of P-values would suggest
that having obtained a small P-value in one study, one is, nevertheless, likely
to obtain a much larger P-value in a similarly powered replication study. Thus,
""replicability of P-value"" is itself questionable. To characterize P-value
variability one can use prediction intervals whose endpoints reflect the likely
spread of P-values that could have been obtained by a replication study.
Unfortunately, the intervals currently in use, the P-intervals, are based on
unrealistic implicit assumptions. Namely, P-intervals are constructed with the
assumptions that imply substantial chances of encountering large values of
effect size in an observational study, which leads to bias. As an alternative
to P-intervals, we develop a method that gives researchers flexibility by
providing them with the means to control these assumptions. Unlike endpoints of
P-intervals, endpoints of our intervals are directly interpreted as
probabilistic bounds for replication P-values and are resistant to selection
bias contingent upon approximate prior knowledge of the effect size
distribution.

1609.01788	q-bio	q-bio.GN stat.ME	"The more you test, the more you find: Smallest P-values become
  increasingly enriched with real findings as more tests are conducted"	"  Increasing accessibility of data to researchers makes it possible to conduct
massive amounts of statistical testing. Rather than follow a carefully crafted
set of scientific hypotheses with statistical analysis, researchers can now
test many possible relations and let P-values or other statistical summaries
generate hypotheses for them. Genetic epidemiology field is an illustrative
case in this paradigm shift. Driven by technological advances, testing a
handful of genetic variants in relation to a health outcome has been abandoned
in favor of agnostic screening of the entire genome, followed by selection of
top hits, e.g., by selection of genetic variants with the smallest association
P-values. At the same time, nearly total lack of replication of claimed
associations that has been shaming the field turned to a flow of reports whose
findings have been robustly replicating. Researchers may have adopted better
statistical practices by learning from past failures, but we suggest that a
steep increase in the amount of statistical testing itself is an important
factor. Regardless of whether statistical significance has been reached, an
increased number of tested hypotheses leads to enrichment of smallest P-values
with genuine associations. In this study, we quantify how the expected
proportion of genuine signals (EPGS) among top hits changes with an increasing
number of tests. When the rate of occurrence of genuine signals does not
decrease too sharply to zero as more tests are performed, the smallest P-values
are increasingly more likely to represent genuine associations in studies with
more tests.

1609.01790	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Brain Network Architecture: Implications for Human Learning	"  Human learning is a complex phenomenon that requires adaptive processes
across a range of temporal and spacial scales. While our understanding of those
processes at single scales has increased exponentially over the last few years,
a mechanistic understanding of the entire phenomenon has remained elusive. We
propose that progress has been stymied by the lack of a quantitative framework
that can account for the full range of neurophysiological and behavioral
dynamics both across scales in the systems and also across different types of
learning. We posit that network neuroscience offers promise in meeting this
challenge. Built on the mathematical fields of complex systems science and
graph theory, network neuroscience embraces the interconnected and hierarchical
nature of human learning, offering insights into the emergent properties of
adaptability. In this review, we discuss the utility of network neuroscience as
a tool to build a quantitative framework in which to study human learning,
which seeks to explain the full chain of events in the brain from sensory input
to motor output, being both biologically plausible and able to make predictions
about how an intervention at a single level of the chain may cause alterations
in another level of the chain. We close by laying out important remaining
challenges in network neuroscience in explicitly bridging spatial scales at
which neurophysiological processes occur, and underscore the utility of such a
quantitative framework for education and therapy.

  Pairwise Alignment of RNA Secondary Structures with Coaxial Helical Stacking"	"  RNA junctions are important structural elements of RNA molecules. They are
formed when three or more helices come together in three-dimensional space.
Recent studies have focused on the annotation and prediction of coaxial helical
stacking (CHS) motifs within junctions. Here we exploit such predictions to
develop an efficient alignment tool to handle RNA secondary structures with CHS
motifs. Specifically, we build upon our Junction-Explorer software for
predicting coaxial stacking and RNAJAG for modelling junction topologies as
tree graphs to incorporate constrained tree matching and dynamic programming
algorithms into a new method, called CHSalign, for aligning the secondary
structures of RNA molecules containing CHS motifs. Thus, CHSalign is intended
to be an efficient alignment tool for RNAs containing similar junctions.
Experimental results based on thousands of alignments demonstrate that CHSalign
can align two RNA secondary structures containing CHS motifs more accurately
than other RNA secondary structure alignment tools. CHSalign yields a high
score when aligning two RNA secondary structures with similar CHS motifs or
helical arrangement patterns, and a low score otherwise. This new method has
been implemented in a web server, and the program is also made freely
available, at http://bioinformatics.njit.edu/CHSalign/.

1609.02049	q-bio	q-bio.QM	Classification of syncope through data analytics	"  Objective: Syncope is a sudden loss of consciousness with loss of postural
tone and spontaneous recovery; it is a common condition, albeit one that is
challenging to accurately diagnose. Uncertainties about the triggering
mechanisms and their underlying pathophysiology have led to various
classifications of patients exhibiting this symptom. This study presents a new
way to classify syncope types using machine learning. Method: we hypothesize
that syncope types can be characterized by analyzing blood pressure and heart
rate time series data obtained from the head-up tilt test procedure. By
optimizing classification rates, we identify a small number of determining
markers which enable data clustering. Results: We apply the proposed method to
clinical data from 157 subjects; each subject was identified by an expert as
being either healthy or suffering from one of three conditions:
cardioinhibitory syncope, vasodepressor syncope and postural orthostatic
tachycardia. Clustering confirms the three disease groups and identifies two
distinct subgroups within the healthy controls. Conclusion: The proposed method
provides evidence to question current syncope classifications; it also offers
means to refine them. Significance: Current syncope classifications are not
based on pathophysiology and have not led to significant improvements in
patient care. It is expected that a more faithful classification will
facilitate our understanding of the autonomic system for healthy subjects,
which is essential in analyzing pathophysiology of the disease groups.

  Signals with Applications"	"  In this work we have proposed a rigorous mathematical definition for the one
dimensional time domain electrophysiological signals and established its
relationship with two of the three Dirichlet's conditions. We have argues that
any such signal can be represented as the trajectory of a particle moving in a
force field with one degree of freedom. At point on the trajectory, that is, on
the signal, the kinetic energy dissipated by the particle embeds semantic
information into the trajectory or the signal in terms of giving its shape. We
have shown that the rate of kinetic energy dissipation operator or the power
operator P is of importance in shape analysis of the signal by considering its
sign changes. Operating the P-operator on digital signals we have
mathematically proved that its sign change can induce 13 different shapes to a
three successive point configuration. In other words, semantic information at
each point in a digital signal can be embedded by a syllable of 13 different
letters. We have shown some preliminary applications.

  after left hemispheric stroke"	"  Damage to the white matter underlying the left posterior temporal lobe leads
to deficits in multiple language functions. The posterior temporal white matter
may correspond to a bottleneck where both dorsal and ventral language pathways
are vulnerable to simultaneous damage. Damage to a second putative white matter
bottleneck in the left deep prefrontal white matter involving projections
associated with ventral language pathways and thalamo-cortical projections has
recently been proposed as a source of semantic deficits after stroke. However,
the effects of damage to a priori identified white matter bottlenecks on
language function have not been directly investigated. Here, we first used
white matter atlases to identify the previously described white matter
bottlenecks in the posterior temporal and deep prefrontal white matter. We then
assessed the effects of damage to each region on measures of category fluency,
picture naming, and auditory semantic decision-making in 43 patients with
chronic aphasia. Damage to the posterior temporal bottleneck predicted deficits
on all language measures, while damage to the anterior bottleneck only
predicted deficits in category fluency. Importantly, the effects of damage to
the bottleneck regions were not attributable to lesion volume, lesion loads on
the tracts traversing the bottlenecks, or damage to nearby cortical language
areas. Multivariate lesion-symptom mapping and fiber tracking analyses
corroborated these findings. Together, our results provide strong support for
the proposal that spatially specific white matter damage affecting white matter
bottlenecks, particularly in the posterior temporal lobe, contribute to chronic
language deficits after left hemispheric stroke. Our results suggest that
damage to this area is likely to simultaneously disrupt signaling via the
simultaneous disruption of dorsal and ventral language processing streams.

belonging to suitable subsets of the quartets, with the same third nucleotide.
A correlation is pointed out between amino acids belonging to subsets of the

1609.02202	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Deconstructing Odorant Identity via Primacy in Dual Networks	"  In the olfactory system, odor percepts retain their identity despite
substantial variations in concentration, timing, and background. We propose a
novel strategy for encoding intensity-invariant stimuli identity that is based
on representing relative rather than absolute values of the stimulus features.
Because, in this scheme, stimulus identity depends on relative amplitudes of
stimulus features, identity becomes invariant with respect to variations in
intensity and monotonous non-linearities of neuronal responses. In the
olfactory system, stimulus identity can be represented by the identities of the
p strongest responding odorant receptor types out of a species dependent
complement. We show that this information is sufficient to recover sparse
stimuli (odorants) via elastic net loss minimization. Such a minimization has
to be performed under constraints imposed by the relationships between stimulus
features. We map this problem onto the dual problem of minimizing a functional
of Lagrange multipliers. The dual problem, in turn, can be solved by a neural
network whose Lyapunov function represents the dual Lagrangian. We thus propose
that networks in the piriform cortex compute odorant identity and implement
dual computations with the sparse activities of individual neurons representing
the Lagrange multipliers.

learn from their lifetime experience. By contrast, artificial neural networks
trained with backpropagation generally have fixed connection weights that do
not change once training is complete. While recent methods can endow neural
networks with long-term memories, Hebbian plasticity is currently not amenable
to gradient descent. Here we derive analytical expressions for activity
gradients in neural networks with Hebbian plastic connections. Using these
expressions, we can use backpropagation to train not just the baseline weights
of the connections, but also their plasticity. As a result, the networks ""learn
how to learn"" in order to solve the problem at hand: the trained networks
automatically perform fast learning of unpredictable environmental features
during their lifetime, expanding the range of solvable problems. We test the
algorithm on various on-line learning tasks, including pattern completion,
one-shot learning, and reversal learning. The algorithm successfully learns how
to learn the relevant associations from one-shot instruction, and fine-tunes
the temporal dynamics of plasticity to allow for continual learning in response
to changing environmental parameters. We conclude that backpropagation of
Hebbian plasticity offers a powerful model for lifelong learning.

network structure. We report a three-dimensional analysis of the brain network
of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster by synchrotron-radiation tomographic
microscopy. A skeletonized wire model of the left half of the brain network was
built by tracing the three-dimensional distribution of X-ray absorption
coefficients. The obtained models of neuronal processes were classified into
groups on the basis of their three-dimensional structures. These classified
groups correspond to neuronal tracts that send long-range projections or
repeated structures of the optic lobe. The skeletonized model is also composed
of neuronal processes that could not be classified into the groups. The
distribution of these unclassified structures correlates with the distribution
of contacts between neuronal processes. This suggests that neurons that cannot
be classified into typical structures should play important roles in brain
functions. The quantitative description of the brain network provides a basis
for structural and statistical analyses of the Drosophila brain. The challenge
is to establish a methodology for reconstructing the brain network in a
higher-resolution image, leading to a comprehensive understanding of the brain
structure.

  Alternative Factor Analytic Strategy"	"  Purpose: Factor analysis (FA) has become part and parcel in metabolic
syndrome (MBS) research. Both exploration- and confirmation-driven factor
analyzes are rampant. However, factor analytic results on MBS differ widely. A
situation that is at least in part attributable to misapplication of FA. Here,
our purpose is (i) to review factor analytic efforts in the study of MBS with
emphasis on misusage of the FA model and (ii) to propose an alternative factor
analytic strategy.
  Methods: The proposed factor analytic strategy consists of four steps and
confronts weaknesses in application of the FA model. At its heart lies the
explicit separation of dimensionality and pattern selection as well as the
direct evaluation of competing inequality-constrained loading patterns. A
high-profile MBS data set with anthropometric measurements on overweight
children and adolescents is reanalyzed using this strategy.
  Results: The reanalysis implied a more parsimonious constellation of
pathophysiological domains underlying phenotypic expressions of MBS than the
original analysis (and many other analyzes). The results emphasize correlated
factors of impaired glucose metabolism and impaired lipid metabolism.
  Conclusions: Pathophysiological domains underlying phenotypic expressions of
MBS included in the analysis are driven by multiple interrelated metabolic
impairments. These findings indirectly point to the possible existence of a
multifactorial aetiology.

  Thermodynamic Function"	"  Almost all processes -- highly correlated, weakly correlated, or correlated
not at all---exhibit statistical fluctuations. Often physical laws, such as the
Second Law of Thermodynamics, address only typical realizations -- as
highlighted by Shannon's asymptotic equipartition property and as entailed by
taking the thermodynamic limit of an infinite number of degrees of freedom.
Indeed, our interpretations of the functioning of macroscopic thermodynamic
cycles are so focused. Using a recently derived Second Law for information
processing, we show that different subsets of fluctuations lead to distinct
thermodynamic functioning in Maxwellian Demons. For example, while typical
realizations may operate as an engine -- converting thermal fluctuations to
useful work -- even ""nearby"" fluctuations (nontypical, but probable
realizations) behave differently, as Landauer erasers -- converting available
stored energy to dissipate stored information. One concludes that ascribing a
single, unique functional modality to a thermodynamic system, especially one on
the nanoscale, is at best misleading, likely masking an array of simultaneous,
parallel thermodynamic transformations. This alters how we conceive of cellular
processes, engineering design, and evolutionary adaptation.

  patterns"	"  The baroreceptor neurons serve as the primary transducers of blood pressure
for the autonomic nervous system and are thus critical in enabling the body to
respond effectively to changes in blood pressure. These neurons can be
separated into two types (A and C) based on the myelination of their axons and
their distinct firing patterns elicited in response to specific pressure
stimuli. This study has developed a comprehensive model of the afferent
baroreceptor discharge built on physiological knowledge of arterial wall
mechanics, firing rate responses to controlled pressure stimuli, and ion
channel dynamics within the baroreceptor neurons. With this model, we were able
to predict firing rates observed in previously published experiments in both A-
and C-type neurons. These results were obtained by adjusting model parameters
determining the maximal ion-channel conductances. The observed variation in the
model parameters are hypothesized to correspond to physiological differences
between A- and C-type neurons. In agreement with published experimental
observations, our simulations suggest that a twofold lower potassium
conductance in C-type neurons is responsible for the observed sustained basal
firing, whereas a tenfold higher mechanosensitive conductance is responsible
for the greater firing rate observed in A-type neurons. A better understanding
of the difference between the two neuron types can potentially be used to gain
more insight into the underlying pathophysiology facilitating development of
targeted interventions improving baroreflex function in diseased individuals,
e.g. in patients with autonomic failure, a syndrome that is difficult to
diagnose in terms of its pathophysiology.

analyze the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network. The indispensable nodes,
which their removal increase the number of driver nodes to control the network,
are found essential in PPI network. However, the PPI network is far from
complete and there may exist many false-positive or false-negative
interactions, which promotes us to question: are these indispensable nodes
robust to structural change? Here we systematically investigate the robustness
of indispensable nodes of PPI network by removing and adding possible
interactions. We found that the indispensable nodes are sensitive to the
structural change and very few edges can change the type of many indispensable
nodes. The finding may promote our understanding to the control principle of

potential applications especially in medical science. The spherical
Nanodiamonds (NDs) are becoming popular because of their lesser toxicity,
desirable mechanical, optical properties, functionality and available surface
areas. On other hand RNAs are stable, flexible and easy to bind to the NDs. In
this work, we have studied the tRNA dynamics on ND surface by high-resolution
quasi-elastic neutron scattering spectroscopy and all atom molecular dynamics
simulation technique to understand how the tRNA motion is affected by the
presence of ND. The flexibly of the tRNA is analyzed by the Mean square
displacement analysis that shows tRNA have a sharp increase around 230K in its
hydrated form. The intermediate scattering function (ISF) representing the tRNA
dynamics follows the logarithmic decay as proposed by the Mode Coupling theory
(MCT). But most importantly the tRNA dynamics is found to be faster in presence
of ND within 220K to 310K compared to the freestanding ones. This is as we have
shown, is because of the swollen RNA molecule due the introduction of
hydrophilic ND surface.

  species-rich ecosystems"	"  Over the last few decades, ecologists have come to appreciate that key
ecological patterns, which describe ecological communities at relatively large
spatial scales, are not only scale dependent, but also intimately intertwined.
The relative abundance of species, which informs us about the commonness and
rarity of species, changes its shape from small to large spatial scales. The
average number of species as a function of area has a steep initial increase,
followed by decreasing slopes at large scales. Finally, if we find a species in
a given location, it is more likely we find an individual of the same species
close-by, rather than farther apart. Such spatial turnover depends on the
geographical distribution of species, which often are spatially aggregated.
This reverberates on the abundances as well as the richness of species within a
region, but so far it has been difficult to quantify such relationships. Within
a neutral framework, which considers all individuals competitively equivalent,
we introduce a spatial stochastic model, which phenomenologically accounts for
birth, death, immigration and local dispersal of individuals. We calculate the
pair correlation function, which encapsulates spatial turnover, and the
conditional probability to find a species with a certain population within a
given circular area. Also, we calculate the macro-ecological patterns, which we
have referred to above, and compare the analytical formul{\ae} with the
numerical integration of the model. Finally, we contrast the model predictions
with the empirical data for two lowland tropical forest inventories, showing
always a good agreement.

well established biological interaction models we detect and classify the

by incorporating genetic-interactions-profile (GI-profile) data to further
enhance the detection performance. In addition, we propose a sequential

statistically stressable results for real measurement data. Finally, we show

fetal electrocardiogram (ECG) from a single-lead maternal abdominal ECG, we
face both challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel method to extract the
fetal ECG signal from the single channel maternal abdominal ECG signal, without
any additional measurement. The algorithm is composed of three main
ingredients. First, the maternal and fetal heart rates are estimated by the
de-shape short time Fourier transform, which is a recently proposed nonlinear
time-frequency analysis technique; second, the beat tracking technique is
applied to accurately obtain the maternal and fetal R peaks; third, the
maternal and fetal ECG waveforms are established by the nonlocal median. The
algorithm is evaluated on a simulated fetal ECG signal database ({\em fecgsyn}
database), and tested on two real databases with the annotation provided by
experts ({\em adfecgdb} database and {\em CinC2013} database). In general, the
algorithm could be applied to solve other detection and source separation
problems, and reconstruct the time-varying wave-shape function of each

1609.03073	q-bio	q-bio.GN	"BAUM: A DNA Assembler by Adaptive Unique Mapping and Local
  Overlap-Layout-Consensus"	"  Genome assembly from the high-throughput sequencing (HTS) reads is a
fundamental yet challenging computational problem. An intrinsic challenge is
the uncertainty caused by the widespread repetitive elements. Here we get
around the uncertainty using the notion of uniquely mapped (UM) reads, which
motivated the design of a new assembler BAUM. It mainly consists of two types
of iterations. The first type of iterations constructs initial contigs from a
reference, say a genome of a species that could be quite distant, by adaptive
read mapping, filtration by the reference's unique regions, and reference
updating. A statistical test is proposed to split the layouts at possible
structural variation sites. The second type of iterations includes mapping,
scaffolding/contig-extension, and contig merging. We extend each contig by
locally assembling the reads whose mates are uniquely mapped to an end of the
contig. Instead of the de Bruijn graph method, we take the
overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) paradigm. The OLC is implemented by parallel
computation, and has linear complexity with respect to the number of contigs.
The adjacent extended contigs are merged if their alignment is confirmed by the
adjusted gap distance. Throughout the assembling, the mapping criterion is
selected by probabilistic calculations. These innovations can be used
complementary to the existing de novo assemblers. Applying this novel method to
the assembly of wild rice Oryza longistaminata genome, we achieved much
improved contig N50, 18.8k, compared with other assemblers. The assembly was
further validated by contigs constructed from an independent library of long
454 reads.

fluid inside the brain that can be caused by trauma, stroke, infection, or
tumors. It increases the pressure inside the skull and reduces blood and oxygen
supply. To relieve the intracranial pressure, neurosurgeons remove part of the
skull and allow the swollen brain to bulge outward, a procedure known as
decompressive craniectomy. Decompressive craniectomy has been preformed for
more than a century; yet, its effects on the swollen brain remain poorly
understood. Here we characterize the deformation, strain, and stretch in
bulging brains using the nonlinear field theories of mechanics. Our study shows
that even small swelling volumes of 28 to 56 ml induce maximum principal
strains in excess of 30%. For radially outward-pointing axons, we observe
maximal normal stretches of 1.3 deep inside the bulge and maximal tangential
stretches of 1.3 around the craniectomy edge. While the stretch magnitude
varies with opening site and swelling region, our study suggests that the
locations of maximum stretch are universally shared amongst all bulging brains.
Our model can inform neurosurgeons and rationalize the shape and position of
the skull opening, with the overall goal to reduce brain damage and improve the
structural and functional outcomes of decompressive craniectomy in trauma

1609.03224	q-bio	cs.HC q-bio.NC	Bio-Inspired Filter Banks for SSVEP-based Brain-Computer Interfaces	"  Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have the potential to play a vital role in
future healthcare technologies by providing an alternative way of communication
and control. More specifically, steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)
based BCIs have the advantage of higher accuracy and higher information
transfer rate (ITR). In order to fully exploit the capabilities of such
devices, it is necessary to understand the features of SSVEP and design the
system considering its biological characteristics. This paper introduces
bio-inspired filter banks (BIFB) for a novel SSVEP frequency detection method.
It is known that SSVEP response to a flickering visual stimulus is frequency
selective and gets weaker as the frequency of the stimuli increases. In the
proposed approach, the gain and bandwidth of the filters are designed and tuned
based on these characteristics while also incorporating harmonic SSVEP
responses. This method not only improves the accuracy but also increases the
available number of commands by allowing the use of stimuli frequencies elicit
weak SSVEP responses. The BIFB method achieved reliable performance when tested
on datasets available online and compared with two well-known SSVEP frequency
detection methods, power spectral density analysis (PSDA) and canonical
correlation analysis (CCA). The results show the potential of bio-inspired
design which will be extended to include further SSVEP characteristic (e.g.
time-domain waveform) for future SSVEP based BCIs.

  Energies"	"  This paper applies the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) statistical ensemble
technique to estimate small molecule solvation free energies. There is a wide
range of methods available for predicting solvation free energies, ranging from
empirical statistical models to ab initio quantum mechanical approaches. Each
of these methods is based on a set of conceptual assumptions that can affect
predictive accuracy and transferability. Using an iterative statistical
process, we have selected and combined solvation energy estimates using an
ensemble of 17 diverse methods from the fourth Statistical Assessment of
Modeling of Proteins and Ligands (SAMPL) blind prediction study to form a
single, aggregated solvation energy estimate. The ensemble design process
evaluates the statistical information in each individual method as well as the
performance of the aggregate estimate obtained from the ensemble as a whole.
Methods that possess minimal or redundant information are pruned from the
ensemble and the evaluation process repeats until aggregate predictive
performance can no longer be improved. We show that this process results in a
final aggregate estimate that outperforms all individual methods by reducing
estimate errors by as much as 91% to 1.2 kcal/mol accuracy. We also compare our
iterative refinement approach to other statistical ensemble approaches and
demonstrate that this iterative process reduces estimate errors by as much as
61%. This work provides a new approach for accurate solvation free energy
prediction and lays the foundation for future work on aggregate models that can
balance computational cost with prediction accuracy.

  their disease associations"	"  While most studies emphasize on certain aspects of Pathogen-Host Interactions
(PHI), such as the preferential attachment of bacteria or virus to its human
receptor homolog, studies have attempted to methodically classify interactions
among pathogenic proteins and their host proteins. Here we have analyzed 182
pathogens from The Pathogen-Host Interaction Search Tool (PHISTO) and could
identify the proteins/protein coding genes that act on both virus and bacteria.
Importantly there were few proteins viz. P53 (Tumor protein p53), NFKB1
(Nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1), GBLP
(Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-2-like-1), TOX4 (TOX high
mobility group box family member 4), PDIA1 (Protein disulfide-isomerase
precursor), MHY9 (Myosin 9), RAC1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1),
CCAR2 (Cell cycle and apoptosis regulator protein 2) and ILF3 (Interleukin
enhancer binding factor 3) that were more susceptible to both bacterial and
viral pathogens. Identification of such important interacting proteins (IIPs)
can elicit significant insights for better understanding the molecular
mechanisms of such pathogens that interact with the human host.

  Differential Microstructural Basis and Functional Implications and Contribute
  to Individual Identification"	"  Human brain structural networks contain sets of centrally embedded hub
regions that enable efficient information communication. However, it remains
largely unknown about categories of structural brain hubs and their
microstructural, functional and cognitive characteristics as well as
contributions to individual identification. Here, we employed three multi-modal
imaging data sets with structural MRI, diffusion MRI and resting-state
functional MRI to construct individual structural brain networks, identify
brain hubs based on eight commonly used graph-nodal metrics, and perform
comprehensive validation analysis. We found three categories of structural hubs
in the brain networks, namely, aggregated, distributed and connector hubs.
Spatially, these distinct categories of hubs were primarily located in the
default-mode system and additionally in the visual and limbic systems for
aggregated hubs, in the frontoparietal system for distributed hubs, and in the
sensorimotor and ventral attention systems for connector hubs. Importantly,
these three categories of hubs exhibited various distinct characteristics, with
the highest level of microstructural organization in the aggregated hubs, the
largest wiring cost and topological vulnerability in the distributed hubs, and
the highest functional associations and cognitive flexibility in the connector
hubs, although they behaved better regarding these characteristics compared to
non-hubs. Finally, all three categories of hub indices displayed high
across-session spatial similarities and acted as a structural fingerprint with
high predictive rates (100%, 100% and 84.2%) for individual identification.
Collectively, our findings highlighted three categories of brain hubs with
differential microstructural, functional and cognitive associations, which may
shed light on the topological mechanisms of the human connectome.

  Approximate Closed-Form Filter"	"  The process of dynamic state estimation (filtering) based on point process
observations is in general intractable. Numerical sampling techniques are often
practically useful, but lead to limited conceptual insight about optimal
encoding/decoding strategies, which are of significant relevance to
Computational Neuroscience. We develop an analytically tractable Bayesian
approximation to optimal filtering based on point process observations, which
allows us to introduce distributional assumptions about sensor properties, that
greatly facilitate the analysis of optimal encoding in situations deviating
from common assumptions of uniform coding. Numerical comparison with particle
filtering demonstrate the quality of the approximation. The analytic framework
leads to insights which are difficult to obtain from numerical algorithms, and
is consistent with biological observations about the distribution of sensory
cells' tuning curve centers.

  coil design parameters"	"  Neural stimulation represents a powerful technique for neural disorder
treatment. This paper deals with optimization of coil design parameters to be
used during stimulation for modulation of neuronal firing to achieve pain
relief. Pain mechanism is briefly introduced and a hierarchical stimulation
model from coil stimulation to neuronal firing is proposed. Electromagnetic
field distribution for circular, figure of 8 and Magnetic resonance coupling
figure of 8 coils are analyzed with respect to the variation of stimulation
parameters such as distance between coils, stimulation frequency, number of
turns and radius of coils. MRC figure of 8 coils were responsible for inducing
the maximum Electric field for same amount of driving current in coils.
Variation of membrane potential, ion channel conductance and neuronal firing
frequency in a pyramidal neuronal model due to magnetic and acoustic
stimulation are studied. The frequency of neuronal firing for cortical neurons
is higher during pain state, compared to no pain state. Lowest neuronal firing
frequency 18 Hz was found for MRC figure of 8 coils, compared to 30 Hz for
circular coils. Therefore, MRC figure of 8 coils are most effective for
modulation of neuronal firing, thereby achieving pain relief in comparison to
other coils considered in this study

minimised by a judiciously chosen restart protocol, which may either be
stochastic or deterministic. Here we study analytically an arbitrary stochastic
search subject to an arbitrary restart protocol, each characterised by a
distribution of waiting times. By a direct enumeration of paths we construct
the joint distribution of completion time and restart number, in a form
amenable to analytical evaluation or quadrature; thereby we optimise the search
over both time and potentially costly restart events. Analysing the effect of a
punctual, i.e. almost deterministic, restart, we demonstrate that the optimal
completion time always increases proportionately with the variance of the
restart distribution; the constant of proportionality depends only on the
search process. We go on to establish simple bounds on the optimal restart
time. Our results are relevant to the analysis and rational design of efficient
and optimal restart protocols.

  motion: long relocations mingled with thorough local exploration"	"  A combined dynamics consisting of Brownian motion and L\'evy flights is
exhibited by a variety of biological systems performing search processes.
Assessing the search reliability of ever locating the target and the search
efficiency of doing so economically of such dynamics thus poses an important
problem. Here we model this dynamics by a one-dimensional fractional
Fokker-Planck equation combining unbiased Brownian motion and L\'evy flights.
By solving this equation both analytically and numerically we show that the
superposition of recurrent Brownian motion and L\'evy flights with stable
exponent $\alpha<1$, by itself implying zero probability of hitting a point on
a line, lead to transient motion with finite probability of hitting any point
on the line. We present results for the exact dependence of the values of both
the search reliability and the search efficiency on the distance between the
starting and target positions as well as the choice of the scaling exponent
$\alpha$ of the L\'evy flight component.

the septin family of proteins in animal cell division and thus extending for
the first time observations from the budding yeast to animal cells. Visualizing
the distribution of specific septins in different Drosophila tissues and, in
particular, in the Drosophila embryo, together with biochemical and mutant
phenotype data, has contributed important advances to our understanding of
animal septin biology, suggesting roles in processes other than in cytokinesis.
Septin localization using immunofluorescence assays has been possible due to
the generation of antibodies against different Drosophila septins. The recent
availability of lines expressing fluorescent protein fusions of specific
septins further promises to facilitate studies on septin dynamics. Here, we
provide protocols for preparing early Drosophila embryos to visualize septins
using immunofluorescence assays and live fluorescence microscopy. The genetic
tractability of the Drosophila embryo together with its amenability to
high-resolution fluorescence microscopy promises to provide novel insights into
animal septin structure and function.

widely used for simulating cellular patterns such as foams or biological
tissues. Despite its realism and generality, the standard Monte Carlo algorithm
used in the scientific literature to evolve this model preserves connectivity
of cells on a limited range of simulation temperature only. We present a new
algorithm in which cell fragmentation is forbidden for all simulation
temperatures. This allows to significantly enhance realism of the simulated
patterns. It also increases the computational efficiency compared with the
standard CPM algorithm even at same simulation temperature, thanks to the time
spared in not doing unrealistic moves. Moreover, our algorithm restores the
detailed balance equation, ensuring that the long-term stage is independent of
the chosen acceptance rate and chosen path in the temperature space.

  TIRF assays of actin-septin filament assembly"	"  Septins are guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that are conserved from fungi
to humans. Septins assemble into heterooligomeric complexes and higher-order
structures with key roles in various cellular functions including cell
migration and division. The mechanisms by which septins assemble and interact
with other cytoskeletal elements like actin remain elusive. A powerful approach
to address this question is by cell-free reconstitution of pu- rified
cytoskeletal proteins combined with fluorescence microscopy. Here, we describe
procedures for the purification of recombinant Drosophila and human septin
hexamers from Escherichia coli and reconstitution of actin-septin coassembly.
These procedures can be used to compare assembly of Drosophila and human
septins and their coassembly with the actin cytoskeleton by total internal
reflection fluorescence microscopy.

1609.03893	q-bio	cs.CE q-bio.NC stat.AP	"Scalable Algorithms for Generating and Analyzing Structural Brain
  Networks with a Varying Number of Nodes"	"  Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exploits the anisotropic diffusion
of water molecules in the brain to enable the estimation of the brain's
anatomical fiber tracts at a relatively high resolution. In particular,
tractographic methods can be used to generate whole-brain anatomical
connectivity matrix where each element provides an estimate of the connectivity
strength between the corresponding voxels. Structural brain networks are built
using the connectivity information and a predefined brain parcellation, where
the nodes of the network represent the brain regions and the edge weights
capture the connectivity strengths between the corresponding brain regions.
This paper introduces a number of novel scalable methods to generate and
analyze structural brain networks with a varying number of nodes. In
particular, we introduce a new parallel algorithm to quickly generate large
scale connectivity-based parcellations for which voxels in a region possess
highly similar connectivity patterns to the rest of the regions. We show that
the corresponding regional structural consistency is always superior to
randomly generated parcellations over a wide range of parcellation sizes.
Corresponding brain networks with a varying number of nodes are analyzed using
standard graph-theorectic measures, as well as, new measures derived from
spectral graph theory. Our results indicate increasingly more statistical power
of brain networks with larger numbers of nodes and the relatively unique shape
of the spectral profile of large brain networks relative to other well-known
networks.

and the cumulative density of awareness caused by media. The sufficient
condition of global asymptotic stability of disease-free equilibrium is
approved. We get the global stability of the epidemic equilibrium and the
existence conditions of Hopf bifurcation. Numerical simulations are presented
to illustrate the analytical results. Finally, we analyze the influence of
parameters on the control of infectious disease by combining the data of H1N1.
By shortening the time of media lag, increasing transmission rate of media and
the implementation rate of the media project, the spread of disease will be
controlled effectively.

equilibrium repeatedly throughout their lives. Much research has been aimed at
understanding the mechanisms of intermittent control in the context of human
balance control. The present paper deals with one of the recent developments in
the theory of human intermittent control, namely, the double-well model of
noise-driven control activation. We demonstrate that the double-well model can

neurone-to-neurone dynamical complex networks. We show how the dynamical

non-binary information processing and thus multiple hypothesis decision making,
even at the very lowest level of the brain's architecture. In turn we build on
these ideas to address the hard problem of consciousness. We discuss how a
proposed ""dual hierarchy model"", made up form of both external perceived,
physical, elements of increasing complexity, and internal mental elements
(experiences), may support a leaning and evolving consciousness. We discuss the
idea that a human brain ought to be able to re-conjure subjective mental
feelings at will and thus these cannot depend on internal nose (chatter) or
internal instability-driven activity. An immediate consequence of this model,
grounded in dynamical systems and non-binary information processing, is that
finite human brains must always be learning or forgetteing and that any
possible subjective internal feeling that may be idealised with a countable
infinity of facets, can never be learned by zombies or automata: though it can
be experienced more and more fully by an evolving brain (yet never in totality,
not even in a lifetime).

1609.04131	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Role of Mobility and Health Disparities on the Transmission Dynamics of
  Tuberculosis"	"  The transmission dynamics of Tuberculosis (TB) involve complex
epidemiological and socio-economical interactions between individuals living in
highly distinct regional conditions. The level of exogenous reinfection and
first time infection rates within high-incidence settings may influence the
impact of control programs on TB prevalence. This study aims at enhancing the
understanding of TB dynamics via the study of scenarios, within {\it
simplified}, two patch, risk-defined environments, in the presence of short
term mobility and variations in reinfection and infection rates. The modeling
framework captures the role of individuals' `daily' dynamics within and between
places of residency, work or business via the proportion of time spent in
residence and as visitors to TB-risk environments (patches). As a result, the
{\it effective population size} of Patch $i$ (home of $i$-residents) at time
$t$ must account for visitors and residents of Patch $i$, at time $t$. The
impact that {\it effective population size} and the distribution of {\it
individuals' residence times} in different patches have on TB transmission and
control are studied using selected scenarios where risk is defined by the
estimated or perceive first time infection and/or exogenous re-infection rates.
Our results suggest that, under certain conditions, allowing infected
individuals to move from high to low TB prevalence areas (for example via the
sharing of treatment and isolation facilities) may lead to a reduction in the
total TB prevalence in the overall, here two-patch, population.

site to site in the genome during the life cycle of a cell, usually encoding
the very enzymes which perform their excision. However, some transposons are
parasitic, relying on the enzymes produced by the regular transposons. In this
case, we show that a stochastic model, which takes into account the small copy
numbers of the transposons in a cell, predicts noise-induced predator-prey
oscillations with a characteristic time scale that is much longer than the cell
replication time, indicating that the state of the predator-prey oscillator is
stored in the genome and transmitted to successive generations. Our work
demonstrates the important role of number fluctuations in the expression of
mobile genetic elements, and shows explicitly how ecological concepts can be
applied to the dynamics and fluctuations of living genomes.

a network in which connection probabilities are symmetric in pairs, $P_{ij} =

are inherently linked; an overabundance of reciprocally connected pairs emerges
necessarily when the network structure deviates from a random network in any

and flexibility formulations. The structure of the classic Gaussian surface is
utilized to construct a new type of rigidity index, which leads to a new class
of rigidity densities with the classic Gaussian surface as a special case.
Additionally, we introduce a new type of flexibility index based on the domain
indicator property of normalized rigidity density. These generalized FRI (gFRI)
methods have been extensively validated by the B-factor predictions of 364
proteins. Significantly outperforming the classic Gaussian network model (GNM),
gFRI is a new generation of methodologies for accurate, robust and efficient
analysis of protein flexibility and fluctuation. Finally, gFRI based molecular
surface generation and flexibility visualization are demonstrated.

become the most serious threat to worldwide apiculture. In the model presented
here we extend the bee population dynamics with mite viral epidemiology
examined in an earlier paper by allowing a bee-dependent mite population size.
The results of the analysis match field observations well and give a clear
explanation of how Varroa affects the epidemiology of certain naturally
occurring bee viruses, causing considerable damages to colonies. The model
allows only four possible stable equilibria, using known field parameters. The
first one contains only the thriving healthy bees. Here the disease is
eradicated and also the mites are wiped out. Alternatively, we find the
equilibrium still with no mite population, but with endemic disease among the
thriving bee population. Thirdly, infected bees coexist with the mites in the
Varroa invasion scenario; in this situation the disease invades the hive,
driving the healthy bees to extinction and therefore affecting all the bees.
Coexistence is also possible, with both populations of bees and mites thriving
and with the disease endemically affecting both species. The analysis is in
line with field observations in natural honey bee colonies. Namely, these
diseases are endemic and if the mite population is present, necessarily the
viral infection occurs. Further, in agreement with the fact that the presence
of Varroa increments the viral transmission, the whole bee population may
become infected when the disease vector is present in the beehive. Also, a low
horizontal transmission rate of the virus among the honey bees will help in
protecting the bee colonies from Varroa infestation and viral epidemics.

  resolution limit"	"  Graph theory provides a powerful framework to investigate brain functional
connectivity networks and their modular organization. However, most graph-based
methods suffer from a fundamental resolution limit that may have affected
previous studies and prevented detection of modules, or communities, that are
smaller than a specific scale. Surprise, a resolution-limit-free function
rooted in discrete probability theory, has been recently introduced and applied
to brain networks, revealing a wide size-distribution of functional modules, in
contrast with many previous reports. However, the use of Surprise is limited to
binary networks, while brain networks are intrinsically weighted, reflecting a
continuous distribution of connectivity strengths between different brain
regions. Here, we propose Asymptotical Surprise, a continuous version of
Surprise, for the study of weighted brain connectivity networks, and validate
this approach in synthetic networks endowed with a ground-truth modular
structure. We compare Asymptotical Surprise with leading community detection
methods currently in use and show its superior sensitivity in the detection of
small modules even in the presence of noise and intersubject variability such
as those observed in fMRI data. Finally, we apply our novel approach to
functional connectivity networks from resting state fMRI experimenta, and
demonstrate a heterogeneous modular organization, with a wide distribution of
clusters spanning multiple scales.

been related to ecosystem properties such as stability and robustness.
Analysing 46 food webs of various kinds, we find that most food webs fall into
one of two distinct motif families. The separation between the families is well
predicted by a global measure of hierarchical order in directed networks -
trophic coherence. We find that trophic coherence is also a good predictor for
the extent of omnivory, defined as the tendency of species to feed on multiple
trophic levels. We compare our results to a network assembly model that admits
tunable trophic coherence via a single free parameter. The model is able to
generate food webs in either of the two families by varying this parameter, and
correctly classifies almost all the food webs in our database. This establishes
a link between global order and local preying patterns in food webs.

  microcircuits"	"  We investigate the synchronization properties between two excitatory coupled
neurons in the presence of an inhibitory loop mediated by an interneuron.
Dynamical inhibition together with noise independently applied to each neuron
provide phase diversity in the dynamics of the neuronal motif. We show that the
interplay between the coupling strengths and external noise controls the phase
relations between the neurons in a counter-intuitive way. For a master-slave
configuration (unidirectional coupling) we find that the slave can anticipate
the master, on average, if the slave is subject to the inhibitory feedback. In
this non-usual regime, called anticipated synchronization (AS), the phase of
the post-synaptic neuron is advanced with respect to that of the pre-synaptic
neuron. We also show that the AS regime survives even in the presence of
unbalanced bidirectional excitatory coupling. Moreover, for the symmetric
mutually coupled situation, the neuron that is subject to the inhibitory loop
leads in phase.

nanoparticles interact with biomembranes. Nanoparticles are wrapped
spontaneously by biomembranes if the adhesive interactions between the

last years, the cooperative wrapping of spherical nanoparticles in membrane
tubules has been observed in experiments and simulations. For spherical
nanoparticles, the stability of the particle-filled membrane tubules strongly
depends on the range of the adhesive particle-membrane interactions. In this
article, we show via modeling and energy minimization that elongated and patchy
particles are wrapped cooperatively in membrane tubules that are highly stable
for all ranges of the particle-membrane interactions, compared to individual
wrapping of the particles. The cooperative wrapping of linear chains of
elongated or patchy particles in membrane tubules may thus provide an efficient

collection of spatially segregated functional networks. It is thought that each
of these networks is in turn composed of a set of distinct sub-regions that
together support each network's function. Considering the sub-regions to be an
essential part of the brain's functional architecture, several strategies have
been put forward that aim at identifying the functional sub-units of the brain
by means of functional parcellations. Current parcellation strategies typically
employ a bottom-up strategy, creating a parcellation by clustering smaller
units. We propose a novel top-down parcellation strategy, using time courses of
instantaneous connectivity to subdivide an initial region of interest into
sub-regions. We use split-half reproducibility to choose the optimal number of
sub-regions. We apply our Instantaneous Connectivity Parcellation (ICP)
strategy on high-quality resting-state FMRI data, and demonstrate the ability
to generate parcellations for thalamus, entorhinal cortex, motor cortex, and
subcortex including brainstem and striatum. We evaluate the subdivisions
against available cytoarchitecture maps to show that the our parcellation
strategy recovers biologically valid subdivisions that adhere to known

selection processes in which information (whether genetic or cultural) is
sieved, retained and then transmitted to the next generation. In both domains
such a process will result in recognizable lineages and tree-like phylogenies
so characteristic of Darwinian evolution. Because a principle of inheritance
(i.e., faithful replication of information) holds in both domains, we may trace
back particular transmission histories and identify the forces that influenced
them. The idea that culture evolves is quite old, but only in recent years
there has been a serious effort to turn this idea into science. This article
offers a concise analysis of how a rudimentary idea gradually evolved into a
thriving research program.

  Canonical Correlation Analysis"	"  Kernel and Multiple Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) are employed
to classify schizophrenic and healthy patients based on their SNPs, DNA
Methylation and fMRI data. Kernel and Multiple Kernel CCA are popular methods
for finding nonlinear correlations between high-dimensional datasets. Data was
gathered from 183 patients, 79 with schizophrenia and 104 healthy controls.
Kernel and Multiple Kernel CCA represent new avenues for studying
schizophrenia, because, to our knowledge, these methods have not been used on
these data before. Classification is performed via k-means clustering on the
kernel matrix outputs of the Kernel and Multiple Kernel CCA algorithm.
Accuracies of the Kernel and Multiple Kernel CCA classification are compared to
that of the regularized linear CCA algorithm classification, and are found to
be significantly more accurate. Both algorithms demonstrate maximal accuracies
when the combination of DNA methylation and fMRI data are used, and experience
lower accuracies when the SNP data are incorporated.

photosynthesis and presents theorems on the existence and stability of steady
states of these models. Results on five-variable models in the literature are
surveyed. Next a number of larger models related to one introduced by
Pettersson and Ryde-Pettersson are discussed. The mathematical nature of this
model is clarified, showing that it is naturally defined as a system of
differential-algebraic equations. It is proved that there are choices of
parameters for which this model admits more than one positive steady state.
This is done by analysing the limit where the storage of sugars from the cycle
as starch is shut down. There is also a discussion of the minimal models for
the cycle due to Hahn.

  with primary prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillators: Systematic
  review and meta-analysis"	"  BACKGROUND: Some but not all prior studies have shown that women receiving a
primary prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) have a lower
risk of death and appropriate shocks than men.
  PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of gender on the risk of appropriate shock,
all-cause mortality and inappropriate shock in contemporary studies of patients
receiving a primary prophylactic ICD.
  DATA SOURCE: PubMed, LIVIVO, Cochrane CENTRAL between 2010 and 2016.
  STUDY SELECTION: Studies providing at least 1 gender-specific risk estimate
for the outcomes of interest.
  DATA EXTRACTION: Abstracts were screened independently for potentially
eligible studies for inclusion. Thereby each abstract was reviewed by at least
two authors.
  DATA SYNTHESIS: Out of 680 abstracts retained by our search strategy, 20
studies including 46'657 patients had gender-specific information on at least
one of the relevant endpoints. Mean age across the individual studies varied
between 58 and 69 years. The proportion of women enrolled ranged from 10% to
30%. Across 6 available studies, women had a significantly lower risk of first
appropriate shock compared with men (pooled multivariable adjusted hazard ratio
0.62 (95% CI [0.44; 0.88]). Across 14 studies reporting multivariable adjusted
gender-specific hazard ratio estimates for all-cause mortality, women had a
lower risk of death than men (pooled hazard ratio 0.75 (95% CI [0.66; 0.86]).
There was no statistically significant difference for the incidence of first
inappropriate shocks (3 studies, pooled hazard ratio 0.99 (95% CI [0.56;
1.73]).
  CONCLUSION: In this large contemporary meta-analysis, women had a
significantly lower risk of appropriate shocks and death than men, but a
similar risk of inappropriate shocks. These data may help to select patients
who benefit from primary prophylactic ICD implantation.

  Microvasculature"	"  In microvascular transport, where both blood and drug carriers are involved,
plasma skimming has a key role on changing hematocrit level and drug carrier
concentration in capillary beds after continuous vessel bifurcation in the
microvasculature. While there have been numerous studies on modeling the plasma
skimming of blood, previous works lacked in consideration of its interaction
with drug carriers. In this paper, a generalized plasma skimming model is
suggested to predict the redistributions of both the cells and drug carriers at
each bifurcation. In order to examine its applicability, this new model was
applied on a single bifurcation system to predict the redistribution of red
blood cells and drug carriers. Furthermore, this model was tested at
microvascular network level under different plasma skimming conditions for
predicting the concentration of drug carriers. Based on these results, the
applicability of this generalized plasma skimming model is fully discussed and
future works along with the model's limitations are summarized.

mother to child transmission, sharing of unsterilized objects that is capable
of making cut or wounds on the body, through blood or bodily fluid
transmission. AIDS has no permanent cure but remedies that help in suppressing
the power effect of the virus are available. Previous studies has shown that
the epidemic claimed more lives via vertical transmission, mother-to-child
transmission, blood transfusion, sexual intercourse and injection drug users.
The associated models were derived using diagnosis and treatments records of
confirmed status of HIV/AIDS clients. A new model analysis were proposed that
could handle cases of HIV/AIDS routes of transmission and treatments via
vertical, mother-to-child, blood transfusion, sexual intercourse, injection
drug users that were not considered in previous studies. The new model was
solved using Fractional Differential Transformation by Caputo sense algorithm.
The new model is a major contribution for optimal assessment, monitoring,

1609.05052	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio.TO	Uncertainty of current understanding regarding OBT formation in plants	"  Radiological impact models are important tools that support nuclear safety.
For tritium, a special radionuclide that readily enters the life cycle, the
processes involved in its transport into the environment are complex and
inadequately understood. For example, tritiated water (HTO) enters plants by
leaf and root uptake and is converted to organically bound tritium (OBT) in
exchangeable and non-exchangeable forms; however, the observed OBT/HTO ratios
in crops exhibit large variability and contradict the current models for
routine releases. Non-routine or spike releases of tritium further complicate
the prediction of OBT formation. The experimental data for a short and intense
atmospheric contamination of wheat are presented together with various models
predictions. The experimental data on wheat demonstrate that the OBT formation
is a long process, it is dependent on receptor location and stack dynamics,
there are differences between night and day releases, and the HTO dynamics in
leaf and ear is a very important contributor to OBT formation.

  prediction"	"  Predicting the 3D structure of a macromolecule, such as a protein or an RNA
molecule, is ranked top among the most difficult and attractive problems in
bioinformatics and computational biology. Its importance comes from the
relationship between the 3D structure and the function of a given protein or
RNA. 3D structures also help to find the ligands of the protein, which are
usually small molecules, a key step in drug design. Unfortunately, there is no
shortcut to accurately obtain the 3D structure of a macromolecule. Many
physical measurements of macromolecular 3D structures cannot scale up, due to
their large labor costs and the requirements for lab conditions.
  In recent years, computational methods have made huge progress due to advance
in computation speed and machine learning methods. These methods only need the
sequence information to predict 3D structures by employing various mathematical
models and machine learning methods. The success of computational methods is
highly dependent on a large database of the proteins and RNA with known
structures.
  However, the performance of computational methods are always expected to be
improved. There are several reasons for this. First, we are facing, and will
continue to face sparseness of data.Secondly, the 3D structure space is too
large for our computational capability.
  The two obstacles can be removed by knowledge-based methods, which combine
knowledge learned from the known structures and biologists' knowledge of the
folding process of protein or RNA. In the dissertation, I will present my
results in building a knowledge-based method by using machine learning methods
to tackle this problem. My methods include the knowledge constraints on
intermediate states, which can highly reduce the solution space of a protein or
RNA, in turn increasing the efficiency of the structure folding method and
improving its accuracy.

  Interstitium"	"  The pressure in the renal interstitium is an important factor for normal
kidney function. Here we develop a computational model of the rat kidney and
use it to investigate the relationship between arterial blood pressure and
interstitial fluid pressure. In addition, we investigate how tissue flexibility
influences this relationship. Due to the complexity of the model, the large
number of parameters, and the inherent uncertainty of the experimental data, we
utilize Monte Carlo sampling to study the model's behavior under a wide range
of parameter values and to compute first- and total-order sensitivity indices.
Characteristically, at elevated arterial blood pressure, the model predicts
cases with increased or reduced interstitial pressure. The transition between
the two cases is controlled mostly by the compliance of the blood vessels
located before the afferent arterioles.

1609.05564	q-bio	stat.ME q-bio.GN stat.AP	Searching for Gene Sets with Mutually Exclusive Mutations	"  Cancer cells evolve through random somatic mutations. ""Beneficial"" mutations
which disrupt key pathways (e.g. cell cycle regulation) are subject to natural
selection. Multiple mutations may lead to the same ""beneficial"" effect, in
which case there is no selective advantage to having more than one of these
mutations. Hence we are interested in finding sets of genes whose mutations are
approximately mutually exclusive (anti-co-occurring) within the TCGA Pancancer
dataset. In principle, finding the best set is NP Hard. Nevertheless, we will
show how a new Mutation anti-co-OCcurrence Algorithm (MOCA) provides an
effective greedy search and testing algorithm with guaranteed control of the
familywise error rate or false discovery rate, by combining some
under-appreciated ideas from frequentist hypothesis testing. These ideas
include: (a) A novel exact conditional test for the tendency of multiple sets
to have a large/small union/intersection, which generalises Fisher's exact test
of 2x2 tables. (b) Randomised hypothesis tests for discrete distributions. (c)
Stouffer's method for combining p-values. (d) Weighted multiple hypothesis
testing. A new approach to setting a-priori weights which generates additional
implicit hypothesis tests is suggested, and allows us to preserve almost all
statistical power when testing pairs despite introducing a combinatorially
large number of additional hypotheses.

  networks"	"  Here we investigate the synchronization of networks of FitzHugh-Nagumo
neurons coupled in scale-free, small-world and random topologies, in the
presence of distributed time delays in the coupling of neurons. We explore how
the synchronization transition is affected when the time delays in the
interactions between pairs of interacting neurons are non-uniform. We find that
the presence of distributed time-delays does not change the behavior of the
synchronization transition significantly, vis-a-vis networks with constant
time-delay, where the value of the constant time-delay is the mean of the
distributed delays. We also notice that a normal distribution of delays gives
rise to a transition at marginally lower coupling strengths, vis-a-vis
uniformly distributed delays. These trends hold across classes of networks and
for varying standard deviations of the delay distribution, indicating the
generality of these results. So we conclude that distributed delays, which may
be typically expected in real-world situations, do not have a notable effect on
synchronization. This allows results obtained with constant delays to remain
relevant even in the case of randomly distributed delays.

  Study on Diabetes Self-care Factors"	"  Due to the chronic nature of diabetes, patient self-care factors play an
important role in any treatment plan. In order to understand the behaviour of
patients in response to medical advice on self-care, clinicians often conduct
cross-sectional surveys. When analysing the survey data, statistical machine
learning methods can potentially provide additional insight into the data
either through deeper understanding of the patterns present or making
information available to clinicians in an intuitive manner. In this study, we
use self-organising maps (SOMs) to visualise the responses of patients who
share similar responses to survey questions, with the goal of helping
clinicians understand how patients are managing their treatment and where
action should be taken. The principle behavioural patterns revealed through
this are that: patients who take the correct dose of insulin also tend to take
their injections at the correct time, patients who eat on time also tend to
correctly manage their food portions and patients who check their blood glucose
with a monitor also tend to adjust their insulin dosage and carry snacks to
counter low blood glucose. The identification of these positive behavioural
patterns can also help to inform treatment by exploiting their negative
corollaries.

  network"	"  We consider self-tolerance and its failure -autoimmunity- in a minimal
mathematical model of the idiotypic network. A node in the network represents a
clone of B-lymphocytes and its antibodies of the same idiotype which is encoded
by a bitstring. The links between nodes represent possible interactions between
clones of almost complementary idiotype. A clone survives only if the number of
populated neighbored nodes is neither too small nor too large. The dynamics is
driven by the influx of lymphocytes with randomly generated idiotype from the
bone marrow. Previous work has revealed that the network evolves towards a
highly organized modular architecture, characterized by groups of nodes which
share statistical properties. The structural properties of the architecture can
be described analytically, the statistical properties determined from
simulations are confirmed by a modular mean-field theory. To model the presence
of self we permanently occupy one or several nodes. These nodes influence their
linked neighbors, the autoreactive clones, but are themselves not affected by
idiotypic interactions. The architecture is very similar to the case without
self, but organized such that the neighbors of self are only weakly occupied,
thus providing self-tolerance. This supports the perspective that self-reactive
clones, which regularly occur in healthy organisms, are controlled by
anti-idiotypic clones. We discuss how perturbations, like an infection with
foreign antigen, a change in the influx of new idiotypes, or the random removal
of idiotypes, may lead to autoreactivity and devise protocols which cause a
reconstitution of the self-tolerant state. The results could be helpful to
understand network and probabilistic aspects of autoimmune disorders.

  Colombia: stratifying the potential transmission of an ongoing epidemic"	"  Introduction: Zika epidemic in America was declared a public health emergency
of international concern after the rapid spread in the region. Stratification
of the potential transmission of the disease is needed to address the efforts
surveillance and disease control. The goal of this research is to compare the
basic reproductive number of Zika in different municipalities, from an SIR
model with implicit vector dynamics, based on the daily case reporting data of
Antioquia, Colombia, the second most affected country after Brazil. Methods: An
simple SIR model with implicit vector dynamics was derived and used. The
approximate solution of the model in terms of individuals recovered in each
time unit, allowed to obtain estimate of the model parameters including the
basic reproduction number (Ro) and its 95% confidence intervals. These
parameters were estimated via fitting the solution of the model to the daily
reported cumulative cases data from the regional surveillance system. Results:
Ro was estimated for 20 municipalities, all located at less than 2200 meters
above sea level. From January to April 2016, between 17 and 347 cases were
reported from these municipalities. Of these, 15 municipalities had a high
potential for transmission (Ro>1) and 5 had less potential (Ro<1), although in
3 of these, transmission was later possible because its upper confidence
interval of Ro was greater than one. Conclusion: Surveillance and control of
Zika should be directed primarily to municipalities with Ro>1. Furthermore,
strategies that will strengthen the detection and management of cases in the
remaining municipalities should be beneficial to the whole Antioquia region.

  influenza virus infection"	"  Myriad experiments have identified an important role for $\rm CD8^+$ T cell
response mechanisms in determining recovery from influenza A virus infection.
Animal models of influenza infection further implicate multiple elements of the
immune response in defining the dynamical characteristics of viral infection.
To date, influenza virus models, while capturing particular aspects of the
natural infection history, have been unable to reproduce the full gamut of
observed viral kinetic behaviour in a single coherent framework. Here, we
introduce a mathematical model of influenza viral dynamics incorporating all
major immune components (innate, humoral and cellular) and explore its
properties with a particular emphasis on the role of cellular immunity.
Calibrated against a range of murine data, our model is capable of
recapitulating observed viral kinetics from a multitude of experiments.
Importantly, the model predicts a robust exponential relationship between the
level of effector $\rm CD8^+$ T cells and recovery time, whereby recovery time
rapidly decreases to a fixed minimum recovery time with an increasing level of
effector $\rm CD8^+$ T cells. We find support for this relationship in recent
clinical data from influenza A(H7N9) hospitalised patients. The exponential
relationship implies that people with a lower level of naive $\rm CD8^+$ T
cells may receive significantly more benefit from induction of additional
effector $\rm CD8^+$ T cells arising from immunological memory, itself
established through either previous viral infection or T cell-based vaccines.

are whether a conformational change occurs prior to a binding event
('conformational selection') or after a binding event ('induced fit'), and how
conformational transition rates can be obtained from experiments. In this
article, we present general results for the chemical relaxation rates of
conformational-selection and induced-fit binding processes that hold for all
concentrations of proteins and ligands and, thus, go beyond the standard
pseudo-first-order approximation of large ligand concentration. These results
allow to distinguish conformational-selection from induced-fit processes - also
in cases in which such a distinction is not possible under pseudo-first-order
conditions - and to extract conformational transition rates of proteins from
chemical relaxation data.

  models"	"  Data used in stock assessment models result from combinations of biological,
ecological, fishery, and sampling processes. Since different types of errors
propagate through these processes it can be difficult to identify a particular
family of distributions for modelling errors on observations a priori. By
implementing several observational likelihoods, modelling both numbers- and
proportions-at-age, in an age based state-space stock assessment model, we
compare the model fit for each choice of likelihood along with the implications
for spawning stock biomass and average fishing mortality. We propose using AIC
intervals based on fitting the full observational model for comparing different
observational likelihoods. Using data from four stocks, we show that the model
fit is improved by modelling the correlation of observations within years.
However, the best choice of observational likelihood differs for different
stocks, and the choice is important for the short-term conclusions drawn from
the assessment model; in particular, the choice can influence total allowable
catch advise based on reference points.

1609.06107	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Stability Analysis of Population Dynamics Model in Microbial Biofilms
  with Non-participating Strains"	"  The existence of phenotypic heterogeneity in single-species bacterial
biofilms is well-established in the published literature. However, the modeling
of population dynamics in biofilms from the viewpoint of social interactions,
i.e. interplay between heterotypic strains, and the analysis of this kind using
control theory are not addressed significantly. Therefore, in this paper, we
theoretically analyze the population dynamics model in microbial biofilms with
non-participating strains (coexisting with public goods producers and
non-producers) in the context of evolutionary game theory and nonlinear
dynamics. Our analysis of the replicator dynamics model is twofold: first
without the inclusion of spatial pattern, and second with the consideration of
degree of assortment. In the first case, Lyapunov stability analysis of the
stable equilibrium point of the proposed replicator system determines (1,0)
('full dominance of cooperators') as a global asymptotic stable equilibrium
whenever the return exceeds the metabolic cost of cooperation. Hence, the
global asymptotic stable nature of (1,0) in the context of non-consideration of
spatial pattern helps to justify mathematically the adversity in the
eradication of ""cooperative enterprise"" that is an infectious biofilm. In the
second case, we found non-existence of global asymptotic stability in the
system, and it unveils two additional phenomena - bistability and coexistence.
In this context, two inequality conditions are derived for the 'full dominance
of cooperators' and coexistence. Therefore, the inclusion of spatial pattern in
biofilms with non-competing strains intends conditional dominance of pathogenic
(with respect to the hosts) public goods producers which can be an effective
strategy towards the control of an infectious biofilm with the drug-dependent
regulation of degree of segregation.

  tree graphical models"	"  Gene expression is a readily-observed quantification of transcriptional
activity and cellular state that enables the recovery of the relationships
between regulators and their target genes. Reconstructing transcriptional
regulatory networks from gene expression data is a problem that has attracted
much attention, but previous work often makes the simplifying (but unrealistic)
assumption that regulator activity is represented by mRNA levels. We use a
latent tree graphical model to analyze gene expression without relying on
transcription factor expression as a proxy for regulator activity. The latent
tree model is a type of Markov random field that includes both observed gene
variables and latent (hidden) variables, which factorize on a Markov tree.
Through efficient unsupervised learning approaches, we determine which groups
of genes are co-regulated by hidden regulators and the activity levels of those
regulators. Post-processing annotates many of these discovered latent variables
as specific transcription factors or groups of transcription factors. Other
latent variables do not necessarily represent physical regulators but instead
reveal hidden structure in the gene expression such as shared biological
function. We apply the latent tree graphical model to a yeast stress response
dataset. In addition to novel predictions, such as condition-specific binding
of the transcription factor Msn4, our model recovers many known aspects of the
yeast regulatory network. These include groups of co-regulated genes,
condition-specific regulator activity, and combinatorial regulation among
transcription factors. The latent tree graphical model is a general approach
for analyzing gene expression data that requires no prior knowledge of which
possible regulators exist, regulator activity, or where transcription factors
physically bind.

Such period life expectancies may be distorted by selection when comparing

a fair comparison between the countries, is to use cohort data and consider the
expected number of years lost before a given age a. Contrary to the results

years than women in Norway and Sweden, while there are no indications that
Japanese women will lose fewer years than Scandinavian women.

  of excitable neurons"	"  The study of balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons has led
to several open questions. On the one hand it is yet unclear whether the
asynchronous state observed in the brain is autonomously generated, or if it
results from the interplay between external drivings and internal dynamics. It
is also not known, which kind of network variabilities will lead to irregular
spiking and which to synchronous firing states. Here we show how isolated
networks of purely excitatory neurons generically show asynchronous firing
whenever a minimal level of structural variability is present together with a
refractory period. Our autonomous networks are composed of excitable units, in
the form of leaky integrators spiking only in response to driving inputs. For a
non-uniform network, composed exclusively of excitatory neurons, we find a rich
repertoire of self-induced dynamical states, including asynchronous drifting
states, fully synchronized, or mixed, containing both drifting and synchronized
components. The individual neurons considered are excitable and hence do not
dispose of intrinsic natural firing frequencies. An effective network-wide
distribution of natural frequencies is however generated autonomously through
self-consistent feedback loops. We find two types of asynchronous activity,
with the individual neurons spiking regularly in the pure drifting state,
albeit with a continuous distribution of firing frequencies. The activity of
the drifting component, however, becomes irregular in the mixed state, due to
the periodic driving of the synchronized component. We propose a new tool for
the study of chaos in spiking neural networks, which consists of an analysis of
the time series of pairs of consecutive interspike intervals. In this space, we
show that a strange attractor with a fractal dimension is formed.

  Prediction and Biomarker Discovery"	"  Molecular profiling data (e.g., gene expression) has been used for clinical
risk prediction and biomarker discovery. However, it is necessary to integrate
other prior knowledge like biological pathways or gene interaction networks to
improve the predictive ability and biological interpretability of biomarkers.
Here, we first introduce a general regularized Logistic Regression (LR)
framework with regularized term $\lambda \|\bm{w}\|_1 +
\eta\bm{w}^T\bm{M}\bm{w}$, which can reduce to different penalties, including
Lasso, elastic net, and network-regularized terms with different $\bm{M}$. This
framework can be easily solved in a unified manner by a cyclic coordinate
descent algorithm which can avoid inverse matrix operation and accelerate the
computing speed. However, if those estimated $\bm{w}_i$ and $\bm{w}_j$ have
opposite signs, then the traditional network-regularized penalty may not
perform well. To address it, we introduce a novel network-regularized sparse LR

  kinetically hot residues"	"  Physical interactions between proteins are often difficult to decipher. The
aim of this paper is to present an algorithm designed to recognize binding
patches and supporting structural scaffolds of interacting heterodimer protein
chains using the Gaussian Network Model (GNM). The recognition is based on the
(self)adjustable identification of kinetically hot residues, i.e., residues
with highest contributions to the weighted sum of fastest modes per chain
extracted via GNM, and their connection to possible binding scaffolds. The
algorithm adjusts the number of modes used in the GNM's weighted sum
calculation using the ratio of predicted and expected numbers of target
residues (contact and first layer residues). This approach produces very good
results when applied to chains forming heterodimers, especially with dimers
with high chain length ratios. The protocol's ability to recognize near native
decoys was compared to the ability of the statistical potential of Lu and
Skolnick using the Sternberg and Vakser decoy dimers sets. The statistical
potential produced better overall results, but in a number of cases its
predicting ability was comparable, or even worse than the ability of the
adjustable GNM approach. The results presented in this paper suggest that in
heterodimers, at least one partnering chain has interacting scaffold determined
by the immovable kinetically hot residues. In many cases interacting chains
(especially if being of noticeably different sizes), either behave as rigid
lock and key, or exhibit opposite dynamic behaviors. While the binding surface
of one of the chains is rigid and stable, its partner's interacting scaffold is
more flexible and adaptable.
  Authors note: The approach described here was initially given as a rough
draft in 2013 [1]. The next manuscript will describe the behavior of protein
dimers incorrectly characterized with the present approach.

  Integration"" [arXiv:1603.07927v1]"	"  The uniqueness issue of SDE decomposition theory proposed by Ao and his
co-workers has recently been discussed. A comprehensive study to investigate
connections among different landscape theories [J. Chem. Phys. 144, 094109
(2016)] has pointed out that the decomposition is generally not unique, while
Ao et al. (arXiv:1603.07927v1) argues that such conclusions are ""incorrect""
because of the missing boundary conditions. In this comment, we will combine
literatures research and concrete examples to show that the concrete and
effective boundary conditions have not been proposed to guarantee the
uniqueness, hence the arguments in [arXiv:1603.07927v1] are not sufficient.
Moreover, we show that the ""uniqueness"" of the O-U process decomposition
referred by YTA paper is unable to serve as a counterexample to ZL's result
since additional assumptions have been made implicitly beyond the original SDE
decomposition framework, which cannot be applied to general nonlinear cases.
Some other issues such as the failure of gradient expansion method will also be
discussed. Our demonstration contributes to better understanding of the
relevant papers as well as the SDE decomposition theory.

1609.06743	q-bio	q-bio.BM	"Protein-protein docking by generalized Fourier transforms on 5D
  rotational manifolds"	"  Energy evaluation using fast Fourier transforms enables sampling billions of
putative complex structures and hence revolutionized rigid protein-protein
docking. However, in current methods efficient acceleration is achieved only in
either the translational or the rotational subspace. Developing an efficient
and accurate docking method that expands FFT based sampling to 5 rotational
coordinates is an extensively studied but still unsolved problem. The algorithm
presented here retains the accuracy of earlier methods but yields at least
tenfold speedup. The improvement is due to two innovations. First, the search
space is treated as the product manifold $\mathbf{SO(3)x(SO(3)\setminus S^1)}$,
where $\mathbf{SO(3)}$ is the rotation group representing the space of the
rotating ligand, and $\mathbf{(SO(3)\setminus S^1)}$ is the space spanned by
the two Euler angles that define the orientation of the vector from the center
of the fixed receptor toward the center of the ligand. This representation
enables the use of efficient FFT methods developed for $\mathbf{SO(3)}$.
Second, we select the centers of highly populated clusters of docked
structures, rather than the lowest energy conformations, as predictions of the
complex, and hence there is no need for very high accuracy in energy
evaluation. Therefore it is sufficient to use a limited number of spherical
basis functions in the Fourier space, which increases the efficiency of
sampling while retaining the accuracy of docking results. A major advantage of
the method is that, in contrast to classical approaches, increasing the number
of correlation function terms is computationally inexpensive, which enables
using complex energy functions for scoring.

1609.06763	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Predicting evolutionary rescue via evolving plasticity in stochastic
  environments"	"  Phenotypic plasticity and its evolution may help evolutionary rescue in a
novel and stressful environment, especially if environmental novelty reveals
cryptic genetic variation that enables the evolution of increased plasticity.
However, the environmental stochasticity ubiquitous in natural systems may
alter these predictions because high plasticity may amplify
phenotype-environment mismatches. Although previous studies have highlighted
this potential detrimental effect of plasticity in stochastic environments,
they have not investigated how it affects extinction risk in the context of
evolutionary rescue and with evolving plasticity. We investigate this question
here by integrating stochastic demography with quantitative genetic theory in a
model with simultaneous change in the mean and predictability (temporal
autocorrelation) of the environment. We develop an approximate prediction of
long-term persistence under the new pattern of environmental fluctuations, and
compare it with numerical simulations for short- and long-term extinction risk.
We find that reduced predictability increases extinction risk and reduces
persistence because it increases stochastic load during rescue. This
understanding of how stochastic demography, phenotypic plasticity, and
evolution interact when evolution acts on cryptic genetic variation revealed in
a novel environment can inform expectations for invasions, extinctions, or the
emergence of chemical resistance in pests.

  early diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease"	"  Autocatalytic fibril nucleation has recently been proposed to be a
determining factor for the spread of neurodegenerative diseases, but the same
process could also be exploited to amplify minute quantities of protein
aggregates in a diagnostic context. Recent advances in microfluidic technology
allow analysis of protein aggregation in micron-scale samples potentially
enabling such diagnostic approaches, but the theoretical foundations for the
analysis and interpretation of such data are so far lacking. Here we study
computationally the onset of protein aggregation in small volumes and show that
the process is ruled by intrinsic fluctuations whose volume dependent
distribution we also estimate theoretically. Based on these results, we develop
a strategy to quantify in silico the statistical errors associated with the
detection of aggregate containing samples. Our work opens a new perspective on
the forecasting of protein aggregation in asymptomatic subjects.

  the active site in endoglucanase Cel8A"	"  Cellulosomes are complex multi-enzyme machineries which efficiently degrade
plant cell-wall polysaccharides. The multiple domains of the cellulosome
proteins are often tethered together by intrinsically disordered regions. The
properties and functions of these disordered linkers are not well understood.
In this work, we study endoglucanase Cel8A, which is a relevant enzymatic
component of the cellulosomes of Clostridium thermocellum. We use both all-atom
and coarse-grained simulations to investigate how the equilibrium conformations
of the catalytic domain of Cel8A are affected by the disordered linker at its C
terminus. We find that when the endoglucanase is bound to its substrate, the
effective stiffness of the linker can influence the distances between groups of
amino-acid residues throughout the entire enzymatic domain. In particular,
variations in the linker stiffness can lead to small changes in the geometry of
the active-site cleft. We suggest that such geometrical changes may, in turn,
have an effect on the catalytic activity of the enzyme.

  M-estimation"	"  When recovering an unknown signal from noisy measurements, the computational
difficulty of performing optimal Bayesian MMSE (minimum mean squared error)
inference often necessitates the use of maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference, a
special case of regularized M-estimation, as a surrogate. However, MAP is
suboptimal in high dimensions, when the number of unknown signal components is
similar to the number of measurements. In this work we demonstrate, when the
signal distribution and the likelihood function associated with the noise are
both log-concave, that optimal MMSE performance is asymptotically achievable
via another M-estimation procedure. This procedure involves minimizing convex
loss and regularizer functions that are nonlinearly smoothed versions of the
widely applied MAP optimization problem. Our findings provide a new heuristic
derivation and interpretation for recent optimal M-estimators found in the
setting of linear measurements and additive noise, and further extend these
results to nonlinear measurements with non-additive noise. We numerically
demonstrate superior performance of our optimal M-estimators relative to MAP.
Overall, at the heart of our work is the revelation of a remarkable equivalence
between two seemingly very different computational problems: namely that of
high dimensional Bayesian integration underlying MMSE inference, and high
dimensional convex optimization underlying M-estimation. In essence we show
that the former difficult integral may be computed by solving the latter,
simpler optimization problem.

  evolutionary social dilemmas"	"  In times of plenty expectations rise, just as in times of crisis they fall.
This can be mathematically described as a Win-Stay-Lose-Shift strategy with
dynamic aspiration levels, where individuals aspire to be as wealthy as their
average neighbor. Here we investigate this model in the realm of evolutionary
social dilemmas on the square lattice and scale-free networks. By using the
master equation and Monte Carlo simulations, we find that cooperators coexist
with defectors in the whole phase diagram, even at high temptations to defect.
We study the microscopic mechanism that is responsible for the striking
persistence of cooperative behavior and find that cooperation spreads through
second-order neighbors, rather than by means of network reciprocity that
dominates in imitation-based models. For the square lattice the master equation
can be solved analytically in the large temperature limit of the Fermi
function, while for other cases the resulting differential equations must be
solved numerically. Either way, we find good qualitative agreement with the
Monte Carlo simulation results. Our analysis also reveals that the evolutionary
outcomes are to a large degree independent of the network topology, including
the number of neighbors that are considered for payoff determination on
lattices, which further corroborates the local character of the microscopic
dynamics. Unlike large-scale spatial patterns that typically emerge due to
network reciprocity, here local checkerboard-like patterns remain virtually
unaffected by differences in the macroscopic properties of the interaction
network.

  species"	"  Wild populations of Medicago ciliaris and Medicago polymorpha were subjected
to four salt treatments 0, 50, 100 and 150 mM NaCl, plant growth and proline
concentration in leaves were assessed. The analyzed data revealed significant
variability in salt response within and between the two species, depending on
the salinity level. It was found that high NaCl concentrations affected all the
growth parameters. However, the reduction was more important at higher NaCl
concentrations and the highest reduction was obtained for the populations of
Medicago polymorpha where it reached around 90% in root length at 150 mM NaCl
for Pmar. The Tunisian population of Medicago ciliaris, prospected on soils
affected by salinity, was the best tolerant in all ecotypes studied in this
work. This population, exhibits a particular adaptability to salt environment
at both germination and seedling stage. Furthermore, the correlation among the
studied plants sensitivity and leaf proline concentration showed that high
proline contents were related to their reactivity to salt. Consequently, it
appeared that proline biosynthesis occurred presumably as a consequence of
disturbance in cell homoeostasis and reflected poor performance and greater
damage in response to salt stress. These findings indicated that this osmolytes
content may be used as another useful criterion to differentiate salt-tolerant
from salt sensitive plant in annual medics.

two-population snowdrift game. The first mechanism follows the traditional
approach in the literature and is based on the inclusion of a third additional
strategy in the payoff matrix of the stage-game. The second mechanism consists
of letting cooperators to punish defectors with a given exogenous frequency.
While both mechanisms share the same result regarding the minimum required
level of punishment in order to eliminate defectors in both populations,
stability in the mechanism following the second approach is more robust in the
sense that extinction of defectors is a globally asymptotically stable state
for any interior initial conditions in the phase space. Results were obtained
analytically through non-linear differential equations and also using an
agent-based simulation. There was a good level of agreement between both
approaches with respect to the evolutionary pattern over time and the possible
steady-states.

normal human immune response to a bacterial, viral or fungal infection becomes
dysfunctional and triggers widespread inflammation that results in severe
tissue damage that leads to organ failure, shock, and death. Sepsis, requires
immediate treatment and has a high readmission rate for survivors. It is also
one of the most expensive conditions to treat. In 2013, there were more than
1.6 million cases of sepsis in the United States with a financial cost of more
than $23 billion. Sepsis was first described in antiquity, and given its
current name, by the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates. Despite its long
medical history, severity, and financial burden, the causes of sepsis are not
well understood, and there is no standard approach to diagnosis and treatment.
The definition of sepsis, the characterization of its clinical stages, and
sepsis monitoring tools have changed three times in the past 25 years, most
recently in March 2016. The universal adoption of this latest definition,
sepsis-3, and a screening tool, qSOFA, are currently under debate in the
medical community. A means to rapidly identify and treat sepsis could reduce
the five million deaths due to sepsis each year worldwide. This paper reviews
the evolution of the definition of sepsis and the controversy surrounding the

1609.07267	q-bio	physics.med-ph physics.bio-ph q-bio.TO	Non-invasive evaluation of skin tension lines with elastic waves	"  Background: Since their discovery by Karl Langer in the 19th Century, Skin
Tension Lines (STLs) have been used by surgeons to decide the location and
orientation of an incision. Although these lines are patient-specific, most
surgeons rely on generic maps to determine their orientation. Beyond the
imprecise pinch test, there remains no accepted method for determining STLs in
vivo.
  Methods: (i) The speed of an elastic motion travelling radially on the skin
of canine cadavers was measured with a commercial device called the
Reviscometer. (ii) Similar to the original experiments conducted by Karl
Langer, circular excisions were made on the skin and the geometric changes to
the resulting wounds and excised samples were used to determine the orientation
of STLs.
  Results: A marked anisotropy in the speed of the elastic wave travelling
radially was observed. The orientation of the fastest wave was found to
correlate with the orientation of the elongated wound (P<0.001, R^2 = 74%).
Similarly, the orientation of fastest wave was the same for both in vivo and
excised isolated samples, indicating that the STLs have a structural basis.
Resulting wounds expanded by an average area of 9% (+16% along STL and -10%
across) while excised skin shrunk by an average area of 33% (23% along STL and
10% across).
  Conclusion: Elastic surface wave propagation has been validated
experimentally as a robust method for determining the orientation of STLs
non-destructively and non-invasively. This study has implications for the
identification of STLs and for the prediction of skin tension levels, both
important factors in both human and veterinary reconstructive surgery.

computable biomarker for the assessment of spontaneous aesthetic brain

well-established measures of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) and quantifies the
music-induced alterations in the dynamic relationships between brain rhythms.
During a stage of exploratory analysis, and using the signals from a suitably
designed experiment, we established the biomarker, which acts on brain
activations recorded over the left prefrontal cortex and focuses on the
functional coupling between high-beta and low-gamma oscillations. Based on data
from an additional experimental paradigm, we validated the introduced biomarker
and showed its relevance for expressing the subjective aesthetic appreciation
of a piece of music. Our approach resulted in an affordable tool that can
promote human-machine interaction and, by serving as a personalized music
annotation strategy, can be potentially integrated into modern flexible music
recommendation systems.

  Bacteria"	"  During last years theoretical works shed new light and proposed new
hypothesis on the mechanisms which regulate the time behaviour of biological
populations in different natural systems. Despite of this, the role of
environmental variables in ecological systems is still an open question.
Filling this gap of knowledge is a crucial task for a deeper comprehension of
the dynamics of biological populations in real ecosystems. In this work we
study how the dynamics of food spoilage bacteria influences the sensory
characteristics of fresh fish specimens. This topic is crucial for a better
understanding of the role played by the bacterial growth on the organoleptic
properties, and for the quality evaluation and risk assessment of food
products. We therefore analyze the time behaviour, in fresh fish specimens, of
sensory characteristics starting from the growth curves of two spoilage
bacterial communities. The theoretical study, initially based on a
deterministic model, exploits experimental temperature profiles. As a first
step, a model of predictive microbiology is used to reproduce the experimental
behaviour of the two bacterial populations. Afterwards, the theoretical
bacterial growths are converted, through suitable differential equations, into
""sensory"" scores, based on the Quality Index Method (QIM), a scoring system for
freshness and quality sensory estimation of fishery products. As a third step,
the theoretical curves of QIM scores are compared with the experimental data
obtained by sensory analysis. Finally, the differential equations for QIM
scores are modified by adding terms of multiplicative white noise, which mimics
the effects of uncertainty and variability in sensory analysis. A better
agreement between experimental and theoretical QIM scores is observed, in some
cases, in the presence of suitable values of noise intensity respect to the
deterministic analysis.

1609.07461	q-bio	q-bio.SC	Effect of gene-expression bursts on stochastic timing of cellular events	"  Gene expression is inherently a noisy process which manifests as cell-to-cell
variability in time evolution of proteins. Consequently, events that trigger at
critical threshold levels of regulatory proteins exhibit stochasticity in their
timing. An important contributor to the noise in gene expression is translation
bursts which correspond to randomness in number of proteins produced in a
single mRNA lifetime. Modeling timing of an event as a first-passage time (FPT)
problem, we explore the effect of burst size distribution on event timing.
Towards this end, the probability density function of FPT is computed for a
gene expression model with burst size drawn from a generic non-negative
distribution. Analytical formulas for FPT moments are provided in terms of
known vectors and inverse of a matrix. The effect of burst size distribution is
investigated by looking at how the feedback regulation strategy that minimizes
noise in timing around a given time deviates from the case when burst is
deterministic. Interestingly, results show that the feedback strategy for
deterministic burst case is quite robust to change in burst size distribution,
and deviations from it are confined to about 20% of the optimal value. These
findings facilitate an improved understanding of noise regulation in event
timing.

  network architecture of the human skull"	"  The premature fusion of cranial bones, craniosynostosis, affects the correct
development of the skull producing morphological malformations in newborns. To
assess the susceptibility of each craniofacial articulation to close
prematurely, we used a network model of the skull to quantify the link
reliability (an index based on stochastic block modeling and Bayesian
inference) of each articulation. We show that, of the 93 human skull
articulations at birth, the few articulations that are associated with
nonsyndromic craniosynostosis conditions have statistically significant lower
reliability scores than the others. In a similar way, articulations that close
during the normal postnatal development of the skull have also lower
reliability scores than those articulations that persist through adult live.
These results indicate a relationship between the architecture of the skull
network and the specific articulations that close during normal development and
in pathological conditions. Our findings suggest that the topological
arrangement of skull bones might act as an epigenetic factor, predisposing some
articulations to closure, both in normal and pathological development, and also
affecting the long-term evolution of the skull.

traditional approaches of reading volumetric data from individual files. This
work describes the D4M and SciDB tools we developed and presents the initial

cooperation and other altruistic behavior among naturally selfish individuals.
However, most real social interactions are temporal, being both finite in
duration and spread out over time. This raises the question of whether stable
cooperation can form despite an intrinsically fragmented social fabric. Here we
develop a framework to study the evolution of cooperation on temporal networks
in the setting of the classic Prisoner's Dilemma. By analyzing both real and
synthetic datasets, we find that temporal networks generally facilitate the
evolution of cooperation compared to their static counterparts. More
interestingly, we find that the intrinsic human interactive pattern like bursty
behavior impedes the evolution of cooperation. Finally, we introduce a measure
to quantify the temporality present in networks and demonstrate that there is
an intermediate level of temporality that boosts cooperation most. Our results
open a new avenue for investigating the evolution of cooperation in more
realistic structured populations.

main causes of cognitive dysfunction in humans. Both manifestations exhibit the
extensive presence of focal axonal swellings (FAS). FAS compromises the
information encoded in spike trains, thus leading to potentially severe
functional deficits. Complicating our understanding of the impact of FAS is our
inability to access small scale injuries with non-invasive methods, the overall
complexity of neuronal pathologies, and our limited knowledge of how networks
process biological signals. Building on Hopfield's pioneering work, we extend a
model for associative memory to account for FAS and its impact on memory
encoding. We calibrate all FAS parameters from biophysical observations of
their statistical distribution and size, providing a framework to simulate the
effects of brain disorders on memory recall performance. A face recognition
example is used to demonstrate and validate the functionality of the novel
model. Our results link memory recall ability to observed FAS statistics,
allowing for a description of different stages of brain disorders within
neuronal networks. This provides a first theoretical model to bridge
experimental observations of FAS in neurodegeneration and TBI with compromised
memory recall, thus closing the large gap between theory and experiment on how
biological signals are processed in damaged, high-dimensional functional
networks. The work further lends new insight into positing diagnostic tools to

macromolecules in brine channels is tested offline in a reduced model of pack
geochemistry. Driver physical quantities are extracted from the global sea ice
dynamics code CICE, including snow height, column thickness and internal
temperature. The variables are averaged at the regional scale over ten Arctic
biogeographic zones and treated as input matrices at four vertical habitat
levels. Nutrient-light-salt limited ice algal growth is computed along with the
associated grazing plus mortality. Vertical transport is diffusive but responds
to pore structure. Simulated bottom layer chlorophyll maxima are reasonable,
though delayed by about a month relative to observations. This highlights major
uncertainties deriving from snow thickness variability. Upper level biota are
generated intermittently through flooding. Macromolecular injections are
represented by the compound classes humics, proteins, polysaccharides and
lipids. The fresh biopolymers behave in a successional manner and are removed
by bacteria. In baseline runs, organics are introduced solely through cell
disruption, and internal carbon is biased low. Continuous exudation is
therefore appended, and agreement with dissolved organic or individual
biopolymer measurements is achieved when strong release is coupled to light
availability. Detrital carbon then reaches hundreds of micromolar, sufficient
to support physical changes to the ice matrix. Through this optimized model
version we address the question, are high molecular weight organics added to
the brine network over and above background spillage? The mechanism is
configured for ready extension to the Antarctic, so that global ice organic
chemistry issues can be targeted.

correction to the Michaelis-Menten equation for the reaction-rates. The
relevance and validity of this correction for enzymatic reactions and
intracellular gene-regulation is demonstrated. Our analytical theory and
simulation results confirm that the proposed variance-corrected
Michaelis-Menten equation predicts the rate of reactions with remarkable
accuracy even in the presence of large non-equilibrium concentration
fluctuations. The major advantage of our approach is that it involves only the
mean and variance of the substrate-molecule concentration. Our theory is
therefore accessible to experiments and not specific to the exact source of the

  predator-prey decision-making"	"  We study the degree of success of a single predator hunting a herd of prey on
a two dimensional square lattice landscape. We explicitly consider the self
volume of the prey restraining their dynamics on the lattice. The movement of
both predator and prey is chosen to include an intelligent, decision making
step based on their respective sighting ranges, the radius in which they can
detect the other species (prey cannot recognise each other besides the self
volume interaction): after spotting each other the motion of prey and predator
turns from a nearest neighbour random walk into direct escape or chase,
respectively. We consider a large range of prey densities and sighting ranges
and compute the mean first passage time for a predator to catch a prey as well
as characterise the effective dynamics of the hunted prey. We find that the
prey's sighting range dominates their life expectancy and the predator profits
more from a bad eyesight of the prey than from his own good eye sight. We
characterise the dynamics in terms of the mean distance between the predator
and the nearest prey. It turns out that effectively the dynamics of this
distance coordinate can be captured in terms of a simple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
picture. Reducing the many-body problem to a simple two-body problem by
imagining predator and nearest prey to be connected by a Hookean bond, all
features of the model such as prey density and sighting ranges merge into the
effective binding constant.

1609.07892	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio.BM	"In vivo compaction dynamics of bacterial DNA: A fingerprint of DNA/RNA
  demixing ?"	"  The volume occupied by unconstrained bacterial DNA in physiological solutions
exceeds 1000 times the volume of the cell. Still, it is confined to a well
defined region of the cell called the nucleoid, which occupies only a fraction
of the cell volume. There is still no general agreement on the mechanism
leading to the compaction of the DNA and the formation of the nucleoid.
However, advances in in vivo sub-wavelength resolution microscopy techniques
have recently allowed the observation of the nucleoid at an unprecedented level
of detail. In particular, these observations show that the compaction of the
nucleoid is not static but is instead a highly dynamic feature, which depends
on several factors, like the richness of the nutrient, the cell cycle stage,
temperature, the action of an osmotic shock or antibiotics, etc. After a short
description of the electrolyte content of the cytosol and a brief overview of
the different mechanisms that may lead to the formation of the nucleoid, this
paper reviews some of the most fascinating recent results of in vivo
sub-wavelength resolution microscopy. It is furthermore argued that these
observations provide converging indications in favor of a model that describes
the cytosol as an aqueous electrolyte solution containing several
macromolecular species, where demixing and segregative phase separation occur
between DNA and RNA (essentially rRNA and mRNA involved in translation
complexes, but also the large amounts of rRNA synthesized at the rrn operons of
cells growing in rich media). It is also pointed out that crowding may play a
crucial role through its synergy with electrostatic forces. By constraining
macromolecules to remain at short distances from one another and feel
electrostatic interactions in spite of the strong screening exerted by
electrolyte species, crowding favors stronger DNA/RNA demixing and nucleoid
compaction.

using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We obtain a previously
unreported estimation of the folding free energy using parallel tempering in
combination with well-tempered metadynamics. A key ingredient is the use of a
recently developed metric distance, eRMSD, as a biased collective variable. We
find that the native fold of both tetraloops is not the global free energy
minimum using the Amber\c{hi}OL3 force field. The estimated folding free
energies are 30.2kJ/mol for UUCG and 7.5 kJ/mol for GAGA, in striking
disagreement with experimental data. We evaluate the viability of all possible
one-dimensional backbone force field corrections. We find that disfavoring the
gauche+ region of {\alpha} and {\zeta} angles consistently improves the
existing force field. The level of accuracy achieved with these corrections,
however, cannot be considered sufficient by judging on the basis of available
thermodynamic data and solution experiments.

  implications of the diverse neural substrates underlying human memory systems"	"  The neural basis of human memory is incredibly complex. We argue that the
diversity of neural systems underlying various forms of memory suggests that
any discussion of enhancing 'memory' per se is too broad, thus obfuscating the
biopolitical debate about human enhancement. Memory can be differentiated into
at least four major (and several minor) systems with largely dissociable (i.e.,
non-overlapping) neural substrates. We outline each system, and discuss both
the practical and the ethical implications of these diverse neural substrates.
In practice, distinct neural bases imply the possibility, and likely the
necessity, of specific approaches for the safe and effective enhancement of
various memory systems. In the debate over the ethical and social implications
of enhancement technologies, this fine-grained perspective clarifies - and may
partially mitigate - certain common concerns in enhancement debates, including
issues related to safety, fairness, coercion, and authenticity. While many
researchers certainly appreciate the neurobiological complexity of memory, the
political debate tends to revolve around a monolithic one-size-fits-all
conception. The overall project - exploring how human enhancement technologies
affect society - stands to benefit from a deeper appreciation of memory's
neurobiological diversity.

  diffusion and bioenergetics"	"  In order to model ion transport across protocell membranes in Hadean
hydrothermal vents, we consider both theoretically and experimentally the
planar growth of a precipitate membrane formed at the interface between two
parallel fluid streams in a two-dimensional microfluidic reactor. The growth
rate of the precipitate is found to be proportional to the square root of time,
which is characteristic of diffusive transport. However, the dependence of the
growth rate on the concentrations of hydroxide and metal ions is approximately
linear and quadratic, respectively. We show that such a difference in ionic
transport dynamics arises from the enhanced transport of metal ions across a
thin gel layer present at the surface of the precipitate. The fluctuations in
transverse velocity in this wavy porous gel layer allow an enhanced transport
of the cation, so that the effective diffusivity is about an order of magnitude
higher than that expected from molecular diffusion alone. Our theoretical
predictions are in excellent agreement with our laboratory measurements of the
growth of a manganese hydroxide membrane in a microfluidic channel, and this
enhanced transport is thought to have been needed to account for the
bioenergetics of the first single-celled organisms.

understand the role of sexual transmission in the spread of diseases with a
primarily non-sexual transmission route. In this paper we develop a number of
low-dimensional models which are appropriate for a range of assumptions for how
a disease will spread if it has sexual transmission through a sexual contact
network combined with some other transmission mechanism, such as direct contact
or vectors. The equations derived provide exact predictions for the dynamics of

  Deficiencies"	"  The computer-aided folding of biomolecules, particularly RNAs, is one of the
most difficult challenges in computational structural biology. RNA tetraloops
are fundamental RNA motifs playing key roles in RNA folding and RNA-RNA and
RNA-protein interactions. Although state-of-the-art Molecular Dynamics (MD)
force fields correctly describe the native state of these tetraloops as a
stable free-energy basin on the microsecond time scale, enhanced sampling
techniques reveal that the native state is not the global free energy minimum,
suggesting yet unidentified significant imbalances in the force fields. Here,
we tested our ability to fold the RNA tetraloops in various force fields and
simulation settings. We employed three different enhanced sampling techniques,
namely, temperature replica exchange MD (T-REMD), replica exchange with solute
tempering (REST2), and well-tempered metadynamics (WT-MetaD). We aimed to
separate problems caused by limited sampling from those due to force-field
inaccuracies. We found that none of the contemporary force fields is able to
correctly describe folding of the 5'-GAGA-3' tetraloop over a range of
simulation conditions. We thus aimed to identify which terms of the force field
are responsible for this poor description of TL folding. We showed that at
least two different imbalances contribute to this behavior, namely,
overstabilization of base-phosphate and/or sugar-phosphate interactions and
underestimated stability of the hydrogen bonding interaction in base pairing.
The first artifact stabilizes the unfolded ensemble, while the second one
destabilizes the folded state. The former problem might be partially alleviated
by reparametrization of the van der Waals parameters of the phosphate oxygens
suggested by Case et al., while in order to overcome the latter effect we
suggest local potentials to better capture hydrogen bonding interactions.

  effects"	"  Numerous studies have attempted to model the effect of mass media on the
transmission of diseases such as influenza, however quantitative data on media
engagement has until recently been difficult to obtain. With the recent
explosion of ""big data"" coming from online social media and the like, large
volumes of data on a population's engagement with mass media during an epidemic
are becoming available to researchers. In this study we combine an online data
set comprising millions of shared messages relating to influenza with
traditional surveillance data on flu activity to suggest a functional form for
the relationship between the two. Using this data we present a simple
deterministic model for influenza dynamics incorporating media effects, and
show that such a model helps explain the dynamics of historical influenza
outbreaks. Furthermore, through model selection we show that the proposed media
function fits historical data better than other media functions proposed in
earlier studies.

1609.08310	q-bio	q-bio.MN	"The accuracy of biochemical interactions is ensured by endothermic
  stepwise kinetics"	"  The discerning behavior of living systems relies on accurate interactions
selected from the lot of molecular collisions occurring in the cell. To ensure
the reliability of interactions, binding partners are classically envisioned as
finely preadapted molecules, evolutionarily selected on the basis of their
affinity in one-step associations. But the counterselection of inappropriate
interactions can in fact be much more efficiently obtained through difficult
multi-step adjustment, whose final high energy state is locked by a fluctuation
ratchet. The progressive addition of molecular bonds during stereo-adjustment
can be modeled as a predominantly backward random walk whose first arrival is
frozen by a micro-irreversible transition. A new criterion of ligand
specificity is presented, that is based on the ratio rejection/incorporation.
In addition to its role in the selectivity of interactions, this generic recipe
can underlie other important biological phenomena such as the regular synthesis
at low level of supramolecular complexes, monostable kinetic bimodality,
substrate concentration thresholds or the preparation of rapidly
depolymerizable structureswith stored energy, like microtubules.

1609.08318	q-bio	q-bio.MN	"Conformational selection or induced fit? New insights from old
  principles"	"  A long standing debate in biochemistry is to determine whether the
conformational changes observed during biomolecular interactions proceed
through conformational selection (of preexisting isoforms) or induced fit
(ligand-induced 3D reshaping). The latter mechanism had been invoked in certain
circumstances, for example to explain the non-Michaelian activity of monomeric
enzymes like glucokinase. But the relative importance of induced fit has been
recently depreciated in favor of conformational selection, assumed to be always
sufficient, predominant in general and in particular for glucokinase. The
relative contributions of conformational selection and induced fit are
reconsidered here in and out of equilibrium, in the light of earlier concepts
such as the cyclic equilibrium rule and the turning wheel of Wyman, using
single molecule state probability, one way fluxes and net fluxes. The
conditions for a switch from conformational selection to induced fit at a given
ligand concentration are explicitly determined. Out of equilibrium, the
inspection of the enzyme states circuit shows that conformational selection
alone would give a Michaelian reaction rate but not the established nonlinear
behaviour of glucokinase. Moreover, when induced fit and conformational
selection coexist and allow kinetic cooperativity, the net flux emerging in the
linkage cycle necessarily corresponds to the induced fit path.

robustly ensured in living systems by steady state mechanisms with permanent
molecule renewal. This misconception is likely to result from misleading
intuitions and insufficient dialogues between traditional and quantitative
biologists. To demystify dynamic epigenetics, its most famous image, a

characteristics of dynamic gene networks, underlying cellular differentiation,

observed to be highly heterogeneous, with the majority of individuals having
fewer contacts than the mean, and a significant minority having relatively very
many contacts. We derive a two-dimensional diffusion model for the full
temporal behavior of the stochastic susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR)
model on such a network, by making use of a time-scale separation in the
deterministic limit of the dynamics. This low-dimensional process is an
accurate approximation to the full model in the limit of large populations,
even for cases when the time-scale separation is not too pronounced, provided
the maximum degree is not of the order of the population size.

numerical simulations, while analytic formulations lack both general results

1609.08611	q-bio	q-bio.PE math.AP	Expansion under climate change: the genetic consequences	"  Range expansion and range shifts are crucial population responses to climate
change. Genetic consequences are not well understood but are clearly coupled to
ecological dynamics that, in turn, are driven by shifting climate conditions.
We model a population with a deterministic reaction-- diffusion model coupled
to a heterogeneous environment that develops in time due to climate change. We
decompose the resulting travelling wave solution into neutral genetic
components to analyse the spatio-temporal dynamics of its genetic structure.
Our analysis shows that range expansions and range shifts under slow climate
change preserve genetic diversity. This is because slow climate change creates
range boundaries that promote spatial mixing of genetic components.
Mathematically , the mixing leads to so-called pushed travelling wave
solutions. This mixing phenomenon is not seen in spatially homogeneous
environments, where range expansion reduces genetic diversity through gene
surfing arising from pulled travelling wave solutions. However, the
preservation of diversity is diminished when climate change occurs too quickly.
Using diversity indices, we show that fast expansions and range shifts erode
genetic diversity more than slow range expansions and range shifts. Our study
provides analytical insight into the dynamics of travelling wave solutions in
heterogeneous environments.

are often used to describe the shape and motion of individual cells. Although
these models have been widely adopted, relatively little is known about their
basic theoretical properties. For example, while fourfold vertices in real
foams are always unstable, it remains unclear whether a simplified vertex model
description has the same behavior. Here, we study vertex stability and the
dynamics of T1 topological transitions in vertex models. We show that, when all
edges have the same tension, stationary fourfold vertices in these models do
indeed always break up. In contrast, when tensions are allowed to depend on
edge orientation, fourfold vertices can become stable, as is observed in some
biological systems. More generally, our formulation of vertex stability leads
to an improved treatment of T1 transitions in simulations and paves the way for
studies of more biologically realistic models that couple topological
transitions to the dynamics of regulatory proteins.

1609.08784	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Gene networks accelerate evolution by fitness landscape learning	"  We consider evolution of a large population, where fitness of each organism
is defined by many phenotypical traits. These traits result from expression of
many genes. We propose a new model of gene regulation, where gene expression is
controlled by a gene network with a threshold mechanism and there is a feedback
between that threshold and gene expression. We show that this regulation is
very powerful: depending on parameters we can obtain any functional connection
between thresholds and genes. Under general assumptions on fitness we prove
that such model organisms are capable, to some extent, to recognize the fitness
landscape. That fitness landscape learning sharply reduces the number of
mutations necessary for adaptation and thus accelerates of evolution. Moreover,
this learning increases phenotype robustness with respect to mutations.
However, this acceleration leads to an additional risk since learning procedure
can produce errors. Finally evolution acceleration reminds races on a rugged
highway: when you speed up, you have more chances to crash. These results
explain recent experimental data on anticipation of environment changes by some
organisms.

membrane potential density in a network of spiking neurons, a low-dimensional
dynamics of the collective firing rate is derived. As a result a $n$-order
ordinary differential equation for the network activity can be worked out by
taking into account the slowest $n$ modes of the expansion. The resulting
low-dimensional dynamics naturally takes into account the strength of the
synaptic couplings under the hypothesis of a not too fast changing membrane
potential density. By considering only the two slowest modes, the firing rate
dynamics is equivalent to the one of a damped oscillator in which the angular
frequency and the relaxation time are state-dependent. The presented results
apply to a wide class of networks of one-compartment neuron models.

several countries, it involves potential interactions between wildlife and
cattle and creates societal problems in terms of human-wildlife conflict. This
study addresses connectedness network analysis, the spatial, and temporal
dynamics of TB between cattle in farms and the European badger (Meles meles)
using a large dataset generated by a calibrated agent based model. Results
showed that infected network connectedness was lower in badgers than in cattle.
The contribution of an infected individual to the mean distance of disease
spread over time was considerably lower for badger than cattle; badgers mainly
spread the disease locally while cattle infected both locally and across longer
distances. The majority of badger-induced infections occurred when individual
badgers leave their home sett, and this was positively correlated with badger
population growth rates. Point pattern analysis indicated aggregation in the
spatial pattern of TB prevalence in badger setts across all scales. The spatial
distribution of farms that were not TB free was aggregated at different scales
than the spatial distribution of infected badgers and became random at larger
scales. The spatial cross correlation between infected badger setts and
infected farms revealed that generally infected setts and farms do not coexist
except at few scales. Temporal autocorrelation detected a two year infection
cycle for badgers, while there was both within the year and longer cycles for
infected cattle. Temporal cross correlation indicated that infection cycles in
badgers and cattle are negatively correlated. The implications of these results
for understanding the dynamics of the disease are discussed.

apically by reversible addition of elementary building blocks. But beyond this
common principle, the modalities of fibril formation are very disparate, with
various intermediate forms which can be reshuffled by minor modifications of
physico-chemical conditions or amino-acid sequences. To bypass this complexity,
the multifaceted phenomenon of fibril formation is reduced here to its most
elementary principles defined for a linear prototype of fibril. Selected
generic features, including nucleation, elongation and conformational
recruitment, are modeled using minimalist hypotheses and tools, by separating
equilibrium from kinetic aspects and in vitro from in vivo conditions. These
reductionist approaches allow to bring out known and new rudiments, including
the kinetic and equilibrium effects of nucleation, the dual influence of
elongation on nucleation, the kinetic limitations on nucleation and fibril
numbers and the accumulation of complexes in vivo by rescue from degradation.
Overlooked aspects of these processes are also pointed: the exponential
distribution of fibril lengths can be recovered using various models because it
is attributable to randomness only. It is also suggested that the same term
""critical concentration"" is used for different things, involved in either
nucleation or elongation.

  oscillating, rotating and migrating cells"	"  How the cells break symmetry and organize their edge activity to move
directionally is a fun- damental question in cell biology. Physical models of
cell motility commonly rely on gradients of regulatory factors and/or feedback
from the motion itself to describe polarization of edge activity. Theses
approaches, however, fail to explain cell behavior prior to the onset of
polarization. Our analysis using the model system of polarizing and moving fish
epidermal keratocytes suggests a novel and simple principle of
self-organization of cell activity in which local cell-edge dynamics depends on
the distance from the cell center, but not on the orientation with respect to
the front-back axis. We validate this principle with a stochastic model that
faithfully reproduces a range of cell-migration behaviors. Our findings
indicate that spontaneous polarization, persistent motion, and cell shape are
emergent properties of the local cell-edge dynamics controlled by the distance
from the cell center.

from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) datasets from the human brain. Before the
present work, no high-definition directed braingraphs (or connectomes) were
published, because the tractography methods in use are not capable of assigning
directions to the neural tracts discovered. Previous work on the functional
connectomes applied low-resolution functional MRI-detected statistical
causality for the assignment of directions of connectomes of typically several
dozens of vertices. Our method is based on the phenomenon of the ""Consensus
Connectome Dynamics"" (CCD), described earlier by our research group. In this
contribution, we apply the method to the 423 braingraphs, each with 1015
vertices, computed from the public release of the Human Connectome Project, and
we also made the directed connectomes publicly available at the site
\url{http://braingraph.org}. We also show the robustness of our edge directing
method in four independently chosen connectome datasets: we have found that
86\% of the edges, which were present in all four datasets, get the very same
directions in all datasets; therefore the direction method is robust, it does
not depend on the particular choice of the dataset. We think that our present
contribution opens up new possibilities in the analysis of the high-definition
human connectome: from now on we can work with a robust assignment of
directions of the connections of the human brain.

  to compare transmission trees"	"  Reconstructing who infected whom is a central challenge in analysing
epidemiological data. Recently, advances in sequencing technology have led to
increasing interest in Bayesian approaches to inferring who infected whom using
genetic data from pathogens. The logic behind such approaches is that isolates
that are nearly genetically identical are more likely to have been recently
transmitted than those that are very different. A number of methods have been
developed to perform this inference. However, testing their convergence,
examining posterior sets of transmission trees and comparing methods'
performance are challenged by the fact that the object of inference - the
transmission tree - is a complicated discrete structure. We introduce a metric
on transmission trees to quantify distances between them. The metric can
accommodate trees with unsampled individuals, and highlights differences in the
source case and in the number of infections per infector. We illustrate its
performance on simple simulated scenarios and on posterior transmission trees
from a TB outbreak. We find that the metric reveals where the posterior is
sensitive to the priors, and where collections of trees are composed of
distinct clusters. We use the metric to define median trees summarising these
clusters. Quantitative tools to compare transmission trees to each other will
be required for assessing MCMC convergence, exploring posterior trees and
benchmarking diverse methods as this field continues to mature.

ability to diagnose and monitor the progression of underlying pathologies at
the cellular level. Physics and physiology limit the resolution of human MRI to
millimeters, three orders of magnitude coarser than the cell dimensions of
microns. A promising way to access cellular structure is provided by
diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), a modality which exploits the sensitivity of the
MRI signal to micron-level Brownian motion of water molecules strongly hindered
by cell walls. By analyzing diffusion of water molecules in human subjects,
here we demonstrate that biophysical modeling has the potential to break the
intrinsic MRI resolution limits. The observation of a universal power-law
scaling of the dMRI signal identifies the contribution from water specifically
confined inside narrow impermeable axons, validating the overarching assumption
behind models of diffusion in neuronal tissue. This scaling behavior
establishes dMRI as an in vivo instrument able to quantify intra-axonal

derived from conservation of charge, in ideal dielectrics, for example.
Conservation of current is enforced implicitly in ideal dielectrics by theories
that conserve charge. But charge movement in real materials like semiconductors
or ionic solutions is never ideal. We present an apparently universal
derivation of conservation of current and advocate using that conservation law
explicitly as a distinct part of theories and calculations of charge movement
in complex fluids and environments. Classical models using ordinary
differential equations rarely satisfy conservation of current, including the
chemical kinetic models implementing the law of mass action and Markov models.
These models must be amended if they are to conserve current. Strict
enforcement of conservation of current is likely to aid numerical analysis by
preventing artifactual accumulation of charge.

  model discriminative self-thinning in even-aged forest stands"	"  To model discriminative, i.e. competition induced, self-thinning in even-aged
forest stands a concept has been explored that discriminative mortality alters
spatial arrangement of trees which in turn alters the mortality. Function of
density was suggested to be a balance of initial density minus mortality that
was dependent on initial spatial arrangement and mean horizontal size in the
forest stand. Assuming initial spatial arrangement to be aggregation and
performing normalizations gave the self-thinning function depending on only two
parameters, initial stem density and maximal horizontal size (represented by
stem diameter). Normalizations included integral of probability of trees to
collide to be unity and stem density at maximal size to be zero. The
self-thinning function obtained has been shown to successfully capture
non-linear self-thinning dynamics in Douglas-fir long-term experiments in which
competition-induced mortality prevailed.

1609.09202	q-bio	q-bio.MN	"Transcriptional and translational regulation in Arc protein network of
  Escherichia coli's stress response"	"  Recently, there has been a lot of effort in understanding sRNA mediated
regulation of gene expression and how this mode of regulation differs from
transcriptional regulation.In E.coli, in the presence of oxidative stress, the
synthesis of sigma^s is regulated through an interesting mechanism involving
both transcriptional and sRNA-mediated translational regulation. The key
regulatory factors involved in transcriptional and translational regulation are
ArcA and ArcB proteins and ArcZ sRNA, respectively. Phosphorylated ArcA, in a
feedforward mechanism, represses the transcriptions sigma^s and ArcZ sRNA with
the latter being a post-transcriptional activator for sigma^s. Through a
feedback mechanisms, ArcZ sRNA destabilises ArcB mRNA and regulates the level
of ArcB protein, a kinase that phosphorylates ArcA. The oxygen and energy
availability is expected to influence the ArcA phosphorylation rate and, as a
consequence, in equilibrium, the system is likely to be in either a high ArcB
(low ArcZ) or a low ArcB (high ArcZ) state. Kinetic modelling studies suggest
that the rate of destabilisation of ArcB mRNA by ArcZ sRNA must be
appropriately tuned for achieving the desired state. In particular, for a high
phosphorylation rate, the transition from a low to a high ArcZ synthesis regime
with the increase in sRNA-mRNA interaction is similar to the threshold-linear
response observed earlier. Further, we show that the mRNA destabilisation by
sRNA might be, in particular, beneficial in the low phosphorylation state for
having the right concentration levels of ArcZ and ArcB. Stochastic simulation
results suggest that as the ArcZ-ArcB binding affinity is increased, the
probability distribution for the number of ArcZ molecules becomes flatter
indicating frequently occurring transcriptional bursts of varying strengths.

however, used diverse fingerprints of criticality, leaving open the question
whether they refer to a unique critical point or whether there could be
several. Using a recurrent spiking neural network as the model, we demonstrate
that avalanche criticality does not necessarily lie at the dynamical

  and cardiac arrhythmias"	"  It has recently been observed that the occurrence of sudden cardiac death has
a close statistical relationship with the time of day, viz., ventricular
fibrillation is most likely to occur between 12 am-6 am, with 6 pm-12 am being
the next most likely period. Consequently there has been significant interest
in understanding how cardiac activity is influenced by the circadian clock,
i.e., temporal oscillations in physiological activity with a period close to 24
hours and synchronized with the day-night cycle. Although studies have
identified the genetic basis of circadian rhythms at the intracellular level,
the mechanisms by which they influence cardiac pathologies are not yet fully
understood. Evidence has suggested that diurnal variations in the conductance
properties of ion channel proteins that govern the excitation dynamics of
cardiac cells may provide the crucial link. In this paper, we investigate the
relationship between the circadian rhythm as manifested in modulations of ion
channel properties and the susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias by using a
mathematical model that describes electrical activity in ventricular tissue. We
show that changes in the channel conductance that lead to extreme values for
the duration of action potentials in cardiac cells can result either in
abnormally high-frequency reentrant activity or spontaneous conduction block of
excitation waves. Both phenomena increase the likelihood of wavebreaks that are
known to initiate potentially life-threatening arrhythmias. Thus, disruptive
cardiac excitation dynamics are most likely to occur in time-intervals of the
day-night cycle during which the channel properties are closest to these
extreme values, providing an intriguing relation between circadian rhythms and
cardiac pathologies.

challenge of such analysis comes from inherent anatomical and functional
variability across subjects. One approach to resolving this is a shared
response factor model. This assumes a shared and time synchronized stimulus
across subjects. Such a model can often identify shared information, but it may
not be able to pinpoint with high resolution the spatial location of this

to identify shared information in small contiguous regions (searchlights)
across the whole brain. Validation using classification tasks demonstrates that
we can pinpoint informative local regions.

  writing movement"	"  Motor imagery (MI) is a mental representation of motor behavior that has been
widely used as a control method for a brain-computer interface (BCI), allowing
communication for the physically impaired. The performance of MI based BCI
mainly depends on the subject's ability to self-modulate EEG signals. Proper
training can help naive subjects learn to modulate brain activity proficiently.
However, training subjects typically involves abstract motor tasks and is
time-consuming. To improve the performance of naive subjects during motor
imagery, a novel paradigm was presented that would guide naive subjects to
modulate brain activity effectively. In this new paradigm, pictures of the left
or right hand were used as cues for subjects to finish the motor imagery task.
Fourteen healthy subjects (11 male, aged 22-25 years, mean 23.6+/-1.16)
participated in this study. The task was to imagine writing a Chinese
character. Specifically, subjects could imagine hand movements following the
sequence of writing strokes in the Chinese character. This paradigm was meant
to find an effective and familiar action for most Chinese people, to provide
them with a specific, extensively practiced task and help them modulate brain
activity. Results showed that the writing task paradigm yielded significantly
better performance than the traditional arrow paradigm (p<0.001). Questionnaire
replies indicated that most subjects thought the new paradigm was easier and
more comfortable. The proposed new motor imagery paradigm could guide subjects
to help them modulate brain activity effectively. Results showed that there
were significant improvements using new paradigm, both in classification
accuracy and usability.

spatial information. Neurons in the brain represent external stimuli via neural
codes. These codes often arise from stereotyped stimulus-response maps,
associating to each neuron a convex receptive field. An important problem
consists in determining what stimulus space features can be extracted directly
from a neural code. The neural ideal is an algebraic object that encodes the
full combinatorial data of a neural code. This ideal can be expressed in a
canonical form that directly translates to a minimal description of the
receptive field structure intrinsic to the code. In here, we describe a
SageMath package that contains several algorithms related to the canonical form
of a neural ideal.

inform on compound design using a recently reported and clinically relevant
inhibitor of the chromatin regulator BRD4. Benchmarking on our local compute
cluster, our implementation achieves up to 2.5 times more force calls per day
than plumed2. Results of five 1{\mu}second-long simulations are presented,
which reveal a conformational switch in the BRD4 inhibitor between a binding
competent and incompetent state. Stabilization of the switch led to a -3
kcal/mol improvement of absolute binding free energy. These studies suggest an
unexplored ligand design principle and offer new actionable hypotheses for
medicinal chemistry efforts against this druggable epigenetic target class.

DNA are inverted, moved, swapped, or even inserted or deleted, have found a

wide range of modelling choices, assumptions and interpretations that make
navigating the literature a significant challenge. Indeed, even authors of
papers that use permutations to model genome rearrangement can struggle to

have been used to model genomes and genome rearrangement events, presenting
some features and limitations of each approach, and show how the various models
are related. This paper will help researchers navigate the landscape of genome
rearrangement models, and make it easier for authors to present clear and

  Deep Learning Neural Networks"	"  Accurate computational identification of promoters remains a challenge as
these key DNA regulatory regions have variable structures composed of
functional motifs that provide gene specific initiation of transcription. In
this paper we utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze sequence
characteristics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic promoters and build their
predictive models. We trained the same CNN architecture on promoters of four
very distant organisms: human, plant (Arabidopsis), and two bacteria
(Escherichia coli and Mycoplasma pneumonia). We found that CNN trained on
sigma70 subclass of Escherichia coli promoter gives an excellent classification
of promoters and non-promoter sequences (Sn=0.90, Sp=0.96, CC=0.84). The
Bacillus subtilis promoters identification CNN model achieves Sn=0.91, Sp=0.95,
and CC=0.86. For human and Arabidopsis promoters we employ CNNs for
identification of two well-known promoter classes (TATA and non-TATA
promoters). CNNs models nicely recognize these complex functional regions. For
human Sn/Sp/CC accuracy of prediction reached 0.95/0.98/0,90 on TATA and
0.90/0.98/0.89 for non-TATA promoter sequences, respectively. For Arabidopsis
we observed Sn/Sp/CC 0.95/0.97/0.91 (TATA) and 0.94/0.94/0.86 (non-TATA)
promoters. Thus, the developed CNN models (implemented in CNNProm program)
demonstrated the ability of deep learning with grasping complex promoter
sequence characteristics and achieve significantly higher accuracy compared to
the previously developed promoter prediction programs. As the suggested
approach does not require knowledge of any specific promoter features, it can
be easily extended to identify promoters and other complex functional regions
in sequences of many other and especially newly sequenced genomes. The CNNProm
program is available to run at web server http://www.softberry.com.

biological processes. In cells, one mechanism to form nanosized lipid tubules
is via molecular motor induced bilayer extraction. In this paper, we describe a
simple experimental model to investigate the forces required for lipid tube
formation using kinesin motors anchored to DOPC vesicles. Previous related
studies have used molecular motors actively pulling on the membrane to extract
a nanotube. Here, we invert the system geometry; molecular motors are used as
static anchors linking DOPC vesicles to a two-dimensional microtubule network
and an external flow is introduced to generate nanotubes facilitated by the
drag force. We found that a drag force of ~7 pN was sufficient for tubule
extraction for vesicles ranging from 1 to 2 um in radius. By our method, we
found that the force generated by a single molecular motor was sufficient for
membrane tubule extraction from a spherical lipid vesicle.

  Interference in Multiple-Motor Transport"	"  Within living cells, the transport of cargo is accomplished by groups of
molecular motors. Such collective transport could utilize mechanisms which
emerge from inter-motor interactions in ways that are yet to be fully
understood. Here we combined experimental measurements of two-kinesin transport
with a theoretical framework to investigate the functional ramifications of
inter-motor interactions on individual motor function and collective cargo
transport. In contrast to kinesin's low sidestepping frequency when present as
a single motor, with exactly two kinesins per cargo, we observed substantial
motion perpendicular to the microtubule. Our model captures a
surface-associated mode of kinesin, which is only accessible via inter-motor
interference in groups, in which kinesin diffuses along the microtubule surface
and rapidly ""hops"" between protofilaments without dissociating from the
microtubule. Critically, each kinesin transitions dynamically between the
active stepping mode and this weak surface-associated mode enhancing local
exploration of the microtubule surface, possibly enabling cellular cargos to
overcome macromolecular crowding and to navigate obstacles along microtubule
tracks without sacrificing overall travel distance.

physiological function or as an adaptive state of inactivity and these
hypotheses remain widely debated. To investigate the adaptive significance of
sleep, we develop an evolutionary argument formulated as a tractable partial
differential equation model. We allow demographic parameters such as birth and
mortality rates to vary through time in both safe and vulnerable sleeping
environments. From this model we analytically calculate population growth rate
(fitness) for sleeping and non-sleeping strategies. We find that, in a
temporally heterogeneous environment, sleeping always achieves a higher fitness
than not sleeping. As organisms do not exist in constant environments, we
conclude that the evolution of sleep is inevitable.

  hydration enabled by the presence of cation"	"  It is known that steric blocking by peptide sidechains of hydrogen bonding,
HB, between water and peptide groups, PGs, in beta sheets accords with an amino
acid intrinsic beta sheet preference. The present observations with Quantum
Molecular Dynamics, QMD, simulation with quantum mechanical treatment of every
water molecule solvating a beta sheet that would be transient in nature suggest
that this steric blocking is not applicable in a hydrophobic region unless a
cation is present, so that the amino acid beta sheet preference due to this
steric blocking is only effective in the presence of a cation. We observed
backbone hydration in a polyalanine and to a lesser extent polyvaline alpha
helix without a cation being present, but a cation could increase the strength
of these HBs.
  Parallel beta sheets have a greater tendency than antiparallel beta sheets of
equivalent small size to retain regular structure in solvated QMD, and a 4
strand 4 inter-PG HB chain parallel beta sheet was used. Stability was
reinforced by one surface being polyvaline, which buttressed the opposite
surface which was used for experimentation. A single Ca2+ ion was used for
investigation of individual binding events rather than bulk properties. No
direct binding between Ca2+ and the PG oxygen was observed in these
simulations, but perhaps it occurs at longer time scales as the transient beta
sheet unfolds.
  When linear scaling QMD methods that are accurate for peptide resonance,
Resonance-Assisted Hydrogen Bonding and the properties of water become
available, more extensive experiments having multiple ions of multiple types
could be performed at acceptable computational cost. It important that such
investigations be performed on protein secondary structures rather than model
amides so that sidechain limitation of backbone hydration and hence intrinsic
amino acid propensity is captured.

ecological information, growth and connectivity on landscape level of
anemochory plant species Abied pindrow, Betula utilis and Taxus wallichiana in
the Western Himalaya region. A network is formally defined and derived for seed
dispersion model of aforementioned species where vertices represent habitat
patches which are connected by an edge if the distance between the patches is
less than a threshold distance. We define centrality of a network and
computationally identify the habitat patches that are central to the process of
seed dispersion to occur across the network. We find that the network of
habitat patches is a scale free network and at the same time it also displays
small world property characterized by high clustering and low average shortest
path length. Due to high clustering, the spread of species is locally even as
seed disperse mutually among the member vertices of a cluster. Also since every
vertex is only a short number of steps away from every other vertex, the
species rapidly covers all the habitat patches in the component. Also due to
presence of hubs in the network the spread of species is greatly boosted
whenever the species establish and thrive in a hub patch and disperse to
adjacent patches. However, the network is not modular due to geographical
constraints, and is is negatively assortative as the high degree vertices are
connected to vertices of low degree.

data suggest a number of mathematical models of neurons. These models range
from entirely descriptive ones to those deduced from the properties of the real
neurons. One of them, the diffusion leaky integrate-and-fire neuronal model,
which is based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process that is restricted
by an absorbing barrier, can describe a wide range of neuronal activity in
terms of its parameters. These parameters are readily associated with known
physiological mechanisms. The other model is descriptive, Gamma renewal
process, and its parameters only reflect the observed experimental data or
assumed theoretical properties. Both of these commonly used models are related
here. We show under which conditions the Gamma model is an output from the
diffusion Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model. In some cases we can see that the Gamma
distribution is unrealistic to be achieved for the employed parameters of the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

  Capsid Assembly"	"  Most of the existing research in assembly pathway prediction/analysis of
virus cap- sids makes the simplifying assumption that the configuration of the
intermediate states can be extracted directly from the final configuration of
the entire capsid. This assump- tion does not take into account the
conformational changes of the constituent proteins as well as minor changes to
the binding interfaces that continues throughout the assembly process until
stabilization. This paper presents a statistical-ensemble based approach which
provides sufficient samples of the configurational space for each monomer and
the relative local orientation between monomers, to capture the uncertainties
in their binding and conformations. Furthermore, instead of using larger
capsomers (trimers, pentamers) as building blocks, we allow all possible
sub-assemblies to bind in all pos- sible combinations. We represent this
assembly graph in two different ways. First, we use the Wilcoxon signed rank
measure to compare the distributions of binding free energy computed on the
sampled conformations to predict likely pathways. Second, we represent chemical
equilibrium aspects of the transitions as a Bayesian Factor graph where both
associations and dissociations are modeled based on concentrations and the
binding free energies. Results from both of these experiments showed
significant departure from those one would obtain if only the static
configurations of the proteins were considered. Hence, we establish the
importance of an uncertainty-aware protocol for pathway analysis, and provide a
statistical framework as an important first step towards assembly pathway
prediction with high statistical confidence.

1610.00661	q-bio	q-bio.QM q-bio.TO	3D hybrid modeling of vascular network formation	"  We develop an agent-based model of vasculogenesis, the de novo formation of
blood vessels. Endothelial cells in the vessel network are viewed as linearly
elastic spheres and are of two types: vessel elements are contained within the
network; tip cells are located at endpoints. Tip cells move in response to
forces due to interactions with neighbouring vessel elements, the local tissue
environment, chemotaxis and a persistence force modeling their tendency to
continue moving in the same direction. Vessel elements experience similar
forces but not chemotaxis. An angular persistence force representing local
tissue interactions stabilises buckling instabilities due to proliferation.
Vessel elements proliferate, at rates that depend on their degree of stretch:
elongated elements proliferate more rapidly than compressed elements. Following
division, new cells are more likely to form new sprouts if the parent vessel is
highly compressed and to be incorporated into the parent vessel if it is
stretched.
  Model simulations reproduce key features of vasculogenesis. Parameter
sensitivity analyses reveal significant changes in network size and morphology
on varying the chemotactic sensitivity of tip cells, and the sensitivities of
the proliferation rate and sprouting probability to mechanical stretch. Varying
chemotactic sensitivity also affects network directionality. Branching and
network density are influenced by the sprouting probability. Glyphs depicting
multiple network properties show how network quantities change over time and as
model parameters vary. We also show how glyphs constructed from in vivo data
could be used to discriminate between normal and tumour vasculature and,
ultimately, for model validation. We conclude that our biomechanical hybrid
model generates vascular networks similar to those generated from in vitro and
in vivo experiments.

  Energy, and Very Slow Walking Gaits"	"  The biomechanics of the human body allow humans a range of possible ways of
executing movements to attain specific goals. This range of movement is limited
by a number of mechanical, biomechanical, or cognitive constraints. Shifts in
these limits result in changes available possible movements from which a
subject can select and can affect which movements a subject selects. Therefore
by understanding the limits on the range of movement we can come to a better
understanding of declines in movement performance due to disease or aging. In
this project, we look at how models for the limits on the range of movement can
be derived in a principled manner from a model of the movement. Using the
example of normal walking gaits, we develop a lower limit on the avg. walking
speed by examining the process by which the body restores mechanical energy
lost during walking, and we develop an upper limit on the avg. step length by
examining the forces the body can exert doing external mechanical work, in this
case, pulling a cart. Making slight changes to the model for normal walking
gaits, we develop a model of very slow walking gaits with avg. walking speeds
below the lower limit on normal walking gaits but that also has a lower limit
on the avg. walking speed. We note that the lowest avg. walking speeds observed
clinically fall into the range of very slow walking gaits so defined, and argue
that forms of bipedal locomotion with still lower speeds should be considered
distinct from walking gaits.

described using the metaphor of a noise filter. Cellular systems need accurate,
real-time data about their environmental conditions, but the biochemical
reaction networks that propagate, amplify, and process signals work with noisy
representations of that data. Biology must implement strategies that not only
filter the noise, but also predict the current state of the environment based
on information delayed due to the finite speed of chemical signaling. The idea
of a biochemical noise filter is actually more than just a metaphor: we
describe recent work that has made an explicit mathematical connection between
signaling fidelity in cellular circuits and the classic theories of optimal
noise filtering and prediction that began with Wiener, Kolmogorov, Shannon, and
Bode. This theoretical framework provides a versatile tool, allowing us to
derive analytical bounds on the maximum mutual information between the
environmental signal and the real-time estimate constructed by the system. It
helps us understand how the structure of a biological network, and the response
times of its components, influences the accuracy of that estimate. The theory
also provides insights into how evolution may have tuned enzyme kinetic

the FBA model by introducing a pseudo reaction constrained by enzymatic
parameters. Our algorithm was able to handle not only prediction of knockout
strains but also strains with quantitative adjustment of expression level or
activity. We first demonstrate the concept by applying HCSA to a simplest
three-node network. Then we validate its prediction by comparing with ODE and
with a synthetic network in Saccharomyces cerevisiae producing voilacein and
analogues. Finally we show its capability of predicting the flux distribution
in genome-scale networks by applying it to the sporulation in yeast.

  systems"	"  Production of chemicals from engineered organisms in a batch culture involves
an inherent trade-off between productivity, yield, and titer. Existing
strategies for strain design typically focus on designing mutations that
achieve the highest yield possible while maintaining growth viability. While
these methods are computationally tractable, an optimum productivity could be
achieved by a dynamic strategy in which the intracellular division of resources
is permitted to change with time. New methods for the design and implementation
of dynamic microbial processes, both computational and experimental, have
therefore been explored to maximize productivity. However, solving for the
optimal metabolic behavior under the assumption that all fluxes in the cell are
free to vary is a challenging numerical task. This work presents an efficient
method for the calculation of a maximum theoretical productivity of a batch
culture system using a dynamic optimization framework. This metric is analogous
to the maximum theoretical yield, a measure that is well established in the
metabolic engineering literature and whose use helps guide strain and pathway
selection. The proposed method follows traditional assumptions of dynamic flux
balance analysis: (1) that internal metabolite fluxes are governed by a
pseudo-steady state, and (2) that external metabolite fluxes are dynamically
bounded. The optimization is achieved via collocation on finite elements, and
accounts explicitly for an arbitrary number of flux changes. The method can be
further extended to explicitly solve for the trade-off curve between maximum
productivity and yield. We demonstrate the method on succinate production in
two common microbial hosts, Escherichia coli and Actinobacillus succinogenes,
revealing that nearly optimal yields and productivities can be achieved with
only two discrete flux stages.

1610.01189	q-bio	q-bio.BM q-bio.QM q-bio.SC	"Quantitative Determination of the Probability of Multiple-Motor
  Transport in Bead-Based Assays"	"  With their longest dimension typically being less than 100 nm, molecular
motors are significantly below the optical-resolution limit. Despite
substantial advances in fluorescence-based imaging methodologies, labeling with
beads remains critical for optical-trapping-based investigations of molecular
motors. A key experimental challenge in bead-based assays is that the number of
motors on a bead is not well defined. Particularly for single-molecule
investigations, the probability of single versus multiple-motor events has not
been experimentally investigated. Here, we used bead travel distance as an
indicator of multiple-motor transport and determined the lower-bound
probability of bead transport by two or more motors. We limited the ATP
concentration to increase our detection sensitivity for multiple- versus
single-kinesin transport. Surprisingly, for all but the lowest motor number
examined, our measurements exceeded estimations of a previous model by R2-fold.
To bridge this apparent gap between theory and experiment, we derived a
closed-form expression for the probability of bead transport by multiple
motors, and constrained the only free parameter in this model using our
experimental measurements. Our data indicate that kinesin extends to ~57 nm
during bead transport, suggesting that kinesin exploits its conformational
flexibility to interact with microtubules at highly curved interfaces such as
those present for vesicle transport in cells. To our knowledge, our findings
provide the first experimentally constrained guide for estimating the
probability of multiple-motor transport in optical trapping studies. The
experimental approach utilized here (limiting ATP concentration) may be
generally applicable to studies in which molecular motors are labeled with
cargos that are artificial or are purified from cellular extracts.

1610.01192	q-bio	q-bio.BM q-bio.SC	Microtubule Defects Influence Kinesin-Based Transport In Vitro	"  Microtubules are protein polymers that form ""molecular highways"" for
long-range transport within living cells. Molecular motors actively step along
microtubules to shuttle cellular materials between the nucleus and the cell
periphery; this transport is critical for the survival and health of all
eukaryotic cells. Structural defects in microtubules exist, but whether these
defects impact molecular motor-based transport remains unknown. Here, we report
a new, to our knowledge, approach that allowed us to directly investigate the
impact of such defects. Using a modified optical-trapping method, we examined
the group function of a major molecular motor, conventional kinesin, when
transporting cargos along individual microtubules. We found that microtubule
defects influence kinesin-based transport in vitro. The effects depend on motor
number: cargos driven by a few motors tended to unbind prematurely from the
microtubule, whereas cargos driven by more motors tended to pause. To our
knowledge, our study provides the first direct link between microtubule defects
and kinesin function. The effects uncovered in our study may have physiological
relevance in vivo.
"
1610.01196	q-bio	q-bio.BM q-bio.SC	Tuning Multiple Motor Travel Via Single Motor Velocity	"  Microtubule-based molecular motors often work in small groups to transport
cargos in cells. A key question in understanding transport (and its regulation
in vivo) is to identify the sensitivity of multiple-motor-based motion to
various single molecule properties. Whereas both single-motor travel distance
and microtubule binding rate have been demonstrated to contribute to cargo
travel, the role of single-motor velocity is yet to be explored. Here, we
recast a previous theoretical study, and make explicit a potential contribution
of velocity to cargo travel. We test this possibility experimentally, and
demonstrate a strong negative correlation between single-motor velocity and
cargo travel for transport driven by two motors. Our study thus discovers a
previously unappreciated role of single-motor velocity in regulating
multiple-motor transport.

1610.01217	q-bio	q-bio.NC	New hallmarks of criticality in recurrent neural networks	"  A rigorous understanding of brain dynamics and function requires a conceptual
bridge between multiple levels of organization, including neural spiking and
network-level population activity. Mounting evidence suggests that neural
networks of cerebral cortex operate at criticality. How operating near this
network state impacts the variability of neuronal spiking is largely unknown.
Here we show in a computational model that two prevalent features of cortical
single-neuron activity, irregular spiking and the decline of response
variability at stimulus onset, are both emergent properties of a recurrent
network operating near criticality. Importantly, our work reveals that the
relation between the irregularity of spiking and the number of input
connections to a neuron, i.e., the in-degree, is maximized at criticality. Our
findings establish criticality as a unifying principle for the variability of
single-neuron spiking and the collective behavior of recurrent circuits in
cerebral cortex.

analysis shows that overall, the oscillations are robust to extrinsic

result in small differences in the frequency and in the amplitude. However, a
combination of analysis and simulation also reveals that the oscillations are
more sensitive to some extrinsic time-scales than to others.

(HCAb). They have many interesting biotechnological and biomedical properties
due to their small size, high solubility and stability, and high affinity and
specificity for their antigens. HCAb and classical IgGs are evolutionary
related and share a common fold. VHHs are composed of regions considered as
constant, called the frameworks (FRs) connected by Complementarity Determining
Regions (CDRs), a highly variable region that provide interaction with the
epitope. Actually, no systematic structural analyses had been performed on VHH
structures despite a significant number of structures. This work is the first
study to analyse the structural diversity of FRs of VHHs. Using a structural
alphabet that allows approximating the local conformation, we show that each of
the four FRs do not have a unique structure but exhibit many structural variant
patterns. Moreover, no direct simple link between the local conformational
change and amino acid composition can be detected. These results indicate that
long-range interactions affect the local conformation of FRs and impact the
building of structural models.

  cells' growth, reproduction and metabolic properties"	"  We consider a general growth mechanism, which acts at cellular level and
above (organs, systems and whole organisms). Using its mathematical
representation, the growth equation, we study the growth and division
mechanisms of amoeba and fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We show how
this mechanism, together with biomolecular machinery, governs growth and
reproduction of cells, and these organisms in particular. This mechanism
provides revealing answers to fundamental questions of biology, like why cells
grow and divide, why and when cells' growth stops. It also sheds light on
questions like why and how life originated and developed. Solving the growth
equation, we obtain analytical expression for the growth curve of fission yeast
as a function of geometrical characteristics and nutrient influxes for RNA and
protein synthesis, and compare the computed growth curves with 85 experiments.
Statistical evaluation shows that these growth curves correspond to
experimental data significantly better than all previous approximations. Also,
using the general growth mechanism, we show how metabolic characteristics of
cells, their size and evolutionary traits relate, considering fission yeast. In
particular, we found that fission yeast S. pombe consumes about 16-18 times
more nutrients for maintenance needs than for biomass synthesis.

  antibiotic resistance in hospitals"	"  Antibiotic-resistant bacteria has posed a grave threat to public health by
causing a number of nosocomial infections in hospitals. Mathematical models
have been used to study the transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria
within a hospital and the measures to control antibiotic resistance in
nosocomial pathogens. Studies presented in \cite{LBL,LB} have shown great value
in understanding the transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a
hospital. However, their results are limited to numerical simulations of a few
different scenarios without analytical analysis of the models in all
biologically feasible parameter regions. Bifurcation analysis and
identification of the global stability conditions are necessary to assess the
interventions which are proposed to limit nosocomial infection and stem the
spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In this paper we study the global
dynamics of the mathematical model of antibiotic resistance in hospitals in
\cite{LBL,LB}. The invasion reproduction number $\mathcal R_{ar}$ of
antibiotic-resistant bacteria is introduced. We give the relationship of
$\mathcal R_{ar}$ and two control reproduction numbers of sensitive bacteria
and resistant bacteria ($\mathcal R_{sc}$ and $\mathcal R_{rc}$). More
importantly, we prove that a backward bifurcation may occur at $\mathcal
R_{ar}=1$ when the model includes superinfection which is not mentioned in
\cite{LB}. That is, there exists a new threshold $\mathcal R_{ar}^c$, and if
$\mathcal R_{ar}^c<\mathcal R_{ar}<1$, then the system can have two interior
equilibria and it supports an interesting bistable phenomenon. This provides
critical information on controlling the antibiotic-resistance in a hospital.

to identify objects in images. Contrary to other saliency models that use deep
features, here we use the VGG features for saliency prediction with no
additional fine-tuning (rather, a few readout layers are trained on top of the
VGG features to predict saliency). The model is therefore a strong test of
transfer learning. After conservative cross-validation, DeepGaze II explains
about 87% of the explainable information gain in the patterns of fixations and
achieves top performance in area under the curve metrics on the MIT300 hold-out
benchmark. These results corroborate the finding from DeepGaze I (which
explained 56% of the explainable information gain), that deep features trained
on object recognition provide a versatile feature space for performing related
visual tasks. We explore the factors that contribute to this success and
present several informative image examples. A web service is available to

a laptop to produce an accurate map of the electric activity inside the brain.
Moreover, it requires very little memory storage. For this reasons the random

accompanied by different kinds of mental content. We review the first-person
report literature on the frequency and type of content experienced in various
stages of sleep, showing that different sleep stages are dissociable at the
subjective level. We then relate these subjective differences to the growing
literature differentiating the various sleep stages at the neurophysiological
level, including evidence from electrophysiology, neurochemistry, and
functional neuroimaging. We suggest that there is emerging evidence for
relationships between sleep stage, neurophysiological activity, and subjective
experiences. Specifically, we emphasize that functional neuroimaging work
suggests a parallel between activation and deactivation of default network and
visual network brain areas and the varying frequency and intensity of imagery
and dream mentation across sleep stages; additionally, frontoparietal control
network activity across sleep stages may parallel levels of cognitive control
and meta-awareness. Together these findings suggest intriguing brain-mind
isomorphisms and may serve as a first step toward a comprehensive understanding
of the relationship between neurophysiology and psychology in sleep and
dreaming.

esophageus, stomach and small intestine of the Nile monitor and processed for
paraffin embedding. Sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin for
general morphology. Periodic Acid Schiff's (PAS) and Alcian Blue (AB) staining
methods were applied to detect the different types of the mucous con-tents of
the gastro-intestinal tract. Some paraffin sections were stained with Grimelius
silver impregnation technique for localization of the enteroendocrine cells.
The folded esophageal mucosa had ciliated columnar epithelium with mucous
secreting goblet cells, which stained positive with PAS and AB. The esophageal
mucosa was folded and the lining epithelium was ciliated columnar epithelium
with mucous secreting goblet cells, which stained positive with PAS and AB. The
stomach was divided into fundic and pyloric regions. The mucosa was thrown into
gastric pits, into which the gastric glands opened. The surface epithelium was
mucous secreting columnar cells and stained positive with PAS but negative with
AB. The fundic gland was made by oxynticopeptic cells and few mucous cells,
while the entire pyloric gland was made by mucous cells stained positive for
both PAS and AB. The small intestine showed many villi but occasional poorly
developed intestinal crypts were. The intestinal mucosa was lined with
absorptive columnar epithelium with goblet cells, which stained positive with
PAS and AB. Enteroendocrine cells were of different shapes; rounded, spindle,
oval or pyramidal and were localized in the surface epithelium of the esophagus
and small intestine, and among the cells of the gastric glands.

dynamical interdependencies underlying various physiologic and pathophysiologic
conditions in the human epileptic brain. We here use approaches from symbolic
analysis to investigate---in a time-resolved manner---weighted and directed,
short- to long-ranged interactions between various brain regions constituting
the epileptic network. Our observations point to complex spatial-temporal

The complex dynamics of such networks has been studied with methods of analysis
from graph theory. In addition to investigating network-specific
characteristics, recent studies aim to determine the functional role of single
nodes---such as the epileptic focus---in epileptic brain networks and their
relationship to ictogenesis. Utilizing the concept of betweenness centrality to
assess the importance of network nodes, previous studies reported the epileptic
focus to be of highest importance prior to seizures, which would support the
notion of a network hub that facilitates seizure activity. We performed a
time-resolved analysis of various aspects of node importance in epileptic brain
networks derived from long-term, multi-channel, intracranial
electroencephalographic recordings from an epilepsy patient. Our preliminary
findings indicate that the epileptic focus is not consistently the most

an explanation for the evolution of cooperation. While the majority of previous
studies equates reputation with a transparent and complete history of players'
past decisions, in real life, reputations are often ambiguous and opaque. Using
web-based experiments, we explore the extent to which opaque reputation works
in isolating defectors, with and without partner selection opportunities. Our
results show that low reputation works as a signal of untrustworthiness,
whereas medium or high reputation are not taken into account by participants
for orienting their choices. We also find that reputation without partner
selection does not promote cooperative behavior; that is, defectors do not turn
into cooperators only for the sake of getting a positive reputation. Finally,
in a third study, we find that, when reputation is pivotal to selection, then a
substantial proportion of would-be-defectors turn into cooperators. Taken
together, these results provide insights on the characteristics of reputation
and on the way in which humans make use of it when selecting partners but also
when knowing that they will be selected.

  Winner-Take-All Networks"	"  We initiate a line of investigation into biological neural networks from an
algorithmic perspective. We develop a simplified but biologically plausible
model for distributed computation in stochastic spiking neural networks and
study tradeoffs between computation time and network complexity in this model.
Our aim is to abstract real neural networks in a way that, while not capturing
all interesting features, preserves high-level behavior and allows us to make
biologically relevant conclusions.
  In this paper, we focus on the important `winner-take-all' (WTA) problem,
which is analogous to a neural leader election unit: a network consisting of
$n$ input neurons and $n$ corresponding output neurons must converge to a state
in which a single output corresponding to a firing input (the `winner') fires,
while all other outputs remain silent. Neural circuits for WTA rely on
inhibitory neurons, which suppress the activity of competing outputs and drive
the network towards a converged state with a single firing winner. We attempt
to understand how the number of inhibitors used affects network convergence
time.
  We show that it is possible to significantly outperform naive WTA
constructions through a more refined use of inhibition, solving the problem in
$O(\theta)$ rounds in expectation with just $O(\log^{1/\theta} n)$ inhibitors
for any $\theta$. An alternative construction gives convergence in
$O(\log^{1/\theta} n)$ rounds with $O(\theta)$ inhibitors. We compliment these
upper bounds with our main technical contribution, a nearly matching lower
bound for networks using $\ge \log\log n$ inhibitors. Our lower bound uses
familiar indistinguishability and locality arguments from distributed computing
theory. It lets us derive a number of interesting conclusions about the
structure of any network solving WTA with good probability, and the use of
randomness and inhibition within such a network.

propulsion depending on the environment in which they find themselves. One mode
is swimming by blebbing or other shape changes, and in this paper we analyze a
class of models for movement of cells by blebbing and of nano- robots in a
viscous fluid at low Reynolds number. At the level of individuals, the shape
changes comprise volume exchanges between connected spheres that can control
their separation, which are simple enough that significant analytical results
can be obtained. The goal is to understand how the efficiency of move- ment
depends on the amplitude and period of the volume exchanges when the spheres
approach closely during a cycle. Previous analyses were predicated on wide
separation, and we show that the speed in- creases significantly as the
separation decreases due to the strong hydrodynamic interactions between
spheres in close proximity. The scallop theorem asserts that at least two
degrees of freedom are needed to produce net motion in a cyclic sequence of
shape changes, and we show that these degrees can reside in different swimmers
whose collective motion is studied. We also show that different combinations of
mode sharing can lead to significant differences in the translation and
performance of pairs of swimmers.

via the balancing of the mesoscale drag forces and couples with the micro-scale

  viral and bacterial diseases"	"  After birth setting up an effective immune system is a major challenge for
all living organisms. In this paper we show that this process can be explored
by using the age-specific infant death rate as a kind of sensor. This is made
possible because, as shown by the authors in Berrut et al. (2016), between
birth and a critical age t_c, for all mammals the death rate decreases with age
as an hyperbolic function. For humans t_c is equal to 10 years. At some ages
the hyperbolic fall displays spikes which, it is assumed, correspond to
specific events in the organism's response to exogenous factors. One of these
spikes occurs 10 days after birth and there is another at the age of about 300
days. It is shown that the first spike is related to viral infections whereas
the second is related to bacterial diseases. By going back to former time
periods during which infant mortality was much higher than currently, it is
possible to get a magnified view of these peaks which in turn may give us
useful information about how an organism adapts to new conditions. Apart from
pathogens, the same methodology can be used to study the response to changes in

1610.02227	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Geometric-optical illusions and Riemannian geometry	"  Geometric-optical illusions (GOI) are a subclass of a vast variety of visual
illusions. A special class of GOIs originates from the superposition of a
simple geometric figure (""target"") with an array of non-intersecting
curvilinear elements (""context"") that elicits a perceptual distortion of the
target element. Here we specifically deal with the case of circular targets.
Starting from the fact that (half)circles are geodesics in a model of
hyperbolic geometry, we conceive of the deformations of the target as resulting
from a context-induced perturbation of that ""base"" geometry. We present
computational methods for predicting distorted shapes of the target in
different contexts, and we report the results of a psychophysical pilot
experiment with eight subjects and four contexts to test the predictions.
Finally, we propose a common scheme for modeling GOIs associated with more
general types of target curves, subsuming those studied previously.

  Simulation with High Performance Computers"	"  Stochastic, spatial reaction-diffusion simulations have been widely used in
systems biology and computational neuroscience. However, the increasing scale
and complexity of simulated models and morphologies have exceeded the capacity
of any serial implementation. This led to development of parallel solutions
that benefit from the boost in performance of modern large-scale
supercomputers. In this paper, we describe an MPI-based, parallel
Operator-Splitting implementation for stochastic spatial reaction-diffusion
simulations with irregular tetrahedral meshes. The performance of our
implementation is first examined and analyzed with simulations of a simple
model. We then demonstrate its usage in real-world research by simulating the
reaction-diffusion components of a published calcium burst model in both
Purkinje neuron sub-branch and full dendrite morphologies. Simulation results
indicate that our implementation is capable of achieving super-linear speedup
for balanced loading simulations with reasonable molecule density and mesh
quality. In the best scenario a parallel simulation with 2000 processes
achieves more than 3600 times of speedup relative to its serial SSA counterpart
and more than 20 times of speedup relative to parallel simulation with 100
processes. While simulation performance is affected by unbalanced loading, a
substantial speedup can still be observed without any special treatment.

1610.02281	q-bio	q-bio.GN cs.CE cs.LG	"Effective Classification of MicroRNA Precursors Using Combinatorial
  Feature Mining and AdaBoost Algorithms"	"  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs with approximately 22 nucleotides (nt)
that are derived from precursor molecules. These precursor molecules or
pre-miRNAs often fold into stem-loop hairpin structures. However, a large
number of sequences with pre-miRNA-like hairpins can be found in genomes. It is
a challenge to distinguish the real pre-miRNAs from other hairpin sequences
with similar stem-loops (referred to as pseudo pre-miRNAs). Several
computational methods have been developed to tackle this challenge. In this
paper we propose a new method, called MirID, for identifying and classifying
microRNA precursors. We collect 74 features from the sequences and secondary
structures of pre-miRNAs; some of these features are taken from our previous
studies on non-coding RNA prediction while others were suggested in the
literature. We develop a combinatorial feature mining algorithm to identify
suitable feature sets. These feature sets are then used to train support vector
machines to obtain classification models, based on which classifier ensemble is
constructed. Finally we use an AdaBoost algorithm to further enhance the
accuracy of the classifier ensemble. Experimental results on a variety of
species demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method, and its
superiority over existing tools.

  filamentous cyanobacteria"	"  Cyanobacteria forming one-dimensional filaments are paradigmatic model
organisms of the transition between unicellular and multicellular living forms.
Under nitrogen limiting conditions, in filaments of the genus Anabaena, some
cells differentiate into heterocysts, which lose the possibility to divide but
are able to fix environmental nitrogen for the colony. These heterocysts form a
quasi-regular pattern in the filament, representing a prototype of patterning
and morphogenesis in prokaryotes. Recent years have seen advances in the
identification of the molecular mechanism regulating this pattern. We use this
data to build a theory on heterocyst pattern formation, for which both genetic
regulation and the effects of cell division and filament growth are key
components. The theory is based on the interplay of three generic mechanisms:
local autoactivation, early long range inhibition, and late long range
inhibition. These mechanisms can be identified with the dynamics of hetR, patS
and hetN expression. Our theory reproduces quantitatively the experimental
dynamics of pattern formation and maintenance for wild type and mutants. We
find that hetN alone is not enough to play the role as the late inhibitory
mechanism: a second mechanism, hypothetically the products of nitrogen fixation
supplied by heterocysts, must also play a role in late long range inhibition.
The preponderance of even intervals between heterocysts arises naturally as a
result of the interplay between the timescales of genetic regulation and cell
division. We also find that a purely stochastic initiation of the pattern,
without a two-stage process, is enough to reproduce experimental observations.

worldview precludes free will in the libertarian sense. On the one hand, the
paradigm of classical mechanics makes determinism inescapable, while on the
other, the leading models that allow a role for quantum effects are
noncommittal regarding how conscious agents are supposed to translate
indeterminacy into self-formed choice. Recent developments, however, not only
imply that self-formed decisions are possible, but actually suggest how they
might come about. The cornerstone appears to be causality superposition rather
than quantum-state entanglement, as is usually assumed, and the natural arena
for applying these developments is (perhaps ironically) a framework that was
built without any consideration for quantum effects.

1610.02448	q-bio	physics.soc-ph physics.data-an q-bio.OT	A topological approach to the problem of emergence in complex systems	"  Emergent patterns in complex systems are related to many intriguing phenomena
in modern science and philosophy. Several conceptions such as weak, strong and
robust emergence have been proposed to emphasize different epistemological and
ontological aspects of the problem. One of the most important concerns is
whether emergence is an intrinsic property of the reality we observe, or it is
rather a consequence of epistemological limitations. To elucidate this
question, we propose a novel approximation through constructive topology, a
framework that allow us to map the space of observed objects (ontology) with
the knowledge subject conceptual apparatus (epistemology). Focusing in a
particular type of emergent processes, namely those accessible through
experiments and from which we have still no clue on the mechanistic processes
yielding its formation, we analyse how a knowledge subject would build a
conceptual explanatory framework. Working on these systems, we identify concept
disjunction as a critical logical operation needed to identify the constraints
of the system. Next, focusing on a three-bits synthetic system, we show how the
number and scope of the constraints hinder the development of such scheme.
Interestingly, we observe that our framework is unable to identify global
constraints, clearly linking the epistemological limits of the framework with
an ontological feature of the system. This allows us to propose a definition of
emergence strength which we make compatible with the scientific method through
the active intervention of the observer on the system. We think that this
definition reconciles previous attempts to classify emergent processes, at
least for the specific kind we discuss here. The paper finishes discussing the
relevance of global constraints in biological systems, understood as a downward
causal influence exerted by natural selection.

my academic view of creativity, but I believe that the influence works
primarily in the other direction, my understanding of how the creative process
works is derived from experiences creating. This intuitive understanding is
shaped over time by the process of reading scholarly papers on creativity and

  Systems"	"  This paper presents NetWorks (NW), an interactive music generation system
that uses a hierarchically clustered scale free network to generate music that
ranges from orderly to chaotic. NW was inspired by the Honing Theory of
creativity, according to which human-like creativity hinges on (1) the ability
to self-organize and maintain dynamics at the 'edge of chaos' using something
akin to 'psychological entropy', and (2) the capacity to shift between analytic
and associative processing modes. At the 'edge of chaos', NW generates patterns
that exhibit emergent complexity through coherent development at low, mid, and
high levels of musical organization, and often suggests goal seeking behaviour.
The architecture consists of four 16-node modules: one each for pitch,
velocity, duration, and entry delay. The Core allows users to define how nodes
are connected, and rules that determine when and how nodes respond to their
inputs. The Mapping Layer allows users to map node output values to MIDI data
that is routed to software instruments in a digital audio workstation. By
shifting between bottom-up and top-down NW shifts between analytic and
associative processing modes.

1610.02484	q-bio	q-bio.NC physics.soc-ph	Honing Theory: A Complex Systems Framework for Creativity	"  This paper proposes a theory of creativity, referred to as honing theory,
which posits that creativity fuels the process by which culture evolves through
communal exchange amongst minds that are self-organizing, self-maintaining, and
self-reproducing. According to honing theory, minds, like other selforganizing
systems, modify their contents and adapt to their environments to minimize
entropy. Creativity begins with detection of high psychological entropy
material, which provokes uncertainty and is arousalinducing. The creative
process involves recursively considering this material from new contexts until
it is sufficiently restructured that arousal dissipates. Restructuring involves
neural synchrony and dynamic binding, and may be facilitated by temporarily
shifting to a more associative mode of thought. A creative work may similarly
induce restructuring in others, and thereby contribute to the cultural
evolution of more nuanced worldviews. Since lines of cultural descent
connecting creative outputs may exhibit little continuity, it is proposed that
cultural evolution occurs at the level of self-organizing minds, outputs
reflect their evolutionary state. Honing theory addresses challenges not
addressed by other theories of creativity, such as the factors that guide
restructuring, and in what sense creative works evolve. Evidence comes from
empirical studies, an agent-based computational model of cultural evolution,
and a model of concept combination.

  Organoids in Models of Neurodevelopment and Tissue Regeneration"	"  Biomaterials are becoming an essential tool in the study and application of
stem cell research. Various types of biomaterials enable three-dimensional (3D)
culture of stem cells, and, more recently, also enable high-resolution
patterning and organization of multicellular architectures. Biomaterials also
hold potential to provide many additional advantages over cell transplants
alone in regenerative medicine. This paper describes novel designs for
functionalized biomaterial constructs that guide tissue development to targeted
regional identities and structures. Such designs comprise compartmentalized
regions in the biomaterial structure that are functionalized with molecular
factors that form concentration gradients through the construct and guide stem
cell development, axis patterning, and tissue architecture, including
rostral/caudal, ventral/dorsal, or medial/lateral identities of the central
nervous system. The ability to recapitulate innate developmental processes in a
3D environment and under specific controlled conditions has vital application
to advanced models of neurodevelopment and for repair of specific sites of
damaged or diseased neural tissue.

1610.02548	q-bio	q-bio.NC stat.AP	"Exploring brain transcriptomic patterns: a topological analysis using
  spatial expression networks"	"  Characterizing the transcriptome architecture of the human brain is
fundamental in gaining an understanding of brain function and disease. A number
of recent studies have investigated patterns of brain gene expression obtained
from an extensive anatomical coverage across the entire human brain using
experimental data generated by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) project. In
this paper, we propose a new representation of a gene's transcription activity
that explicitly captures the pattern of spatial co-expression across different
anatomical brain regions. For each gene, we define a Spatial Expression Network
(SEN), a network quantifying co-expression patterns amongst several anatomical
locations. Network similarity measures are then employed to quantify the
topological resemblance between pairs of SENs and identify naturally occurring
clusters. Using network-theoretical measures, three large clusters have been
detected featuring distinct topological properties. We then evaluate whether
topological diversity of the SENs reflects significant differences in
biological function through a gene ontology analysis. We report on evidence
suggesting that one of the three SEN clusters consists of genes specifically
involved in the nervous system, including genes related to brain disorders,
while the remaining two clusters are representative of immunity, transcription
and translation. These findings are consistent with previous studies showing
that brain gene clusters are generally associated with one of these three major
biological processes.

1610.02584	q-bio	q-bio.CB q-bio.TO	"Perspectives on the mathematics of biological patterning and
  morphogenesis"	"  A central question in developmental biology is how size and position are
determined. The genetic code carries instructions on how to control these
properties in order to regulate the pattern and morphology of structures in the
developing organism. Transcription and protein translation mechanisms implement
these instructions. However, this cannot happen without some manner of sampling
of epigenetic information on the current patterns and morphological forms of
structures in the organism. Any rigorous description of space- and time-varying
patterns and morphological forms reduces to one among various classes of
spatio-temporal partial differential equations. Reaction-transport equations
represent one such class. Starting from simple Fickian diffusion, the
incorporation of reaction, phase segregation and advection terms can represent
many of the patterns seen in the animal and plant kingdoms. Morphological form,
requiring the development of three-dimensional structure, also can be
represented by these equations of mass transport, albeit to a limited degree.
The recognition that physical forces play controlling roles in shaping tissues
leads to the conclusion that (nonlinear) elasticity governs the development of
morphological form. In this setting, inhomogeneous growth drives the elasticity
problem. The combination of reaction-transport equations with those of
elasto-growth makes accessible a potentially unlimited spectrum of patterning
and morphogenetic phenomena in developmental biology. This perspective
communication is a survey of the partial differential equations of mathematical
physics that have been proposed to govern patterning and morphogenesis in
developmental biology. Several numerical examples are included to illustrate
these equations and the corresponding physics, with the intention of providing
physical insight wherever possible.

jointly Gaussian -- which they tend to be in large networks -- we obtain
deterministic equations for the temporal evolution of the mean firing rates and
the noise covariance matrix that can be solved straightforwardly given the
network connectivity. We also obtain spike count statistics such as Fano
factors and pairwise correlations, assuming doubly-stochastic action potential
firing. Importantly, our theory does not require fluctuations to be small, and
works for several biologically motivated, convex single-neuron nonlinearities.

1610.03217	q-bio	q-bio.PE q-bio.QM	A Corrected Parsimony Criterion for Reconstructing Phylogenies	"  In phylogenetic analysis, for non-molecular data, particularly morphology,
parsimony optimization is the most commonly employed approach. In the past and
present application of the parsimony principle, extra step numbers have been
added across different characters without proper justification. This practice,
however, has caused the impacts of characters to be inflated or deflated
without a valid reason. To resolve this methodological deficiency, here I
present a corrected parsimony criterion for reconstructing phylogenies. In
essence, character rather than step is the most fundamental unit. Accordingly,
the most parsimonious tree should maximize the sum or average of the
phylogenetic signals, quantified by retention index, contributed by each
character. Assigning proper weights to characters is a separate task that
requires information other than the intra-character step number changing range.

1610.03238	q-bio	cond-mat.soft q-bio.CB	Elastohydrodynamic Synchronization of Adjacent Beating Flagella	"  It is now well established that nearby beating pairs of eukaryotic flagella
or cilia typically synchronize in phase. A substantial body of evidence
supports the hypothesis that hydrodynamic coupling between the active
filaments, combined with waveform compliance, provides a robust mechanism for
synchrony. This elastohydrodynamic mechanism has been incorporated into
`bead-spring' models in which flagella are represented by microspheres tethered
by radial springs as internal forces drive them about orbits. While these
low-dimensional models reproduce the phenomenon of synchrony, their parameters
are not readily relatable to those of flagella. More realistic models which
reflect the elasticity of the axonemes and active force generation take the
form of fourth-order nonlinear PDEs. While computational studies have shown
synchrony, the effects of hydrodynamic coupling between nearby filaments
governed by such models have been theoretically examined only in the regime of
interflagellar distances $d$ large compared to flagellar length $L$. Yet, in
many biological situations $d/L \ll 1$. Here, we first present an asymptotic
analysis of the hydrodynamic coupling between two filaments in the regime $d/L
\ll 1$, and find that the form of the coupling is independent of the details of
the internal forces that govern the motion of the filaments. The analysis is
like the localized induction approximation for vortex filament motion, extended
to the case of mutual induction. To understand how the coupling mechanism leads
to synchrony of extended objects, we introduce a heuristic model of flagellar
beating, a single fourth-order nonlinear PDE whose form is derived from
symmetry considerations, the physics of elasticity, and the overdamped nature
of the dynamics. Analytical and numerical studies of this model illustrate how
synchrony between two filaments is achieved through the asymptotic coupling.

sequence with a very high mean coverage in order to make sure that all parts of
the sample DNA get covered by the reads produced. This leads to huge datasets
with lots of redundant data. A filtering of this data prior to assembly is
advisable. Titus Brown et al. (2012) presented the algorithm Diginorm for this
purpose, which filters reads based on the abundance of their $k$-mers. We
present Bignorm, a faster and quality-conscious read filtering algorithm. An
important new feature is the use of phred quality scores together with a
detailed analysis of the $k$-mer counts to decide which reads to keep. With
recommended parameters, in terms of median we remove 97.15% of the reads while
keeping the mean phred score of the filtered dataset high. Using the SDAdes
assembler, we produce assemblies of high quality from these filtered datasets
in a fraction of the time needed for an assembly from the datasets filtered
with Diginorm. We conclude that read filtering is a practical method for
reducing read data and for speeding up the assembly process. Our Bignorm
algorithm allows assemblies of competitive quality in comparison to Diginorm,
while being much faster. Bignorm is available for download at

global challenge for the 21st Century both in terms of providing food for
humankind and to preserve the oceans ecosystems. However, fishing is a complex
economic activity, affected not just by overfishing but also by such factors as
pollution, technology, financial factors and more. For this reason, it is often
difficult to state with complete certainty that overfishing is the cause of the
decline of a fishery. In this study, we developed a simple dynamic model based
on the earlier, well-known Lotka-Volterra model or Prey-Predator model. To
describe exploitation patterns, we assume that the fish stock and the fishing
industry are coupled stock variables in the model and they dynamically affect
each other, with the fishing yield proportional to both the fishing capital and
the fish stock. The model is based on the concept that the fishing industry
acts as the predator of the resource and that its growth and subsequent decline
is directly related to the abundance of the fish stock. If the model can be fit
historical data relative to specific fisheries, then it is a strong indication
that the fishing industry is strongly affected by the magnitude of the fish
stock and that, in particular, the decline of the yield and the decline of the
stock are linked to each other. The model does not pretend to be a general
description of the fishing industry in all its varied forms; however, the data
reported here show that the model can indeed qualitatively describe several
historical case of the collapse of fisheries. The model can also be used as a
qualitative guide to understand the behavior of several other fisheries. These
result indicate that one of the main factors causing the present crisis of the
world's fisheries is the overexploitation of the fish stocks.

cooperator and defector strategies. But in real life situations the group
formation of players could be more sophisticated because not all players are
attractive enough for others to participate in a joint venture. What if only
those players can initiate a group formation and establish a game who are
successful enough to the neighbors? To elaborate this idea we employ a modified
protocol and demonstrate that a carefully chosen threshold to establish joint
venture could efficiently improve the cooperation level even if the synergy
factor would suggest a full defector state otherwise. The microscopic mechanism
which is responsible for this effect is based on the asymmetric consequences of
competing strategies: while the success of a cooperator provides a long-time
well-being for the neighborhood, the temporary advantage of defection cannot be
maintained if the protocol is based on the success of leaders.

systems, including the heart, where they initiate cardiac contraction. Such
waves can form vortices called scroll waves, which result in the onset of
life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The dynamics of scroll waves is affected
by the presence of inhomogeneities, which, in a very general way, can be of
\textit{(i)} ionic type, i.e., they affect the reaction part, or \textit{(ii)}
conduction type, i.e., they affect the diffusion part of an RD equation. We
demostrate, for the first time, by using a state-of-the-art, anatomically
realistic model of the pig heart, how differences in the geometrical and
biophysical nature of such inhomogeneities can influence scroll-wave dynamics
in different ways. Our study reveals that conduction-type inhomogeneities
become increasingly important at small length scales, i.e., in the case of
multiple, randomly distributed, obstacles in space at the cellular scale
($0.2-0.4{\rm mm}$). Such configurations can lead to scroll-wave break up. In
contrast, ionic inhomogeneities, affect scroll-wave dynamics significantly at
large length scales, when these inhomogeneities are localized in space at the
tissue level ($5-10$ mm). In such configurations, these inhomogeneities can (a)
attract scroll waves, by pinning them to the heterogeneity, or (b) lead to
scroll-wave breakup.

roughly 25% of human cases due to influenza B. Influenza B is a single-stranded
RNA virus with a high mutation rate, and both prior immune history and
vaccination put significant pressure on the virus to evolve. Due to the high
rate of viral evolution, the influenza B vaccine component of the annual
influenza vaccine is updated, roughly every other year in recent years. To
predict when an update to the vaccine is needed, an estimate of expected
vaccine effectiveness against a range of viral strains is required. We here
introduce a method to measure antigenic distance between the influenza B
vaccine and circulating viral strains. The measure correlates well with
effectiveness of the influenza B component of the annual vaccine in humans
between 1979 and 2014. We discuss how this measure of antigenic distance may be
used in the context of annual influenza vaccine design and prediction of
vaccine effectiveness.

  choice"	"  The males of the specie of frogs Engystomops pustulosus produce simple and
com- plex calls to lure females, as a way of Intersexual selection. Complex
calls lead males to a greater reproductive success than simple calls do.
However, the complex calls are also more attractive to the main predator of
these amphibians, the bat Trachops cirrhosus. Therefore, as M. Ryan suggests,
the complexity of the calls let the frogs keep a trade off between reproductive
success and predation. In this paper, we first propose to model the proportion
of simple to complex calls as a symmetric game of two strategies. We also
propose a model with three strategies (simple callers, complex callers and
quiet males), where we assess the effect of a male that keeps quiet and
intercepts females, which would play a role of Intrasexual selection. We
analyze the stable points of the replicator equations of the models that we
propose. Under the assumption that the decision of the males takes into account
this trade off between reproductive success and predation, our model reproduces
the observed behavior reported in the literature with minimal assumption on the
parameters. From the three strategies model, we verify that the quiet strategy
could only coexists with the simple and complex strategies as long as the rate
at which quiet males intercept females is high. We conclude that the
reproductive strategy of the male frog Engystomops pustulosus is rational.

ways to sample that transition kernel, including a first-principles derivation
of exact stochastic simulation algorithms (SSA) in continuous time. This

flow model (RFM) with pool was introduced recently. This model describes the
movement of several ribosomes along an mRNA template and simultaneously
captures the dynamics of the finite pool of ribosomes. Studying this system
with respect to the number and stability of its equilibria was so far based on
monotone systems theory (Margaliot and Tuller, 2012). We extend the results
obtained therein by using a geometric approach, showing that the equilibria of
the system constitute a normally hyperbolic invariant submanifold.
Subsequently, we analyze the Jacobi linearization of the system evaluated at
the equilibria in order to show that the equilibria are asymptotically stable
relative to certain affine subspaces. As this approach does not require any
monotonicity features of the system, it may also be applied for more complex
systems of the same kind such as bi-directional ribosome flows or time-varying
template numbers.

limited resources. We present such a novel protein synthesis model which
originates from the Ribosome Flow Model and among other things describes the
movement of RNA-polymerase and Ribosomes on mRNA and DNA templates
respectively. By analyzing the convergence properties of this model based upon

how this model can be used to evaluate the performance of synthetic gene

1610.04078	q-bio	stat.ME q-bio.GN	"A Unified Model for Differential Expression Analysis of RNA-seq Data via
  L1-Penalized Linear Regression"	"  The RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is becoming increasingly popular for quantifying
gene expression levels. Since the RNA-seq measurements are relative in nature,
between-sample normalization of counts is an essential step in differential
expression (DE) analysis. The normalization of existing DE detection algorithms
is ad hoc and performed once for all prior to DE detection, which may be
suboptimal since ideally normalization should be based on non-DE genes only and
thus coupled with DE detection. We propose a unified statistical model for
joint normalization and DE detection of log-transformed RNA-seq data.
Sample-specific normalization factors are modeled as unknown parameters in the
gene-wise linear models and jointly estimated with the regression coefficients.
By imposing sparsity-inducing L1 penalty (or mixed L1/L2-norm for multiple
treatment conditions) on the regression coefficients, we formulate the problem
as a penalized least-squares regression problem and apply the augmented
lagrangian method to solve it. Simulation studies show that the proposed model
and algorithms outperform existing methods in terms of detection power and
false-positive rate when more than half of the genes are differentially
expressed and/or when the up- and down-regulated genes among DE genes are
unbalanced in amount.

often rely on functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, a widely adopted technique
that makes use of a pipeline of data processing modules, each involving a
variety of parameters. These parameters are frequently set according to the
local goal of each specific module, not accounting for the rest of the
pipeline. Given recent success of neural network research in many different
domains, we propose to convert the whole data pipeline into a deep neural
network, where the parameters involved are jointly optimised by the network to
best serve a common global goal. As a proof of concept, we develop a module
able to adaptively apply the most suitable spatial smoothing to every brain
volume for each specific neuroimaging task, and we validate its results in a
standard brain decoding experiment.

1610.04089	q-bio	q-bio.TO math.DS	"New Insights into Initiation of Colon and Intestinal Cancer: The
  Significance of Central Stem Cells in the Crypt"	"  Rapidly dividing tissues, like intestinal crypts, are frequently chosen to
investigate the process of tumor initiation, because of their high rate of
mutations. To study the interplay between normal and mutant as well as immortal
cells in the human colon or intestinal crypt, we developed a 4-compartmental
stochastic model for cell dynamics based on current discoveries. Recent studies
of the intestinal crypt have revealed the existence of two stem cell groups.
Therefore, our model incorporates two stem cell groups (central stem cells
(CeSCs) and border stem cells (BSCs)), plus one compartment for transit
amplifying (TA) cells and one compartment of fully differentiated (FD) cells.
However, it can be easily modified to have only one stem cell group. We find
that the worst-case scenario occurs when CeSCs are mutated, or an immortal cell
arises in the TA or FD compartments. The probability that the progeny of a
single advantageous CeSC mutant will take over the entire crypt is more than
$0.2$, and one immortal cell always causes all FD cells to become
immortals.Moreover, when CeSCs are either mutants or wild-type (w.t.)
individuals, their progeny will take over the entire crypt in less than 100
days if there is no immortal cell. Unexpectedly, if the CeSCs are wild-type,
then non-immortal mutants with higher fitness are washed out faster than those
with lower fitness. Therefore, we suggest one potential treatment for colon
cancer might be replacing or altering the CeSCs with the normal stem cells.

  Structure, and Functionality"	"  Here we review the development of protein scaling theory, starting from
backgrounds in mathematics and statistical mechanics, and leading to biomedical
applications. Evolution has organized each protein family in different ways,
but scaling theory is both simple and effective in providing readily
transferable dynamical insights complementary for many proteins represented in
the 90 thousand static structures contained in the online Protein Data Base
(PDB). Scaling theory is a simplifying magic wand that enables one to search
the hundreds of millions of protein articles in the Web of Science, and
identify those proteins that present new cost-effective methods for early
detection and/or treatment of disease through individual protein sequences
(personalized medicine). Critical point theory is general, and recently it has
proved to be the most effective way of describing protein networks that have
evolved towards nearly perfect functionality in given environments
(self-organized criticality). Evolutionary patterns are governed by common
scaling principles, which can be quantified using scales that have been
developed bioinformatically by studying thousands of PDB structures. The most
effective scales involve either hydropathic globular sculpting interactions
averaged over length scales centered on membrane dimensions, or exposed beta
strand propensities associated with aggregative (strong) protein-protein
interactions.

  natural nanotube"	"  A simple theory of ion permeation through a channel is presented, in which
diffusion occurs according to Fick's law and drift according to Ohm's law, in
the electric field determined by all the charges present. This theory accounts
for permeation in the channels studied to date in a wide range of solutions.
Interestingly, the theory works because the shape of the electric field is a
sensitive function of experimental conditions, e.g., ion concentration. Rate
constants for flux are sensitive functions of ionic concentration because the
fixed charge of the channel protein is shielded by the ions in an near it. Such
shielding effects are not included in traditional theories of ionic channels,
or other proteins, for that matter.

1610.04160	q-bio	q-bio.GN	Pan-genome Analysis of the Genus Serratia	"  Pan-genome analysis is a standard procedure to decipher genome heterogeneity
and diversification of bacterial species. Specie evolution is traced by
defining and comparing the core (conserved), accessory (dispensable) and unique
(strain-specific) gene pool with other strains of interest. Here, we present
pan-genome analysis of the genus Serratia, comprising of a dataset of 100
genomes. The isolates have clinical to environmental origin and consist of ten
different species from the genus, along with two subspecies of the
representative strain Serratia marcescens. Out of 19430 non-redundant coding
DNA sequences (CDS) from the dataset, 972 (5%) belonged to the core genome.
Majority of these genes were linked to metabolic function, followed by cellular
processes/signalling, information storage/processing while rest of them were
poorly characterized. 10,135 CDSs (52.16%) were associated with dispensible
genome while 8,321 CDSs (42.82%) were singletons or strain specific. The
Pan-genome orthologs indicated a positive correlation to the number of genomes
whereas negative correlation was obtained for core genome. Genomes were aligned
to obtain information about synteny, insertion/inversion, deletion and
duplications. This study provides insights into variation of Serratia species
and paves way for pan-genome analysis of other bacterial species at genus
level.

1610.04201	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Parallel ICA reveals linked patterns of structural damage and fMRI
  language task activation in chronic post-stroke aphasia"	"  Structural and functional MRI studies of patients with post-stroke language
deficits have contributed substantially to our understanding of how
cognitive-behavioral impairments relate to the location of structural damage
and to the activation of surviving brain regions during language processing,
respectively. However, very little is known about how inter-patient variability
in language task activation relates to variability in the structures affected
by stroke. Here, we used parallel independent component analysis (pICA) to
characterize links between patterns of structural damage and patterns of
functional MRI activation during semantic decisions. The pICA analysis revealed
a significant association between a lesion component featuring damage to left
posterior temporo-parietal cortex and the underlying deep white matter and an
fMRI component featuring (1) heightened activation in a primarily right
hemispheric network of frontal, temporal, and parietal regions, and (2) reduced
activation in areas associated with the semantic network activated by healthy
controls. Stronger loading parameters on both the lesion and fMRI activation
components were associated with poorer language test performance. Fiber
tracking suggests that lesions affecting the left posterior temporo-parietal
cortex and deep white matter may lead to the simultaneous disruption of
multiple long-range structural pathways connecting distal language areas.
Damage to the left posterior temporo-parietal cortex and underlying white
matter may (1) impede the language task-driven recruitment of canonical left
hemispheric language and other areas (e.g. the right anterior temporal lobe and
default mode regions) that likely support residual language function after
stroke, and (2) lead to the compensatory recruitment of right hemispheric
fronto-temporo-parietal networks for tasks requiring semantic processing.

such as inflammatory response, wound healing, cancer metastasis and
embryogenesis. These are biological demonstrations of the unjamming transition.
However, contradictory to the typical density-driven jamming processes in
particulate assemblies, cellular systems often get unjammed in highly packed,
sometimes overcrowding tissue environments. In this work, we report that
overcrowding can unjam gap-free monolayers through increasing isotropic
compression. The transition boundary is determined by the isotropic compression
and the cell-cell adhesion. We explicitly construct the free energy landscape
for the T1 topological transition during monolayer rearrangement, and find that
it evolves from single-barrier shape to double-barrier shape upon completion of
the unjamming process. Our analyses reveal that the overcrowding and adhesion
induced unjamming transition reflects the mechanical yielding of the highly
deformable monolayer, which differs from those caused by loosing up a packed
particulate assembly.

1610.04255	q-bio	q-bio.NC	The Influence of Streamlined Music on Cognition and Mood	"  Recent advances in sound engineering have led to the development of so-called
streamlined music designed to reduce exogenous attention and improve endogenous
attention. Although anecdotal reports suggest that streamlined music does
indeed improve focus on daily work tasks and may improve mood, the specific
influences of streamlined music on cognition and mood have yet to be examined.
In this paper, we report the results of a series of online experiments that
examined the impact of one form of streamlined music on cognition and mood. The
tested form of streamlined music, which was tested primarily by listeners who
felt they benefited from this type of music, significantly outperformed plain
music on measures of perceived focus, task persistence, precognition, and
creative thinking, with borderline effects on mood. In contrast, this same form
of streamlined music did not significantly influence measures assessing visual
attention, verbal memory, logical thinking, self-efficacy, perceived stress, or
self-transcendence. We also found that improvements in perceived focus over a
2-month period were correlated with improvements in emotional state, including
mood. Overall the results suggest that at least for individuals who enjoy using
streamlined music as a focus tool, streamlined music can have a beneficial
impact on cognition without any obvious costs, while at the same time it may
potentially boost mood.

  of folded and neurotoxic proteins"	"  Knots in proteins have been proposed to resist proteasomal degradation. Ample
evidence associates proteasomal degradation with neurodegeneration. One
interesting possibility is that indeed knotted conformers stall this machinery
leading to toxicity. However, although the proteasome is known to unfold
mechanically its substrates, at present there are no experimental methods to
emulate this particular traction geometry. Here, we consider several dynamical
models of the proteasome in which the complex is represented by an effective
potential with an added pulling force. This force is meant to induce
translocation of a protein or a polypeptide into the catalytic chamber. The
force is either constant or applied periodically. The translocated proteins are
modelled in a coarse-grained fashion. We do comparative analysis of several
knotted globular proteins and the transiently knotted polyglutamine tracts of
length 60 alone and fused in exon 1 of the huntingtin protein. Huntingtin is
associated with Huntington disease, a well-known genetically-determined
neurodegenerative disease. We show that the presence of a knot hinders and
sometimes even jams translocation. We demonstrate that the probability to do so
depends on the protein, the model of the proteasome, the magnitude of the
pulling force, and the choice of the pulled terminus. In any case, the net
effect would be a hindrance in the proteasomal degradation process in the cell.
This would then yield toxicity \textit{via} two different mechanisms: one
through toxic monomers compromising degradation and another by the formation of
toxic oligomers. Our work paves the way to the mechanistic investigation of the
mechanical unfolding of knotted structures by the proteasome and its relation
to toxicity and disease.

  Consensus Connectome Dynamics of the Human Brain"	"  The increasing quantity and quality of the publicly available human cerebral
diffusion MRI data make possible the study of the brain as it was unimaginable
before. The Consensus Connectome Dynamics (CCD) is a remarkable phenomenon that
was discovered by continuously decreasing the minimum confidence-parameter at
the graphical interface of the Budapest Reference Connectome Server
(\url{http://connectome.pitgroup.org}). The Budapest Reference Connectome
Server depicts the cerebral connections of $n=418$ subjects with a
frequency-parameter $k$: For any $k=1,2,...,n$ one can view the graph of the
edges that are present in at least $k$ connectomes. If parameter $k$ is
decreased one-by-one from $k=n$ through $k=1$ then more and more edges appear
in the graph, since the inclusion condition is relaxed. The surprising
observation is that the appearance of the edges is far from random: it
resembles a growing, complex structure, like a tree or a shrub (visualized on
\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxlyudPaVUE}). Here we examine the
robustness of the CCD phenomenon, and we show that it is almost independent of
the particular choice of the set of underlying individual connectomes, yielding
the CCD phenomenon. This result shows that the CCD phenomenon is very likely a
biological property of the human brain and not just a property of the data sets
examined. We also present a simulation that well-describes the growth of the
CCD structure: in our random graph model a doubly-preferential attachment
distribution is found to mimic the CCD: a new edge appear with a probability
proportional to the sum of the degrees of the endpoints of the new edge.

cartilage its properties. The frictionless contact model constructed here
consists in two thin biphasic transversely isotropic transversely homogeneous
(TITH) cartilage layers firmly attached onto rigid substrates and shaped as
elliptic paraboloids of different radii. Using asymptotic techniques, a
solution to the deformation problem of such material has been recently obtained
extending previous ones referred to homogeneous materials. The layer itself is
thin in comparison with the size of the contact area and the observed time is
shorter than the hydrogel characteristic time. The emerging three-dimensional
contact problem is solved in closed-form and numerical benchmarks for constant
and oscillating loads are given. The results are shown in terms of contact
pressure and approach of the bones. The latter is derived to be directly
proportional to the contact area. Existing experimental data are reinterpreted
in view of the current model formulation. Comparisons are made with existing
solutions for homogeneous biphasic materials in order to underline the
functional importance of inhomogeneity in spreading the contact pressure
distribution across the contact area. Particular attention is paid to the
applicability of the retrieved formulas for interpreting measurements of in

in the lines of the survival curve but independent of the standard deviation
parameter. This is done by estimating the health state curve and calculating
the total area under the curve. An interesting comparison with the survival
curves is done. The health status measure (HSM or HS) resulting is of the form
of the life expectancy (LE) as it is expressed in terms of years of age. The HS
is independent of the standard deviation. When a perfect rectangularization of
the survival curve appear, the LE is equal to the age where the health state
curve approaches zero. The provided HS form gives rise to an interesting
classification of various countries. The results are close to those obtained by
the LE estimator with an interesting reorganization of country ranking. We also
provide illustrations of our estimated Health Status along with comparative
presentations of the Healthy Life Expectancy and the HALE measures in several
countries. Theoretical issues are provided and important stochastic simulations

  Visual Stream"	"  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have structures that are loosely
related to that of the primate visual cortex. Surprisingly, when these networks
are trained for object classification, the activity of their early,
intermediate, and later layers becomes closely related to activity patterns in
corresponding parts of the primate ventral visual stream. The activity
statistics are far from identical, but perhaps remaining differences can be
minimized in order to produce artificial networks with highly brain-like
activity and performance, which would provide a rich source of insight into
primate vision. One way to align CNN activity more closely with neural activity
is to add cost functions that directly drive deep layers to approximate neural
recordings. However, suitably large datasets are particularly difficult to
obtain for deep structures, such as the primate middle temporal area (MT). To
work around this barrier, we have developed a rich empirical model of activity
in MT. The model is pixel-computable, so it can provide an arbitrarily large
(but approximate) set of labels to better guide learning in the corresponding
layers of deep networks. Our model approximates a number of MT phenomena more
closely than previous models. Furthermore, our model approximates population
statistics in detail through fourteen parameter distributions that we estimated
from the electrophysiology literature. In general, deep networks with internal
representations that closely approximate those of the brain may help to clarify
the mechanisms that produce these representations, and the roles of various
properties of these representations in performance of vision tasks. Although
our empirical model inevitably differs from real neural activity, it allows
tuning properties to be modulated independently, which may allow very detailed
exploration of the origins and functional roles of these properties.

for the evolution of a single species population density, that includes
reproduction, competition for resources and spatial spreading, while subject to
an external harmful effect. The habitat is spatially heterogeneous, there
existing a refuge where the population can be protected. Temporal variability
is introduced by the intermittent character of the refuge. This scenario can
apply to a wide range of situations, from a lab setting where bacteria can be
protected by a blinking mask from ultraviolet radiation, to large scale
ecosystems, like a marine reserve where there can be seasonal fishing
prohibitions. Using analytical and numerical tools, we investigate the

Damuth's 'energetic equivalence rule' supported Van Valen's conjecture by
showing a trade off between few big animals per area with high individual
metabolic rates compared to abundant small species with low energy
requirements. We use established metabolic scaling theory to compare variation
in densities and individual energy use in human societies to other land
mammals. We show that hunter-gatherers occurred at lower densities than a
mammal of our size. Most modern humans, in contrast, concentrate in large
cities at densities that are up to four orders of magnitude greater than
hunter-gatherers yet cities consume up to two orders of magnitude greater
energy per capita. Today, cities across the globe flux greater energy than net
primary productivity on a per area basis. This is possible through enormous
fluxes of energy and materials across urban boundaries to sustain hyper-dense,
modern humans. The metabolic rift with nature created by hyper-dense cities
supported by fossil fuel energy poses formidable challenges for establishing a
sustainable relationship on a rapidly urbanizing, yet finite planet.

excellent agreement with experimental results. Fourier analyses as well as

Min-protein densities and the volume-to-surface ratio. In general, our work

1610.05348	q-bio	q-bio.MN	Markov State Models of Gene Regulatory Networks	"  Gene regulatory networks with dynamics characterized by multiple stable
states underlie cell fate-decisions. Quantitative models that can link
molecular-level knowledge of gene regulation to a global understanding of
network dynamics have the potential to guide cell-reprogramming strategies.
Networks are often modeled by the stochastic Chemical Master Equation, but
methods for systematic identification of key properties of the global dynamics
are currently lacking. We present a method for analyzing global dynamics of
gene networks using the Markov State Model (MSM) framework, which utilizes a
separation-of-timescales based clustering method to obtain a coarse-grained
state transition graph that approximates global gene network dynamics. The
method identifies the number, phenotypes, and lifetimes of long-lived network
states. Application of transition path theory to the constructed MSM decomposes
global dynamics into a set of dominant transition paths and associated relative
probabilities for stochastic state-switching. In this proof-of-concept study,
we found that the MSM provides a general framework for analyzing and
visualizing stochastic multistability and state-transitions in gene networks.
Our results suggest that the MSM framework, adopted from the field of atomistic
Molecular Dynamics, can be a useful tool for quantitative Systems Biology at
the network scale.

  Case of competitive inhibition"	"  Reliability of kinetic parameters are crucial in understanding enzyme
kinetics within cellular system. The present study suggests a few cautions that
need introspection for estimation of parameters like K(M), V(max) and K(I)
using Lineweaver-Burk plots. The quality of IC(50) too needs a thorough

1610.05512	q-bio	q-bio.QM	"Towards a HPC-oriented parallel implementation of a learning algorithm
  for bioinformatics applications"	"  Background: The huge quantity of data produced in Biomedical research needs
sophisticated algorithmic methodologies for its storage, analysis, and
processing. High Performance Computing (HPC) appears as a magic bullet in this
challenge. However, several hard to solve parallelization and load balancing
problems arise in this context. Here we discuss the HPC-oriented implementation
of a general purpose learning algorithm, originally conceived for DNA analysis
and recently extended to treat uncertainty on data (U BRAIN). The U-BRAIN
algorithm is a learning algorithm that finds a Boolean formula in disjunctive
normal form (DNF), of approximately minimum complexity, that is consistent with
a set of data (instances) which may have missing bits. The conjunctive terms of
the formula are computed in an iterative way by identifying, from the given
data, a family of sets of conditions that must be satisfied by all the positive
instances and violated by all the negative ones; such conditions allow the
computation of a set of coefficients (relevances) for each attribute (literal),
that form a probability distribution, allowing the selection of the term
literals. The great versatility that characterizes it, makes U-BRAIN applicable
in many of the fields in which there are data to be analyzed. However the
memory and the execution time required by the running are of O(n3) and of O(n5)
order, respectively, and so, the algorithm is unaffordable for huge data sets.

1610.05561	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Adaptive stimulus design for dynamic recurrent neural network models	"  We present a theoretical application of an optimal experiment design (OED)
methodology to the development of mathematical models to describe the
stimulus-response relationship of sensory neurons. Although there are a few
related studies in the computational neuroscience literature on this topic,
most of them are either involving non-linear static maps or simple linear
filters cascaded to a static non-linearity. Although the linear filters might
be appropriate to demonstrate some aspects of neural processes, the high level
of non-linearity in the nature of the stimulus-response data may render them
inadequate. In addition, modelling by a static non-linear input - output map
may mask important dynamical (time-dependent) features in the response data.
Due to all those facts a non-linear continuous time dynamic recurrent neural
network that models the excitatory and inhibitory membrane potential dynamics
is preferred. The main goal of this research is to estimate the parametric
details of this model from the available stimulus-response data. In order to
design an efficient estimator an optimal experiment design scheme is proposed
which computes a pre-shaped stimulus to maximize a certain measure of Fisher
Information Matrix. This measure depends on the estimated values of the
parameters in the current step and the optimal stimuli are used in a maximum
likelihood estimation procedure to find an estimate of the network parameters.
This process works as a loop until a reasonable convergence occurs. The
response data is discontinuous as it is composed of the neural spiking instants
which is assumed to obey the Poisson statistical distribution. Thus the
likelihood functions depend on the Poisson statistics. In order to validate the
approach and evaluate its performance, a comparison with another approach on
estimation based on randomly generated stimuli is also presented.

1610.05564	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Active inference, eye movements and oculomotor delays	"  This paper considers the problem of sensorimotor delays in the optimal
control of (smooth) eye movements under uncertainty. Specifically, we consider
delays in the visuo-oculomotor loop and their implications for active
inference. Active inference uses a generalisation of Kalman filtering to
provide Bayes optimal estimates of hidden states and action in generalized
coordinates of motion. Representing hidden states in generalized coordinates
provides a simple way of compensating for both sensory and oculomotor delays.
The efficacy of this scheme is illustrated using neuronal simulations of
pursuit initiation responses, with and without compensation. We then consider
an extension of the gener-ative model to simulate smooth pursuit eye movements
- in which the visuo-oculomotor system believes both the target and its centre
of gaze are attracted to a (hidden) point moving in the visual field. Finally,
the generative model is equipped with a hierarchical structure, so that it can
recognise and remember unseen (occluded) trajectories and emit anticipatory
responses. These simulations speak to a straightforward and neurobiologically
plausible solution to the generic problem of integrating information from
different sources with different temporal delays and the particular
difficulties encountered when a system - like the oculomotor system - tries to
control its environment with delayed signals.

1610.05654	q-bio	q-bio.NC cs.CL	The infochemical core	"  Vocalizations and less often gestures have been the object of linguistic
research over decades. However, the development of a general theory of
communication with human language as a particular case requires a clear
understanding of the organization of communication through other means.
Infochemicals are chemical compounds that carry information and are employed by
small organisms that cannot emit acoustic signals of optimal frequency to
achieve successful communication. Here the distribution of infochemicals across
species is investigated when they are ranked by their degree or the number of
species with which it is associated (because they produce or they are sensitive
to it). The quality of the fit of different functions to the dependency between
degree and rank is evaluated with a penalty for the number of parameters of the
function. Surprisingly, a double Zipf (a Zipf distribution with two regimes
with a different exponent each) is the model yielding the best fit although it
is the function with the largest number of parameters. This suggests that the
world wide repertoire of infochemicals contains a chemical nucleus shared by
many species and reminiscent of the core vocabularies found for human language
in dictionaries or large corpora.

1610.05715	q-bio	q-bio.BM q-bio.QM	"Tomographic docking suggests the mechanism of auxin receptor TIR1
  selectivity"	"  We study the binding of plant hormone IAA on its receptor TIR1 introducing a
novel computational method that we call tomographic docking and that accounts
for interactions occurring along the depth of the binding pocket. Our results
suggest that selectivity is related to constraints that potential ligands
encounter on their way from the surface of the protein to their final position
at the pocket bottom. Tomographic docking helps develop specific hypotheses
about ligand binding, distinguishing binders from non-binders, and suggests
that binding is a three-step mechanism, consisting of engagement with a niche
in the back wall of the pocket, interaction with a molecular filter which
allows or precludes further descent of ligands, and binding on the pocket base.
Only molecules that are able to descend the pocket and bind at its base allow
the co-receptor IAA7 to bind on the complex, thus behaving as active auxins.
Analyzing the interactions at different depths, our new method helps in
identifying critical residues that constitute preferred future study targets
and in the quest for safe and effective herbicides. Also, it has the potential
to extend the utility of docking from ligand searches to the study of processes
contributing to selectivity.

accelerated healing, although such design remains a challenge from material and
manufacturing standpoints. Aiming towards the clinical translation of knowledge
gained in vitro with highly swollen rat tail collagen hydrogels, this study
investigated the healing capability in a diabetic mouse wound model of
telopeptide-free, protease-inhibiting collagen networks. 4 vinylbenzylation and
UV irradiation of type I atelocollagen (AC) led to hydrogel networks with
chemical and macroscopic properties comparable to previous collagen analogues,
attributable to similar lysine content and dichroic properties. After 4 days in
vitro, hydrogels induced nearly 50 RFU% reduction in matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP)-9 activity, whilst showing less than 20 wt.-% weight loss. After 20 days
in vivo, dry networks promoted 99% closure of 10x10 mm full thickness wounds
and accelerated neodermal tissue formation compared to Mepilex. This collagen
system can be equipped with multiple, customisable properties and functions key
to personalised chronic wound care.

1610.05817	q-bio	q-bio.PE stat.CO	phylodyn: an R package for phylodynamic simulation and inference	"  We introduce phylodyn, an R package for phylodynamic analysis based on gene
genealogies. The package main functionality is Bayesian nonparametric
estimation of effective population size fluctuations over time. Our
implementation includes several Markov chain Monte Carlo-based methods and an
integrated nested Laplace approximation-based approach for phylodynamic
inference that have been developed in recent years. Genealogical data describe
the timed ancestral relationships of individuals sampled from a population of
interest. Here, individuals are assumed to be sampled at the same point in time
(isochronous sampling) or at different points in time (heterochronous
sampling); in addition, sampling events can be modeled with preferential
sampling, which means that the intensity of sampling events is allowed to
depend on the effective population size trajectory. We assume the coalescent
and the sequentially Markov coalescent processes as generative models of
genealogies. We include several coalescent simulation functions that are useful
for testing our phylodynamics methods via simulation studies. We compare the
performance and outputs of various methods implemented in phylodyn and outline
their strengths and weaknesses. R package phylodyn is available at

1610.05872	q-bio	q-bio.NC stat.ML	Making brain-machine interfaces robust to future neural variability	"  A major hurdle to clinical translation of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) is
that current decoders, which are trained from a small quantity of recent data,
become ineffective when neural recording conditions subsequently change. We
tested whether a decoder could be made more robust to future neural variability
by training it to handle a variety of recording conditions sampled from months
of previously collected data as well as synthetic training data perturbations.
We developed a new multiplicative recurrent neural network BMI decoder that
successfully learned a large variety of neural-to- kinematic mappings and
became more robust with larger training datasets. When tested with a non-human
primate preclinical BMI model, this decoder was robust under conditions that
disabled a state-of-the-art Kalman filter based decoder. These results validate
a new BMI strategy in which accumulated data history is effectively harnessed,
and may facilitate reliable daily BMI use by reducing decoder retraining
downtime.

technique known as Carleman linearization that turns (for a certain class of
functions) this problem into simply taking the power of a real number. We
expand this method, showing in particular that it can be used for population
models with immigration, and we also apply it to the famous logistic map. We
also are able to give a number of results for the invariant density of this
map, some being related to the Carleman linearization.

  Germination Stage"	"  Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the seed
germination response of six Acacia species under different NaCl concentrations
in order to explore opportunities for selection and breeding salt tolerant
genotypes. Methodology: Germination of seeds was evaluated under salt stresses
using 5 treatment levels: 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mM of NaCl. Corrected
germination rate (GC), germination rate index (GRI) and mean germination time
(MGT) were recorded during 10 days. Results: The results indicated that
germination was significantly reduced in all species with the increase in NaCl
concentrations. However, significant interspecific variation for salt tolerance
was observed. The greatest variability in tolerance was observed at moderate
salt stress (200 mM of NaCl) and the decrease in germination appeared to be
more accentuated in A. cyanophylla and A. cyclops. Although, A. raddiana,
remains the most interesting, it preserved the highest percentage (GC = 80%)
and velocity of germination in all species studied in this study, even in the
high salt levels. This species exhibited a particular adaptability to salt
environment, at least at this stage in the life cycle and could be recommended
for plantation establishment in salt affected areas. On the other hand, when
ungerminated seeds were transferred from NaCl treatments to distilled water,
they recovered largely their germination without a lag period and with high
speed. This indicated that the germination inhibition was related to a
reversible osmotic stress that induced dormancy rather than specific ion
toxicity. Conclusion: This ability to germinate after exposure to higher
concentrations of NaCl suggests that studied species, especially the most
tolerant could be able to germinate under the salt affected soils and could be
utilized for the rehabilitation of damaged arid zones.

  disease"	"  The two primary causal dimensions of age-related disease are rate and
function. Change in rate of disease development shifts the age of onset. Change
in physiological function provides necessary steps in disease progression. A
causal factor may alter the rate of physiological change, but that causal
factor itself may have no direct physiological role. Alternatively, a causal
factor may provide a necessary physiological function, but that causal factor
itself may not alter the rate of disease onset. The rate-function duality
provides the basis for solving puzzles of age-related disease. Causal factors
of cancer illustrate the duality between rate processes of discovery, such as
somatic mutation, and necessary physiological functions, such as invasive
penetration across tissue barriers. Examples from cancer suggest general
principles of age-related disease.

  widespread decay"	"  The motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) typically begins
with localized muscle weakness. Progressive, widespread paralysis often follows
over a few years. Does the disease begin with local changes in a small piece of
neural tissue and then spread? Or does neural decay happen independently across
diverse spatial locations? The distinction matters, because local initiation
may arise by local changes in a tissue microenvironment, by somatic mutation,
or by various epigenetic or regulatory fluctuations in a few cells. A local
trigger must be coupled with a mechanism for spread. By contrast, independent
decay across spatial locations cannot begin by a local change, but must depend
on some global predisposition or spatially distributed change that leads to
approximately synchronous decay. This article outlines the conceptual frame by
which one contrasts local triggers and spread versus parallel spatially
distributed decay. Various neurodegenerative diseases differ in their
mechanistic details, but all can usefully be understood as falling along a
continuum of interacting local and global processes. Cancer provides an example
of disease progression by local triggers and spatial spread, setting a
conceptual basis for clarifying puzzles in neurodegeneration. Heart disease
also has crucial interactions between global processes, such as circulating
lipid levels, and local processes in the development of atherosclerotic
plaques. The distinction between local and global processes helps to understand
these various age-related diseases.

1610.06311	q-bio	q-bio.SC physics.bio-ph q-bio.BM	"Theory on the mechanisms of combinatorial binding of transcription
  factors with DNA"	"  We develop a theoretical framework on the mechanism of combinatorial binding
of transcription factors (TFs) with their specific binding sites on DNA. We
consider three possible mechanisms viz. monomer, hetero-oligomer and
coordinated recruitment pathways. In the monomer pathway, combinatorial TFs
search for their targets in an independent manner and the protein-protein
interactions among them will be insignificant. The protein-protein interactions
are very strong so that the hetero-oligomer complex of TFs as a whole searches
for the cognate sites in case of hetero-oligomer pathway. The TF which arrived
first will recruit the adjacent TFs in a sequential manner in the recruitment
pathway. The free energy released from the protein-protein interactions among
TFs will be in turn utilized to stabilize the TFs-DNA complex. Such coordinated
binding of TFs in fact emerges as the cooperative effect. Monomer and
hetero-oligomer pathways are efficient only when few TFs are involved in the
combinatorial regulation. Detailed random walk simulations suggest that when
the number of TFs in a combination increases then the searching efficiency of
TFs in these pathways decreases with the increasing number of TFs in a power
law manner. The power law exponent associated with the monomer pathway seems to
be strongly dependent on the number of TFs, distance between the initial
position of TFs from their specific binding sites and the hop size associated
with the dynamics of TFs on DNA.

taking a limit, which inhibits use in similar applications as the SWM formula.
However, using our expression to find an analytical result on the spectral
radius of a special product of two matrices leads to an application. In
particular, we find a way to compute the fundamental reproductive ratio of a
relapsing disease being spread by a vector among two species of host that

male Japanese quail were divided into two groups; control fed and starved. The
control-fed group was offered food and water ad libitum and the starved group
was subjected to a short-period of food deprivation. After 2.5 days, the serum
was obtained and different parameters including the total protein, AST, ALT,
triglyceride, HDL, LDL, creatinine and urea were assessed. Gastrointestinal
tract, stomach and liver were excised and their masses were estimated. Paraffin
and resin embedded sections from the proventriculus, gizzard, liver, duodenum,
kidney and pancreas were examined with a light microscopy. Results Significant
decreases in the masses of body, gastrointestinal tract, stomach and liver of
the starved group were recorded. The liver and duodenum were the most affected
organs. The liver showed depletion of glycogen, vacuolation, hyperemia and
cellular infiltrations. Duodenal villi showed degenerative changes in lamina
epithelialis and cellular infiltrations in the lamina propria. Biochemical
analysis revealed a decreased level of total protein, AST and ALT, increased
cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL, and unchanged HDL, urea and creatinine by
starvation. Conclusion The current study described in details the effect of
short time starvation on quail organs. Time-point adaptive responses of male
quail to starvation and refeeding on quail organs will be investigated in

understanding of DS's prevalence in general population. The results showed the
prevalence of DS is very gender specific and age specific. Both women and men
have few DS before 50 years old, after 50 years old both women and men start to
develop DS, with women having a faster developing rate than men. For elderly
Chinese (>=65 yrs, mean age: 72.5 yrs), large population based studies
(MsOS(Hong Kong) and MrOS (Hong Kong), females n=2000 and males n=2000) showed
DS prevalence was for 25.0% for women and 19.1% for men, and the prevalence F:M
(women:men) ratio was 1.3:1. The published data (MsOS(USA) and MrOS(USA)
studies) seem to show elderly Caucasian American has a higher DS prevalence,
being approximately 60-70% higher than elderly Chinese; however the prevalence
F:M ratio was similar to elderly Chinese population. Patient data showed female
patients more often received treatment than men; and preliminary data show the
ratio of numbers of female patients received treatment compared with men did
not differ between Northeast Asians (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) and
European and American Caucasians, being around 2:1 in elderly population. The
existing data also suggest that menopause may be a contributing factor for the

  cyanobacterial diurnal growth"	"  Cyanobacteria are an integral part of the Earth's biogeochemical cycles and a
promising resource for the synthesis of renewable bioproducts from atmospheric
CO2 . Growth and metabolism of cyanobacteria are inherently tied to the diurnal
rhythm of light availability. As yet, however, insight into the stoichiometric
and energetic constraints of cyanobacterial diurnal growth is limited. Here, we
develop a computational platform to evaluate the optimality of diurnal
phototrophic growth using a high-quality genome-scale metabolic reconstruction
of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. We formulate
phototrophic growth as a self-consistent autocatalytic process and evaluate the
resulting time-dependent resource allocation problem using constraint-based
analysis. Based on a narrow and well defined set of parameters, our approach
results in an ab initio prediction of growth properties over a full diurnal
cycle. In particular, our approach allows us to study the optimality of
metabolite partitioning during diurnal growth. The cyclic pattern of glycogen
accumulation, an emergent property of the model, has timing characteristics
that are shown to be a trade-off between conflicting cellular objectives. The
approach presented here provides insight into the time-dependent resource
allocation problem of phototrophic diurnal growth and may serve as a general
framework to evaluate the optimality of metabolic strategies that evolved in
photosynthetic organisms under diurnal conditions.

bio-fuels. For biologists, a key challenge is that many reactions are
impractical or expensive to be found through experiments. Our task is to
recover the missing reactions. By exploiting the problem structure, we model
reaction recovery as a hyperlink prediction problem, where each reaction is
regarded as a hyperlink connecting its participating vertices (metabolites).
Different from the traditional link prediction problem where two nodes form a
link, a hyperlink can involve an arbitrary number of nodes. Since the
cardinality of a hyperlink is variable, existing classifiers based on a fixed
number of input features become infeasible. Traditional methods, such as common
neighbors and Katz index, are not applicable either, since they are restricted
to pairwise similarities. In this paper, we propose a novel hyperlink
prediction algorithm, called Matrix Boosting (MATBoost). MATBoost conducts
inference jointly in the incidence space and adjacency space by performing an
iterative completion-matching optimization. We carry out extensive experiments
to show that MATBoost achieves state-of-the-art performance. For a metabolic
network with 1805 metabolites and 2583 reactions, our algorithm can
successfully recover nearly 200 reactions out of 400 missing reactions.

  population than in middle aged population: a retrospective analysis of 8,144
  cases in Mainland China"	"  Purpose: Rupture of an intracranial aneurysm is the most common cause of
subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), which is a life-threatening acute
cerebrovascular event that typically affects working-age people. This study
aims to investigate the aneurysmal SAH incidence rate in elderly population
than in middle aged population in China. Materials and methods: Aneurysmal SAH
cases were collected retrospectively from the archives of 21 hospitals in
Mainland China. All the cases collected were from September 2016 and backward
consecutively for a period of time up to 8 years. SAH was initially diagnosed
by brain computed tomography, and CT angiography (CTA) or digital subtraction
angiography (DSA) was followed and SAH was confirmed to be due to cerebral
aneurysm. When for cases multiple bleeding occurred, the age of the first SAH
was used in this study. The toltal incidence from all hospital at each age were
summed together for females and males; then adjusted by the total population
number at each age for females and males. The total population data was from
the 2010 population census of the People's Republic of China. Results: In total
there were 8,144 cases, with 4,861 females and 3,283 males. Our analysis shows
for both females and males the relative aneurysmal SAH rate started to decrease
after around 65 years old. The males the relative aneurysmal SAH rate might
have started to decrease after around 55 years old. Conclusion: In contrast to
previous reports, our data demonstrated a decreased aneurysmal subarachnoid
hemorrhage incidence rate in elderly population than in middle aged population.
Our data therefore support the hypothesis that aneurysms do not grow
progressively once they form but probably either rupture or stabilize and that
very elderly patients are at a reduced risk of rupture compared with atients
who are younger with the same-sized aneurysms.

  mixtures in British Columbia"	"  Mixed-species growth models are needed as a synthesis of ecological knowledge
and for guiding forest management. Individual-tree models have been commonly
used, but the difficulties of reliably scaling from the individual to the stand
level are often underestimated. Emergent properties and statistical issues
limit their effectiveness. A more holistic modelling of aggregates at the whole
stand level is a potentially attractive alternative. This work explores
methodology for developing biologically consistent dynamic mixture models where
the state is described by aggregate stand-level variables for species or
age/size cohorts. The methods are demonstrated and tested with a two-cohort
model for spruce-aspen mixtures named SAM. The models combine single-species
submodels and submodels for resource partitioning among the cohorts. The
partitioning allows for differences in competitive strength among species and
size classes, and for complementarity effects. Height growth reduction in
suppressed cohorts is also modelled. SAM fits well the available data, and
exhibits behaviors consistent with current ecological knowledge. The general
framework can be applied to any number of cohorts, and should be useful as a
basis for modelling other mixed-species or uneven-aged stands.

  to stratification correction in genome-wide association studies"	"  Genetic variation in human populations is influenced by geographic ancestry
due to spatial locality in historical mating and migration patterns. Spatial
population structure in genetic datasets has been traditionally analyzed using
either model-free algorithms, such as principal components analysis (PCA) and
multidimensional scaling, or using explicit spatial probabilistic models of
allele frequency evolution. We develop a general probabilistic model and an
associated inference algorithm that unify the model-based and data-driven
approaches to visualizing and inferring population structure. Our algorithm,
Geographic Ancestry Positioning (GAP), relates local genetic distances between
samples to their spatial distances, and can be used for visually discerning
population structure as well as accurately inferring the spatial origin of
individuals on a two-dimensional continuum. On both simulated and several real
datasets from diverse human populations, GAP exhibits substantially lower error
in reconstructing spatial ancestry coordinates compared to PCA.
  Our spatial inference algorithm can also be effectively applied to the
problem of population stratification in genome-wide association studies (GWAS),
where hidden population structure can create fictitious associations when
population ancestry is correlated with both the genotype and the trait. We
develop an association test that uses the ancestry coordinates inferred by GAP
to accurately account for ancestry-induced correlations in GWAS. Based on
simulations and analysis of a dataset of 10 metabolic traits measured in a
Northern Finland cohort, which is known to exhibit significant population
structure, we find that our method has superior power to current approaches.

  compatible: The cydex blue assay"	"  Determination of protein concentration in often an absolute pre-requisite in
preparing samples for biochemical and proteomic analyses. However, current
protein assay methods are not compatible with both reducers and detergents,
which are however present simultaneously in most denaturing extraction buffers
used in proteomics and electrophoresis, and in particular in SDS
electrophoresis. We found that inclusion of cyclodextrins in a Coomassie
blue-based assay made it compatible with detergents, as cyclodextrins complex
detergents in a 1:1 molecular ratio. As this type of assay is intrinsically
resistant to reducers, we have thus developed a single step assay that is both
detergent and reducer compatible. Depending on the type and concentration of
detergents present in the sample buffer, either beta-cyclodextrin or
alpha-cyclodextrin can be used, the former being able to complex a wider range
of detergents and the latter being able to complex higher amounts of detergents
due to its greater solubility in water. Cyclodextrins are used at final
concentrations of 2-10 mg/mL in the assay mix. This typically allows to measure
samples containing as little as 0.1 mg/mL protein, in the presence of up to 2%
detergent and reducers such as 5 % mercaptoethanol or 50 mM DTT in a single
step with a simple spectrophotometric assay. This article is protected by

1610.07406	q-bio	q-bio.PE physics.soc-ph	Combination with anti-tit-for-tat remedies problems of tit-for-tat	"  One of the most important questions in game theory concerns how mutual
cooperation can be achieved and maintained in a social dilemma. In Axelrod's
tournaments of the iterated prisoner's dilemma, Tit-for-Tat (TFT) demonstrated
the role of reciprocity in the emergence of cooperation. However, the stability
of TFT does not hold in the presence of implementation error, and a TFT
population is prone to neutral drift to unconditional cooperation, which
eventually invites defectors. We argue that a combination of TFT and anti-TFT
(ATFT) overcomes these difficulties in a noisy environment, provided that ATFT
is defined as choosing the opposite to the opponent's last move. According to
this TFT-ATFT strategy, a player normally uses TFT; turns to ATFT upon
recognizing his or her own error; returns to TFT either when mutual cooperation
is recovered or when the opponent unilaterally defects twice in a row. The
proposed strategy provides simple and deterministic behavioral rules for
correcting implementation error in a way that cannot be exploited by the
opponent, and suppresses the neutral drift to unconditional cooperation.

1610.07549	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Enumeration of ancestral configurations for matching gene trees and
  species trees"	"  Given a gene tree and a species tree, ancestral configurations represent the
combinatorially distinct sets of gene lineages that can reach a given node of
the species tree. They have been introduced as a data structure for use in the
recursive computation of the conditional probability under the multispecies
coalescent model of a gene tree topology given a species tree, the cost of this
computation being affected by the number of ancestral configurations of the
gene tree in the species tree. For matching gene trees and species trees, we
obtain enumerative results on ancestral configurations. We study ancestral
configurations in balanced and unbalanced families of trees determined by a
given seed tree, showing that for seed trees with more than one taxon, the
number of ancestral configurations increases for both families exponentially in
the number of taxa $n$. For fixed $n$, the maximal number of ancestral
configurations tabulated at the species tree root node and the largest number
of labeled histories possible for a labeled topology occur for trees with
precisely the same unlabeled shape. For ancestral configurations at the root,
the maximum increases with $k_0^n$, where $k_0 \approx 1.5028$ is a quadratic
recurrence constant. Under a uniform distribution over the set of labeled trees
of given size, the mean number of root ancestral configurations grows with
$\sqrt{3/2}(4/3)^n$ and the variance with approximately $1.4048(1.8215)^n$. The
results provide a contribution to the combinatorial study of gene trees and
species trees.

  perceived through press perturbations"	"  We consider the goal of predicting how complex networks respond to chronic
(press) perturbations when characterizations of their network topology and
interaction strengths are associated with uncertainty. Our primary result is
the derivation of exact formulas for the expected number and probability of
qualitatively incorrect predictions about a system's responses under
uncertainties drawn form arbitrary distributions of error. These formulas
obviate the current use of simulations, algorithms, and qualitative modeling
techniques. Additional indices provide new tools for identifying which links in
a network are most qualitatively and quantitatively sensitive to error, and for
determining the volume of errors within which predictions will remain
qualitatively determinate (i.e. sign insensitive). Together with recent
advances in the empirical characterization of uncertainty in ecological
networks, these tools bridge a way towards probabilistic predictions of network
dynamics.

  single shot fast spin echo acquisition: a validation study in healthy
  volunteers"	"  Purpose: To explore the usability and normal T1rho value of liver parenchyma
with a novel single breathhold black blood single shot fast spin echo
acquisition based liver imaging sequence. Materials and Methods: In total 19
health subjects (10 males, 9 females; mean age: 37.4 yrs; range: 23-54 yrs)
participated in the study. 11 subjects had liver scanned twice in the same
session to access scan-rescan repeatability. 12 subjects had liver scanned
twice in two sessions with 7-10 days' interval to access scan-rescan
reproducibility. MR was performed with a 3.0 T scanner with dual transmitter.
The MR sequence allows simultaneous acquisition of 4 spin lock times (TSLs:
0ms, 10 ms, 30 ms, 50ms) in 10 second. Inherent black blood effect of fast spin
echo and double inversion recovery were utilized to achieve blood signal
suppression. Results: The technique demonstrated good image quality and minimal
artifacts. For liver parenchyma, Bland-Altman plot showed the scan-rescan
repeatability mean difference was 0.025 ms (95% limits of agreement: -1.163 to
1.213 ms), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.977. The
scan-rescan reproducibility mean difference was -0.075 ms (95% limits of
agreement: -3.280 to 3.310 ms), and ICC was 0.820 which is better than the ICC
of 0.764 of a previous bright blood multi-breath hold gradient echo acquisition
technique. The liver T1rho value was 39.9 +/- 2.4 ms (range: 36.1 - 44.2 ms),
which is lower than the value of 42.8=/-2.1 ms acquired with the previous
bright blood technique. Conclusion: This study validated the application of a
single breathhold black blood single shot fast spin echo acquisition based for
human liver T1rho imaging. The lower liver parenchyma T1rho value and higher
scan rescan reproducibility may improve of the sensitivity of this technique.

magnetic resonance T1rho relaxation at 1.5 T. Methods: 20 males (age:
40.7+/-15.5 years, range: 22-68 years) and 22 females (age: 38.5 +/-14.8 years,
range: 21-62 years), were scanned at 1.5 Tesla using 3D fluid suppressed turbo
spin echo sequence. Regions-of-interests (ROIs) were obtained by atlas-based
tissue segmentation and T1rho was calculated by fitting the mean value to
monoexponential model. Correlation between T1rho relaxation of brain gray
matter regions and age was investigated. Results: A regional difference among
individual gray matter areas was noted; with hippocampus (98.37+/-5.37 msec)
and amygdala (94.95+/-4.34 msec) have the highest measurement, while pallidum
(83.81+/-5.49) and putamen (83.93+4.76) the lowest measurement. T1rho values
decreased slowly (mean slope: -0.256) and significantly (p<0.05) with age in
gray matter for subjects younger than 40 years old, while for subjects older
than 40 years old there was no significant correlation between T1rho relaxation
and age. Conclusion: T1rho relaxation demonstrates a bi-phase change with age
in adults of 22-68 years.

1610.07784	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio.QM	Robustness of flight leadership relations in pigeons	"  Collective animal movements produce spectacular natural phenomena that arise
from simple local interactions among group members. Flocks of homing pigeons,
Columba livia, provide a useful model for the study of collective motion and
decision making. During homing flights, flock members are forced to resolve
potentially divergent navigational preferences in order to stay together and
benefit from flying in a group. Recent work has demonstrated that some
individuals consistently contribute more to the movement decisions of the flock
than others do, thereby generating stable hierarchical leader/follower
networks. Yet, what attributes of a flying pigeon reliably predict leadership
remains an open question. We examined the flexibility of an individual's
hierarchical leadership rank (i.e. its ordinal position when flock members are
ranked according to the average time differences with which they lead or follow
others) as a function of changes in its navigational knowledge. We manipulated
already established hierarchical networks in three different flocks, by
providing certain individuals with additional homing experience. We found that
such training did not consistently lead to an increase in birds' leadership
ranks, and that, in general, the nature of leader/follower interactions between
trained and untrained birds remained unaffected. Thus, leadership hierarchies
in pigeon flocks appear resistant to changes in the navigational knowledge of a
subset of their members, at least when these changes are relatively small. We
discuss the implications of our results in light of the potential benefits of
structural stability in decision-making networks.

1610.08148	q-bio	q-bio.PE math.ST stat.TH	"Online Bayesian phylogenetic inference: theoretical foundations via
  Sequential Monte Carlo"	"  Phylogenetics, the inference of evolutionary trees from molecular sequence
data such as DNA, is an enterprise that yields valuable evolutionary
understanding of many biological systems. Bayesian phylogenetic algorithms,
which approximate a posterior distribution on trees, have become a popular if
computationally expensive means of doing phylogenetics. Modern data collection
technologies are quickly adding new sequences to already substantial databases.
With all current techniques for Bayesian phylogenetics, computation must start
anew each time a sequence becomes available, making it costly to maintain an
up-to-date estimate of a phylogenetic posterior. These considerations highlight
the need for an \emph{online} Bayesian phylogenetic method which can update an
existing posterior with new sequences.
  Here we provide theoretical results on the consistency and stability of
methods for online Bayesian phylogenetic inference based on Sequential Monte
Carlo (SMC) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We first show a consistency
result, demonstrating that the method samples from the correct distribution in
the limit of a large number of particles. Next we derive the first reported set
of bounds on how phylogenetic likelihood surfaces change when new sequences are
added. These bounds enable us to characterize the theoretical performance of
sampling algorithms by bounding the effective sample size (ESS) with a given
number of particles from below. We show that the ESS is guaranteed to grow
linearly as the number of particles in an SMC sampler grows. Surprisingly, this
result holds even though the dimensions of the phylogenetic model grow with
each new added sequence.

1610.08171	q-bio	cs.LO q-bio.QM	MELA: Modelling in Ecology with Location Attributes	"  Ecology studies the interactions between individuals, species and the
environment. The ability to predict the dynamics of ecological systems would
support the design and monitoring of control strategies and would help to
address pressing global environmental issues. It is also important to plan for
efficient use of natural resources and maintenance of critical ecosystem
services. The mathematical modelling of ecological systems often includes
nontrivial specifications of processes that influence the birth, death,
development and movement of individuals in the environment, that take into
account both biotic and abiotic interactions. To assist in the specification of
such models, we introduce MELA, a process algebra for Modelling in Ecology with
Location Attributes. Process algebras allow the modeller to describe concurrent
systems in a high-level language. A key feature of concurrent systems is that
they are composed of agents that can progress simultaneously but also interact
- a good match to ecological systems. MELA aims to provide ecologists with a
straightforward yet flexible tool for modelling ecological systems, with
particular emphasis on the description of space and the environment. Here we
present four example MELA models, illustrating the different spatial
arrangements which can be accommodated and demonstrating the use of MELA in
epidemiological and predator-prey scenarios.

applied to a set of 100 DNA sequences from the mitochondrially encoded NADH

phylogenetic tree computed using a maximum likelihood approach. This comparison
shows in particular that the clustering produced by the methodology combining
Laplacian Eigenmaps with Gaussian Mixture models is coherent with the phylogeny
as well as with the NCBI taxonomy. We also developed a Python package for this
procedure which is available online.

1610.08465	q-bio	stat.ML q-bio.NC	Bayesian latent structure discovery from multi-neuron recordings	"  Neural circuits contain heterogeneous groups of neurons that differ in type,
location, connectivity, and basic response properties. However, traditional
methods for dimensionality reduction and clustering are ill-suited to
recovering the structure underlying the organization of neural circuits. In
particular, they do not take advantage of the rich temporal dependencies in
multi-neuron recordings and fail to account for the noise in neural spike
trains. Here we describe new tools for inferring latent structure from
simultaneously recorded spike train data using a hierarchical extension of a
multi-neuron point process model commonly known as the generalized linear model
(GLM). Our approach combines the GLM with flexible graph-theoretic priors
governing the relationship between latent features and neural connectivity
patterns. Fully Bayesian inference via P\'olya-gamma augmentation of the
resulting model allows us to classify neurons and infer latent dimensions of
circuit organization from correlated spike trains. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method with applications to synthetic data and
multi-neuron recordings in primate retina, revealing latent patterns of neural
types and locations from spike trains alone.

bacterium able to grow on a diversity of carbon sources like sugars and organic
acids. It is a biotechnological relevant organism because of its highly
efficient ability to biosynthesize amino acids, such as L-glutamic acid and
L-lysine. Here, we reconstructed the most complete C. glutamicum regulatory
network to date and comprehensively analyzed its global organizational
properties, systems-level features and functional architecture. Our analyses
show the tremendous power of Abasy Atlas to study the functional organization
of regulatory networks. We created two models of the C. glutamicum regulatory
network: all-evidences (containing both weak and strong supported interactions,
genomic coverage = 73%) and strongly-supported (only accounting for strongly
supported evidences, genomic coverage = 71%). Using state-of-the-art
methodologies, we prove that power-law behaviors truly govern the connectivity
and clustering coefficient distributions. We found a non-previously reported
circuit motif that we named complex feed-forward motif. We highlighted the
importance of feedback loops for the functional architecture, beyond whether
they are statistically over-represented or not in the network. We show that the
previously reported top-down approach is inadequate to infer the hierarchy
governing a regulatory network because feedback bridges different hierarchical
layers, and the top-down approach disregards the presence of intermodular genes
shaping the integration layer. Our findings all together further support a
diamond-shaped, three-layered hierarchy exhibiting some feedback between
processing and coordination layers, which is shaped by four classes of
systems-level elements: global regulators, locally autonomous modules, basal
machinery and intermodular genes.

  predicts negative symptoms and Schizophrenia diagnosis 6 months later"	"  Background: The precise quantification of negative symptoms is necessary to
improve differential diagnosis and prognosis prediction in Schizophrenia. In
chronic psychotic patients, the representation of verbal reports as word graphs
provides automated sorting of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and control
groups based on the degree of speech connectedness. Here we aim to use machine
learning to verify whether speech connectedness during first clinical contact
can predict negative symptoms and Schizophrenia diagnosis six months later.
Methods: PANSS scores and memory reports were collected from 21 patients
undergoing first clinical contact for recent-onset psychosis and followed for 6
months to establish DSM-IV diagnosis, and 21 healthy controls. Each report was
represented as a graph in which words corresponded to nodes, and node temporal
succession corresponded to edges. Three connectedness attributes were extracted
from each graph, z-scores to random graph distributions were measured,
correlated with the PANSS negative subscale, combined into a single
Fragmentation Index, and used for predictions. Findings: Random-like speech was
prevalent among Schizophrenia patients (64% x 5% in Control group, p=0.0002).
Connectedness explained 92% of the PANSS negative subscale variance (p=0.0001).
The Fragmentation Index classified low versus high scores of PANSS negative
subscale with 93% accuracy (AUC=1), predicted Schizophrenia diagnosis with 89%
accuracy (AUC=0.89), and was validated in an independent cohort of chronic
psychotic patients. Interpretation: The structural randomness of speech graph
connectedness is increased in Schizophrenia. It provides a quantitative
measurement of word salad as a Fragmentation Index that tightly correlates with
negative symptoms and predicts Schizophrenia diagnosis during first clinical
contact of recent-onset psychosis.

artificial flapping wing fliers is highly complex, unsteady and generally
turbulent. Considering flapping flight in an unsteady wind environment with a
periodically varying lateral velocity component, we show that body rotations
experienced by flapping wing fliers result in the reorientation of the
aerodynamic force vector that can render a substantial cumulative deficit in
the vertical force. We derive quantitative estimates of the body roll amplitude
and the related energetic requirements to maintain the weight support in free
flight under such conditions. We conduct force measurements of a miniature
hummingbird-inspired robotic flapper and numerical simulations of a bumblebee.
In both cases, we demonstrate the loss of weight support due to body roll
rotations. Using semi-restrained flight measurements, we demonstrate the
increased power requirements to maintain altitude in unsteady winds, achieved
by increasing the flapping frequency. Flapping fliers may increase their
flapping frequency as well as the stroke amplitude to produce the required
increase in aerodynamic force, both of these two types of compensatory control
requiring additional energetic cost. We analyze the existing data from
experiments on animals flying in von K\'arm\'an streets and find reasonable
agreement with the proposed theoretical model.

  Embryonic Lung Branching Morphogenesis"	"  Organogenesis has been studied for decades, but fundamental questions
regarding the control of growth and shape remain unsolved. We have recently
shown that of all proposed mathematical models only ligand-receptor based
Turing models successfully reproduce the experimentally determined growth
fields of the embryonic lung and thus provide a mechanism for growth control
during embryonic lung development. Turing models are based on at least two
coupled non-linear reaction-diffusion equations. In case of the lung model, at
least two distinct layers (mesenchyme and epithelium) need to be considered
that express different components (ligand and receptor, respectively). The
Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method has previously been used to solve
this Turing system on growing and deforming (branching) domains, where
outgrowth occurs proportional to the strength of ligand-receptor signalling.
However, the ALE method requires mesh deformations that eventually limit its
use. Therefore, we incorporate the phase field method to simulate 3D embryonic
lung branching with COMSOL.

  regularization in spike-triggered adapting neurons"	"  Spike generation in neurons produces a temporal point process, whose
statistics is governed by intrinsic phenomena and the external incoming inputs
to be coded. In particular, spike-evoked adaptation currents support a slow
temporal process that conditions spiking probability at the present time
according to past activity. In this work, we study the statistics of interspike
interval correlations arising in such non-renewal spike trains, for a neuron
model that reproduces different spike modes in a small adaptation scenario. We
found that correlations are stronger as the neuron fires at a particular firing
rate, which is defined by the adaptation process. When set in a subthreshold
regime, the neuron may sustain this particular firing rate, and thus induce
correlations, by noise. Given that, in this regime, interspike intervals are
negatively correlated at any lag, this effect surprisingly implies a reduction
in the variability of the spike count statistics at a finite noise intensity.

wide range of tests for diagnostic purposes. Prominent among them are tests
using miRNA expression levels. Genomics and proteomics now provide expression
levels of hundreds of miRNAs at a time. However, for actual diagnostic tools to
become reality requires the simultaneous development of methods to interpret
the large amounts of miRNA expression data that can be generated from a single
patient sample. Because these data are in numeric form, quantitative methods
must be developed. Statistics such as p-values and log fold change give some
insight, but the diagnostic effectiveness of each miRNA test must first be
evaluated. Here, the author has developed a traditional, sensitivity- and
specificity-based algorithm, as well as a modern machine learning algorithm,
and evaluated their diagnostic potential for lung cancer against a publicly
available database. The findings suggest that the machine learning algorithm
achieves higher accuracy (97% for cancerous and 73% for normal samples), in
addition to providing confidence intervals that could provide valuable
diagnostic support. The machine learning algorithm also has significant
potential for expansion to more complex diagnoses of lung cancer sub-types, to
other cancers as well diseases beyond cancer. Both algorithms are available on

selectively enhances the neural signal in the visual cortex for task-relevant
stimuli, but this has been tested only under conditions of minimal competition
of visual attention. Here we show during high competition, that is, two stimuli
in a shared receptive field possessing opposing modulatory goals, top-down
attention suppresses both task-relevant and irrelevant neural signals within
100 ms of stimuli onset. This non-selective engagement of top-down attentional
resources serves to reduce the feedforward signal representing irrelevant
stimuli.

domains, we use a stochastic lattice model to study protein reaction and
diffusion processes in crowded membranes. We find that the stochastic
reaction-diffusion dynamics of synaptic proteins provide a simple physical
mechanism for collective fluctuations in synaptic domains, the molecular
turnover observed at synaptic domains, key features of the single-molecule
trajectories observed for synaptic proteins, and spatially inhomogeneous
protein lifetimes at the cell membrane. Our results suggest that central
aspects of the single-molecule and collective dynamics observed for membrane
protein domains can be understood in terms of stochastic reaction-diffusion
processes at the cell membrane.

learning, in particular the ability to learn complex concepts without guidance,
in a specific order. A notable example is the category of 'containers' and the
notion of containment, one of the earliest spatial relations to be learned,
starting already at 2.5 months, and preceding other common relations (e.g.,
support). Such spontaneous unsupervised learning stands in contrast with
current highly successful computational models, which learn in a supervised
manner, that is, by using large data sets of labeled examples. How can
meaningful concepts be learned without guidance, and what determines the
trajectory of infant learning, making some notions appear consistently earlier
than others?

  G2/M transition in fission yeast cell cycle"	"  The living cell is an open nonequilibrium biochemical system, where ATP
hydrolysis serves as the energy source for a wide range of intracellular
processes including the assurance for decision-making. In the fission yeast
cell cycle, the transition from G2 phase to M phase is triggered by the
activation of Cdc13/Cdc2 and Cdc25, and the deactivation of Wee1. Each of these
three events involves a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation (PdP) cycle, and
together they form a regulatory circuit with feedback loops. Almost all
quantitative models for cellular networks in the past have invalid
thermodynamics due to the assumption of irreversible enzyme kinetics. We
constructed a thermodynamically realistic kinetic model of the G2/M circuit,
and show that the phosphorylation energy ($\Delta G$), which is determined by
the cellular ATP/ADP ratio, critically controls the dynamics and the bistable
nature of Cdc2 activation. Using fission yeast nucleoplasmic extract (YNPE), we
are able to experimentally verify our model prediction that increased , being
synergistic to the accumulation of Cdc13, drives the activation of Cdc2.
Furthermore, Cdc2 activation exhibits bistability and hysteresis in response to
changes in phosphorylation energy. These findings suggest that adequate
maintenance of phosphorylation energy ensures the bistability and robustness of
the activation of Cdc2 in the G2/M transition. Free energy might play a
widespread role in biological decision-making processes, connecting
thermodynamics with information processing in biology.

Significantly, we find that the chemical shift spectrum is more consistent with
filamentous tau than full length solution based tau. We have also carried out
principle component analysis and find three basics groups: compact globules,
tadpoles, and extended hinging structures. To validate the adaptive box and our
force field choice, we have run limited simulations in a large conventional box
with varying force fields and find that our essential results are unchanged. We
also performed two simulations with the TIP4P-D water model, the effects of

aimed to be resolved with the consensus clades. Such a problem is proved to be
NP-hard. Various heuristics on local search, maximum parsimony, graph cut, etc.
lead to different supertree approaches, of which the most popular methods are
based on analyzing fixed size subtree topologies (such as triplets or
quartets). Time and space complexities of these methods, however, depend on the
subtree size considered. Our earlier proposed supertree method COSPEDTree, uses
evolutionary relationship among individual couplets (taxa pair), to produce
slightly conservative (not fully resolved) supertrees. Here we propose its
improved version COSPEDTree-II, which produces better resolved supertree with
lower number of missing branches, and incurs much lower running time. Results
on biological datasets show that COSPEDTree-II belongs to the category of high
performance and computationally efficient supertree methods.

film thickness and dynamics; better understanding of this process aids
understanding of dry eye syndrome which afflicts millions of people. We study a
mathematical model for tear film flow, evaporation, solutal transport and
fluorescence over the exposed ocular surface during the interblink. Transport
of the fluorescein ion by fluid flow in the tear film affects the intensity of
fluorescence via changes in concentration and tear film thickness. Evaporation
causes increased osmolarity and potential irritation over the ocular surface;
it also alters fluorescein concentration and thus fluorescence. Using thinning
rates from in vivo measurements together with thin film equations for flow and
transport of multiple solutes, we compute dynamic results for tear film
quantities of interest. We compare our computed intensity distributions with in
vivo observations. A number of experimental features are recovered by the
model.

  size of blood cells with marginal band across species"	"  The fast blood stream of animals is associated with large shear stresses.
Consequently, blood cells have evolved a special morphology and a specific
internal architecture allowing them to maintain their integrity over several
weeks. For instance, non-mammalian red blood cells, mammalian erythroblasts and
platelets have a peripheral ring of microtubules, called the marginal band,
that flattens the overall cell morphology by pushing on the cell cortex. In
this article, we model how the shape of these cells stems from the balance
between marginal band elasticity and cortical tension. We predict that the
diameter of the cell scales with the total microtubule polymer, and verify the
predicted law across a wide range of species. Our analysis also shows that the
combination of the marginal band rigidity and cortical tension increases the
ability of the cell to withstand forces without deformation. Finally, we model
the marginal band coiling that occurs during the disc-to-sphere transition
observed for instance at the onset of blood platelet activation. We show that
when cortical tension increases faster than crosslinkers can unbind, the
marginal band will coil, whereas if the tension increases slower, the marginal
band may shorten as microtubules slide relative to each other.

assert the quality and robustness of an image analysis pipeline, as well as be
used to train machine-learning image analysis procedures. We illustrate the
approach with closed curves corresponding to the microtubule ring present in

  fractional calculus approaches"	"  Nowadays, in our globalized world,the local and intercountry movements of
population have been increased. This situation makes it important for host
countries to do right predictions for the future population of their native
people as well as immigrant people. The knowledge of the attained number of
accumulated population is necessary for future planning, concerning to
education,health, job, housing, safety requirements, etc. In this work, for
updating historically well known formulas of population dynamics of a community
are revisited in the framework of compound growth and fractional calculus to
get more realistic relations. Within this context, for a time t, the population
evolution of a society which owns two different components is calculated.
Concomitant relations have been developed to provide a comparison between the
native population and the immigrant population that come into existence where
at each time interval a colonial population is joined. Eventually at time t,
the case where the native population becomes equal to immigrant population is
discussed. Moreover, the differential equation of a probability function for
the equilibrium state of accumulative population is obtained. It is seen that
the equilibrium solution can be written as a series in terms of Bernoulli
numbers. In the calculation of population dynamics, Mittag- Leffler(M-L)
function replaces the exponential function.

1611.00313	q-bio	q-bio.QM q-bio.NC	"A new foreperiod effect on single-trial phase coherence. Part I:
  existence and relevance"	"  Expecting events in time leads to more efficient behavior. A remarkable early
finding in the study of temporal expectancy is the foreperiod effect on
reaction times; i.e., the influence or reaction time of the time period between
a warning signal and an imperative stimulus to which subjects are instructed to
respond as quickly as possible. Recently it has been shown that the phase of
oscillatory activity preceding stimulus presentation is related to behavior.
Here we connect both of these findings by reporting a novel foreperiod effect
on the inter-trial phase coherence of the electroencephalogram (EEG) triggered
by stimuli to which subjects are instructed not to respond. Inter-trial phase
coherence has been used to describe regularities in phases of groups of trials
time locked to an event of interest. We propose a single-trial measure of
inter-trial phase coherence and prove its soundness. Equipped with this
measure, and using a multivariate decoding method, we demonstrate that the
foreperiod duration in and audiovisual attention-shifting task modulates
single-trial phase coherence. In principle, this modulation could be an
artifact of the decoding method used to detect it. We show that this is not the
case, since the modulation can also be observed using a simple averaging
method. We show that the strength of this modulation correlates with subject
behavior (both error rates and mean-reaction times). We anticipate that the new
foreperiod effect on inter-trial phase coherence, and the decoding method used
here to detect it, will be important tools to understand cognition at the
single-trial level. In Part II of this manuscript, we support this claim, by
showing that changes in attention modulate the strength of the new foreperiod
effect on a trial-by-trial basis.

1611.00545	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio.BM	"A multi-resolution model to capture both global fluctuations of an
  enzyme and molecular recognition in the ligand-binding site"	"  In multi-resolution simulations, different system components are
simultaneously modelled at different levels of resolution, these being smoothly
coupled together. In the case of enzyme systems, computationally expensive
atomistic detail is needed in the active site to capture the chemistry of
substrate binding. Global properties of the rest of the protein also play an
essential role, determining the structure and fluctuations of the binding site;
however, these can be modelled on a coarser level. Similarly, in the most
computationally efficient scheme only the solvent hydrating the active site
requires atomistic detail. We present a methodology to couple atomistic and
coarse-grained protein models, while solvating the atomistic part of the
protein in atomistic water. This allows a free choice of which protein and
solvent degrees of freedom to include atomistically, without loss of accuracy
in the atomistic description. This multi-resolution methodology can
successfully model stable ligand binding, and we further confirm its validity
via an exploration of system properties relevant to enzymatic function. In
addition to a computational speedup, such an approach can allow the
identification of the essential degrees of freedom playing a role in a given
process, potentially yielding new insights into biomolecular function.

1611.00610	q-bio	math.NA physics.comp-ph q-bio.BM	Variational Methods for Biomolecular Modeling	"  Structure, function and dynamics of many biomolecular systems can be
characterized by the energetic variational principle and the corresponding
systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). This principle allows us to
focus on the identification of essential energetic components, the optimal
parametrization of energies, and the efficient computational implementation of
energy variation or minimization. Given the fact that complex biomolecular
systems are structurally non-uniform and their interactions occur through
contact interfaces, their free energies are associated with various interfaces
as well, such as solute-solvent interface, molecular binding interface, lipid
domain interface, and membrane surfaces. This fact motivates the inclusion of
interface geometry, particular its curvatures, to the parametrization of free
energies. Applications of such interface geometry based energetic variational
principles are illustrated through three concrete topics: the multiscale
modeling of biomolecular electrostatics and solvation that includes the
curvature energy of the molecular surface, the formation of microdomains on
lipid membrane due to the geometric and molecular mechanics at the lipid
interface, and the mean curvature driven protein localization on membrane
surfaces. By further implicitly representing the interface using a phase field
function over the entire domain, one can simulate the dynamics of the interface
and the corresponding energy variation by evolving the phase field function,
achieving significant reduction of the number of degrees of freedom and
computational complexity. Strategies for improving the efficiency of
computational implementations and for extending applications to coarse-graining
or multiscale molecular simulations are outlined.

membrane-mediated interactions between neighboring proteins. Using the

demonstrate how the observed differences in protein structure can affect
membrane-mediated interactions and cooperativity among membrane proteins. We
find that distinct oligomeric states of MscL lead to distinct gateway states
for the clustering of MscL, and predict signatures of MscL structure and
spatial organization in the cooperative gating of MscL. Our modeling approach
establishes a quantitative relation between the observed shapes and cooperative

1611.00716	q-bio	q-bio.BM	"The assay of the hydration shell dynamics on the turnover of the active
  site of CF1-ATPase"	"  Previous kinetic models had assumed that the reaction medium was reacting at
random and without a turnover associated to thermodynamics exchanges, with a
rigid active site on the enzyme. The experimental studies show that coupling
factor 1 (CF1) from spinach chloroplasts has latent ATPase activity, which
become expressed after heat-treatment and incubation with calcium. The
sigmoidal kinetics observed on the competitive effect of glycerol on water
saturating a protein, suggests that the role of the hydration shell in the
catalytic mechanism of the CF1-ATPase, modify the number of water molecules
associated with the conformational turnover required for active site activity.
It is assume that the water associated to the hydrophilic state of the enzyme
produces a fit-in of the substrate to form (ES), follow by the catalytic action
with product formation (EP). This one induces the dissociation of water and
increases the hydrophobic attractions between R-groups. The latter, becomes the
form of the enzyme interacting with water to form the dissociated free enzyme
(E) and free product (P). Glycerol dependent suppression of the water dynamics
on two interacting sites configuration shows a change in the
H-bond-configuration. The thermodynamics modeling requires an energy
expenditure of about 4kcal/mol per each H-bond in turnover. Glycerol determined
a turnover of 14 molecules of water released from the active sites to reach the
inactive form of the enzyme. The entropy generated by turnover of the fit-in
and -out substrate and product from the protein could be dissipated-out of the
enzyme-water system itself. Coupling with the surrounding water clusters allows
to recreate H-bonds. This should involve a decrease in the number of H-bonds
present in the clusters. These changes in the mass action capability of the
water clusters could eventually become dissipated through a cooling effect.

dynamics of a honey bee colony with a continuous age distribution, and the
system is then extended to include the effects of a simplified infectious
disease. In the disease-free case we analytically derive the equilibrium age
distribution within the colony and propose a novel approach for determining the
global asymptotic stability of a reduced model. Furthermore, we present a
method for determining the basic reproduction number $R_0$ of the infection;
the method can be applied to other age-structured disease models with
interacting susceptible classes. The results of asymptotic stability indicate
that a honey bee colony suffering losses will recover naturally so long as the
cause of the losses is removed before the colony collapses. Our expression for
$R_0$ has potential uses in the tracking and control of an infectious disease
within a bee colony.

clusters with regular translational and orientational protein arrangements,
which may allow cells to modulate protein function. However, the physical
mechanisms yielding supramolecular organization and collective function of
membrane proteins remain largely unknown. Here we show that bilayer-mediated
elastic interactions between membrane proteins can yield regular and
distinctive lattice architectures of protein clusters, and may provide a link
between lattice architecture and lattice function. Using the mechanosensitive
channel of large conductance (MscL) as a model system, we obtain relations
between the shape of MscL and the supramolecular architecture of MscL lattices.
We predict that the tetrameric and pentameric MscL symmetries observed in
previous structural studies yield distinct lattice architectures of MscL
clusters and that, in turn, these distinct MscL lattice architectures yield
distinct lattice activation barriers. Our results suggest general physical
mechanisms linking protein symmetry, the lattice architecture of membrane
protein clusters, and the collective function of membrane protein lattices.

developed that takes advantage of next generation DNA sequencing to scan
connections between neurons into a set of DNA barcodes. Individual DNA
sequences called markers represent single neurons, while pairs of markers,
called barcodes contain information about connections. Here we propose a
strategy for 'copying' or 'cloning' connectivity contained in barcodes into a
clean slate tabula rasa network. We show that a one marker one cell (OMOC)
rule, which forces all markers with the same sequence to condense into the same
neuron, leads to fast and reliable formation of desired connectivity in a new
network. We show that OMOC rule yields convergence in a number of steps given
by a power law function of the network size. We thus propose that copying
network connectivity from one network to another is theoretically possible.

  proteins"	"  Hydrophobic thickness mismatch between integral membrane proteins and the
surrounding lipid bilayer can produce lipid bilayer thickness deformations.
Experiment and theory have shown that protein-induced lipid bilayer thickness
deformations can yield energetically favorable bilayer-mediated interactions
between integral membrane proteins, and large-scale organization of integral
membrane proteins into protein clusters in cell membranes. Within the continuum
elasticity theory of membranes, the energy cost of protein-induced bilayer
thickness deformations can be captured by considering compression and expansion
of the bilayer hydrophobic core, membrane tension, and bilayer bending,
resulting in biharmonic equilibrium equations describing the shape of lipid
bilayers for a given set of bilayer-protein boundary conditions. Here we
develop a combined analytic and numerical methodology for the solution of the
equilibrium elastic equations associated with protein-induced lipid bilayer
deformations. Our methodology allows accurate prediction of thickness-mediated
protein interactions for arbitrary protein symmetries at arbitrary protein
separations and relative orientations. We provide exact analytic solutions for
cylindrical integral membrane proteins with constant and varying hydrophobic
thickness, and develop perturbative analytic solutions for non-cylindrical
protein shapes. We complement these analytic solutions, and assess their
accuracy, by developing both finite element and finite difference numerical
solution schemes. Taken together, the work presented here puts into place an
analytic and numerical framework which allows calculation of bilayer-mediated
elastic interactions between integral membrane proteins for the complicated
protein shapes suggested by structural biology and at the small protein
separations most relevant for the crowded membrane environments provided by
living cells.

distinctive features, such as the hierarchical organization of protein
functions and the scarcity of annotated proteins for most biological functions.
We propose a multitask learning algorithm addressing both issues. Unlike
standard multitask algorithms, which use task (protein functions) similarity
information as a bias to speed up learning, we show that dissimilarity
information enforces separation of rare class labels from frequent class
labels, and for this reason is better suited for solving unbalanced protein
function prediction problems. We support our claim by showing that a multitask
extension of the label propagation algorithm empirically works best when the
task relatedness information is represented using a dissimilarity matrix as
opposed to a similarity matrix. Moreover, the experimental comparison carried
out on three model organism shows that our method has a more stable performance
in both ""protein-centric"" and ""function-centric"" evaluation settings.

a pattern, and the analysis of its composition is, currently, one of the
challenging problems of bioinformatics. In the present study, the possibility
of evaluating metagenome composition by DNA-marker methods is investigated.
These methods are based on using primers, short nucleic acid fragments. Each
primer picks out of the tested genome the fragment set specific just for this
genome, which is called its spectrum (for the given primer) and is used for
identifying the genome. The DNA-marker method, applied to a metagenome, also
gives its spectrum, which, obviously, represents the union of the spectra of
all genomes belonging to the metagenome. Thus each primer provides a projection
of the genomes and of the metagenome onto the corresponding spectra set. Here
we propose to apply the random projection (random primer) approach for
analyzing metagenome composition and present some estimates of the method
effectiveness for the case of Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
technology.

standard stationary Fleming-Viot process, so that the genealogy of $n$
uniformly sampled individuals is distributed as the Kingman $n$-coalescent. In
this note, we study some genealogical properties of this population when the
sample is conditioned to fall entirely into a subpopulation with most recent
common ancestor (MRCA) shorter than $\varepsilon$. First, using the comb
representation of the total genealogy (Lambert & Uribe Bravo 2016), we show
that the genealogy of the descendance of the MRCA of the sample on the
timescale $\varepsilon$ converges as $\varepsilon\to 0$. The limit is the
so-called Brownian coalescent point process (CPP) stopped at an independent
Gamma random variable with parameter $n$, which can be seen as the genealogy at
a large time of the total population of a rescaled critical birth-death
process, biased by the $n$-th power of its size. Secondly, we show that in this
limit the coalescence times of the $n$ sampled individuals are i.i.d. uniform
random variables in $(0,1)$. These results provide a coupling between two
standard models for the genealogy of a random exchangeable population: the

with Batch Normalization--to the problem of protein structure prediction. These
convolutional architectures make heavy use of multi-scale filter layers that
simultaneously compute features on several scales, and use residual connections
to prevent underfitting. Using a carefully modified version of these
architectures, we achieve state-of-the-art performance of 70.0% per amino acid
accuracy on the public CB513 benchmark dataset. Finally, we explore additions
from sequence-to-sequence learning, altering the model to make its predictions
conditioned on both the protein's amino acid sequence and its past secondary
structure labels. We introduce a new method of ensembling such a conditional
model with our convolutional model, an approach which reaches 70.6% Q8 accuracy
on CB513. We argue that these results can be further refined for larger boosts
in prediction accuracy through more sophisticated attempts to control
overfitting of conditional models. We aim to release the code for these
experiments as part of the TensorFlow repository.

1611.01585	q-bio	cs.DM cs.SI math.PR q-bio.PE	"Amplifiers and Suppressors of Selection for the Moran Process on
  Undirected Graphs"	"  We consider the classic Moran process modeling the spread of genetic
mutations, as extended to structured populations by Lieberman et al.\ (Nature,
2005). In this process, individuals are the vertices of a connected graph $G$.
Initially, there is a single mutant vertex, chosen uniformly at random. In each
step, a random vertex is selected for reproduction with a probability
proportional to its fitness: mutants have fitness $r>1$, while non-mutants have
fitness 1. The vertex chosen to reproduce places a copy of itself to a
uniformly random neighbor in $G$, replacing the individual that was there. The
process ends when the mutation either reaches fixation (i.e., all vertices are
mutants), or gets extinct. The principal quantity of interest is the
probability with which each of the two outcomes occurs.
  A problem that has received significant attention recently concerns the
existence of families of graphs, called strong amplifiers of selection, for
which the fixation probability tends to 1 as the order $n$ of the graph
increases, and the existence of strong suppressors of selection, for which this
probability tends to 0. For the case of directed graphs, it is known that both
strong amplifiers and suppressors exist. For the case of undirected graphs,
however, the problem has remained open, and the general belief has been that
neither strong amplifiers nor suppressors exist. In this paper we disprove this
belief, by providing the first examples of such graphs. The strong amplifier we
present has fixation probability $1-\tilde O(n^{-1/3})$, and the strong
suppressor has fixation probability $\tilde O(n^{-1/4})$. Both graph
constructions are surprisingly simple. We also prove a general upper bound of
$1-\tilde \Omega(n^{-1/3})$ on the fixation probability of any undirected
graph. Hence, our strong amplifier is existentially optimal.

  in the prosodic neural network"	"  Speech prosody enables communication of emotional intentions via modulation
of vocal intonations. Reciprocal interactions between superior temporal (STG)
and inferior frontal gyri (IFG) have been shown to anchor a neural network for
prosodic comprehension, which we refer to as the Prosody Neural Network (PNN).
Although the amygdala is critical for socio-emotional processing, its integral
functional and structural role in processing social information from speech
prosody as well as its role in the PNN is largely unexplored including
inconsistent recent empirical findings. Here, we used magnetoencephalography
and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging of white-matter pathways to establish
that the PNN is characterized by (1) a robust amygdala-cortical functional
connectivity that dynamically evolves as prosodic interpretation progresses,
(2) direct structural fiber connections between amygdala and STG/IFG traversing
a ventral white-matter pathway, and (3) robust amygdala-insula functional
connectivity and structural insula fiber projections to arcuate STG-IFG
connections. These findings support a role for functional and structural
amygdala-centric ventral pathways in combining speech features to form prosodic
percepts. They also highlight insula contributions to prosodic comprehension,
potentially via vertical integration of amygdala-centric ventral processing
into dorsal pathways responsible for prosodic motor articulation and speech
planning.

1611.01682	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Network model of human aging: frailty limits and information measures	"  Aging is associated with the accumulation of damage throughout a persons
life. Individual health can be assessed by the Frailty Index (FI). The FI is
calculated simply as the proportion $f$ of accumulated age related deficits
relative to the total, leading to a theoretical maximum of $f \leq 1$.
Observational studies have generally reported a much more stringent bound, with
$f \leq f_{max} <1$. The value of $f_{max}$ in observational studies appears to
be non-universal, but $f_{max} \approx 0.7$ is often reported. A previously
developed network model of individual aging was unable to recover $f_{max}<1$
while retaining the other observed phenomenology of increasing $f$ and
mortality rates with age. We have developed a computationally accelerated
network model that also allows us to tune the scale-free network exponent
$\alpha$. The network exponent $\alpha$ significantly affects the growth of
mortality rates with age. However, we are only able to recover $f_{max}$ by
also introducing a deficit sensitivity parameter $1-q$, which is equivalent to
a false-negative rate $q$. Our value of $q=0.3$ is comparable to finite
sensitivities of age-related deficits with respect to mortality that are often
reported in the literature. In light of non-zero $q$, we use mutual information
$I$ to provide a non-parametric measure of the predictive value of the FI with
respect to individual mortality. We find that $I$ is only modestly degraded by
$q<1$, and this degradation is mitigated when increasing number of deficits are
included in the FI. We also find that the information spectrum, i.e. the mutual
information of individual deficits vs connectivity, has an approximately
power-law dependence that depends on the network exponent $\alpha$. Mutual
information $I$ is therefore a useful tool for characterizing the network
topology of aging populations.

to develop an efficient vaccine. Malaria, a tropical disease caused by a
parasite of the genus Plasmodium, is one example. Bioinformatics has opened the
way to new lines of experimental investigation One example is reverse
vaccinology that aims to identify antigens that are capable of generating an
immune response in a given organism using in silico studies. In this study we
applied a reverse vaccinology methodology using a bioinformatics pipeline. We
obtained 45 potential linear B cells consensus epitopes from the whole genome
of P. falciparum 3D7 that can be used as candidates for malaria vaccines. The
direct implication of the results obtained is to open the way to experimentally
validate more epitopes to increase the efficiency of the available treatments
against malaria and to explore the methodology in other diseases.

this effect is limited to the local genomic region of the sweep in panmictic
populations, we find that in spatially-extended populations the combined
effects of many unlinked sweeps can affect patterns of ancestry (and therefore
neutral genetic diversity) across the whole genome. Even low rates of sweeps
can be enough to skew the spatial locations of ancestors such that neutral
mutations that occur in an individual living outside a small region in the
center of the range have virtually no chance of fixing in the population.

1611.01842	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Minimal-assumption inference from population-genomic data	"  Samples of multiple complete genome sequences contain vast amounts of
information about the evolutionary history of populations, much of it in the
associations among polymorphisms at different loci. Current methods that take
advantage of this linkage information rely on models of recombination and
coalescence, limiting the sample sizes and populations that they can analyze.
We introduce a method, Minimal-Assumption Genomic Inference of Coalescence
(MAGIC), that reconstructs key features of the evolutionary history, including
the distribution of coalescence times, by integrating information across
genomic length scales without using an explicit model of recombination,
demography or selection. Using simulated data, we show that MAGIC's performance
is comparable to PSMC' on single diploid samples generated with standard
coalescent and recombination models. More importantly, MAGIC can also analyze
arbitrarily large samples and is robust to changes in the coalescent and
recombination processes. Using MAGIC, we show that the inferred coalescence
time histories of samples of multiple human genomes exhibit inconsistencies
with a description in terms of an effective population size based on
single-genome data.

recovery speeds of N170 responses to faces and Chinese characters. The results
showed that recovery of N170 responses elicited by faces occurred between 1400

Chinese characters occurred between 600 and 800 ms after stimuli onset. These

functions. Their relevance has motivated intense research activity seeking to
characterize their sequence/structure/function relationships. However, the
conformational plasticity of these molecules hampers the application of
traditional structural approaches, and new tools and concepts are being
developed to address the challenges they pose. Small-Angle Scattering (SAS) is
a structural biology technique that probes the size and shape of disordered

of SAS can be compensated with specially designed computational tools and its
combined interpretation with complementary structural information. In this

  Aneurysms"	"  An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an enlargement of the abdominal aorta
which, if left untreated, can progressively widen and may rupture with fatal
consequences. In this paper, we determine an optimal treatment policy using
Markov decision process modeling. The policy is optimal with respect to the
number of quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) that are expected to be
accumulated during the remaining life of a patient. The new policy takes into
account factors that are ignored by the current clinical policy (e.g. the
life-expectancy and the age-dependent surgical mortality). The resulting
optimal policy is structurally different from the current policy. In
particular, the policy suggests that young patients with small aneurysms should
undergo surgery. The robustness of the policy structure is demonstrated using
simulations. A gain in the number of expected QALYs is shown, which indicates a
possibility of improved care for patients with AAAs.

ascertained by highly invasive, painful and sometimes risky tissue biopsy.
Interestingly, CKD-related abnormalities in kidney size can often be visualized
using ultrasound. Nevertheless, not only does the ellipsoid formula used today
underestimate true renal size but also the relation governing renal size and
collagen content remains unclear. We used coronal kidney sections from healthy
mice and mice with renal disease to develop a new technique for estimating the
renal parenchymal area. While treating the kidney as an ellipse with the major
axis the polar distance, this technique involves extending the minor axis into
the renal pelvis. The calculated renal parenchymal area is remarkably similar
to the measured area. Biochemically determined kidney collagen content revealed
a strong and positive correlation with the calculated renal parenchymal area.
The extent of renal scarring, i.e. kidney collagen content, can now be computed
by making just two renal axial measurements which can easily be accomplished
via noninvasive imaging of this organ.

  Game"	"  The construction of reciprocal relationships requires cooperative
interactions during the initial meetings. However, cooperative behavior with
strangers is risky because the strangers may be exploiters. In this study, we
show that people increase the likelihood of cooperativeness of strangers by
using lightweight non-risky interactions in risky situations based on the
analysis of a social network game (SNG). They can construct reciprocal
relationships in this manner. The interactions involve low-cost signaling
because they are not generated at any cost to the senders and recipients.
Theoretical studies show that low-cost signals are not guaranteed to be
reliable because the low-cost signals from senders can lie at any time.
However, people used low-cost signals to construct reciprocal relationships in
an SNG, which suggests the existence of mechanisms for generating reliable,
low-cost signals in human evolution.

  mix-and-read fluorescence assay"	"  Heparin is an important anticoagulant drug, about one billion doses are
produced annually. It is a polydisperse sulfated polysaccharide, and the
inherent heterogeneity makes the analysis of heparin difficult. The global
crisis resulting from adulterated heparin in 2008 has drawn renewed attention
to the challenges that are associated with the quality control and
characterization of this complex biological medicine from natural sources. The
present study addresses the need for simple and user-friendly analytical
methods for the fast and accurate quantification of heparin in complex
matrices. Direct quantification of heparin in the low microgram per mL range
was accomplished using a specific commercially available assay based on the
fluorescent molecular probe Heparin Red, simply by mixing the heparin
containing sample and a reagent solution in a 96-well microplate followed by
fluorescence readout. A screening of typical impurities in raw heparin
(selected other glycosaminoglycans, residual nucleic acids and proteins),
related to the extraction from animal tissues, as well as of components of the
urine matrix (inorganic salts, amino acids, trace proteins) revealed that these
compounds even in large excess have no or very little effect on the accuracy of
heparin determination. Heparin spike detection in urine, a biological
multicomponent matrix, also showed good accuracy. We envision applications of
this mix-and-read assay in the process and quality control in heparin
manufacturing, but also in pharmacokinetic studies as a convenient tool for
measuring of the urinary excretion of heparins.

  perspective"	"  A system level view of cellular processes for human and several organisms can
be cap- tured by analyzing molecular interaction networks. A molecular
interaction network formed of differentially expressed genes and their
interactions helps to understand key players behind disease development. So, if
the functions of these genes are blocked by altering their interactions, it
would have a great impact in controlling the disease. Due to this promising
consequence, the problem of inferring disease causing genes and their pathways
has attained a crucial position in computational biology research. However,
considering the huge size of interaction networks, executing computations can
be costly. Review of literatures shows that the methods proposed for finding
the set of disease causing genes could be assessed in terms of their accuracy
which a perfect algorithm would find. Along with accuracy, the time complexity
of the method is also important, as high time complexities would limit the
number of pathways that could be found within a pragmatic time interval.

  heating"	"  Magnetic hyperthermia is a new type of cancer treatment designed for
overcoming resistance to chemotherapy during the treatment of solid,
inaccessible human tumors. The main challenge of this technology is increasing
the local tumoral temperature with minimal side effects on the surrounding
healthy tissue. This work consists of an in vitro study that compared the
effect of hyperthermia in response to the application of exogenous heating
(EHT) sources with the corresponding effect produced by magnetic hyperthermia
(MHT) at the same target temperatures. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were
loaded with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and packed into dense pellets to
generate an environment that is crudely similar to that expected in solid
micro-tumors, and the above-mentioned protocols were applied to these cells.
These experiments showed that for the same target temperatures, MHT induces a
decrease in cell viability that is larger than the corresponding EHT, up to a
maximum difference of approximately 45\% at T = 46{\deg}C. An analysis of the
data in terms of temperature efficiency demonstrated that MHT requires an
average temperature that is 6{\deg}C lower than that required with EHT to
produce a similar cytotoxic effect. An analysis of electron microscopy images
of the cells after the EHT and MHT treatments indicated that the enhanced
effectiveness observed with MHT is associated with local cell destruction
triggered by the magnetic nano-heaters. The present study is an essential step
toward the development of innovative adjuvant anti-cancer therapies based on
local hyperthermia treatments using magnetic particles as nano-heaters.

  Escherichia coli"	"  The lactose operon in Escherichia coli was the first known gene regulatory
network, and it is frequently used as a prototype for new modeling paradigms.
Historically, many of these modeling frameworks use differential equations.
More recently, Stigler and Veliz-Cuba proposed a Boolean network model that
captures the bistability of the system and all of the biological steady states.
In this paper, we model the well-known arabinose operon in E. coli with a
Boolean network. This has several complex features not found in the lac operon,
such as a protein that is both an activator and repressor, a DNA looping
mechanism for gene repression, and the lack of inducer exclusion by glucose.
For 11 out of 12 choices of initial conditions, we use computational algebra
and Sage to verify that the state space contains a single fixed point that
correctly matches the biology. The final initial condition, medium levels of
arabinose and no glucose, successfully predicts the system's bistability.
Finally, we compare the state space under synchronous and asynchronous update,
and see that the former has several artificial cycles that go away under a
general asynchronous update.

have been filled up with fruit and vegetable residues. The anodes were realized
by means of a carbon fiber brush, while the cathodes were realized through a
graphite-based porous ceramic disk with Nafion membranes (117 Dupont). The
performances in terms of polarization curves and power production were assessed
according to different operating conditions: percentage of solid substrate
water dilution, adoption of freshwater and a 35mg/L NaCl water solution and,
finally, the effect of an initial potentiostatic growth.
  All TMFCs operated at low pH (pH$=3.0 \pm 0.5$), as no pH amendment was
carried out. Despite the harsh environmental conditions, our TMFCs showed a
Power Density (PD) ranging from 20 to 55~mW/m$^2 \cdot$kg$_{\text{waste}}$ and
a maximum CD of 20~mA/m$^2 \cdot$kg$_{\text{waste}}$, referred to the cathodic
surface. COD removal after a $28-$day period was about $45 \%$.
  The remarkably low pH values as well as the fouling of Nafion membrane very
likely limited TMFC performances. However, a scale-up estimation of our
reactors provides interesting values in terms of power production, compared to
actual anaerobic digestion plants. These results encourage further studies to
characterize the graphite-based porous ceramic cathodes and to optimize the
global TMFC performances, as they may provide a valid and sustainable
alternative to anaerobic digestion technologies.

an endemic equilibrium by escaping hosts' acquired immunity. For such diseases,
multiple biological, environmental and population-level mechanisms determine
the dynamics of the outbreak, including pathogen's epidemiological traits (e.g.
transmissibility, infectious period and duration of immunity), seasonality,
interaction with other circulating strains and hosts' mixing and spatial
fragmentation. Here, we study a susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible
model on a metapopulation where individuals are distributed in subpopulations
connected via a network of mobility flows. Through extensive numerical
simulations, we explore the phase space of pathogen's persistence and map the
dynamical regimes of the pathogen following emergence. Our results show that
spatial fragmentation and mobility play a key role in the persistence of the
disease whose maximum is reached at intermediate mobility values. We describe
the occurrence of different phenomena including local extinction and emergence
of epidemic waves, and assess the conditions for large scale spreading.
Findings are highlighted in reference to previous works and to real scenarios.
Our work uncovers the crucial role of hosts' mobility on the ecological
dynamics of rapidly mutating pathogens, opening the path for further studies on
disease ecology in the presence of a complex and heterogeneous environment.

  mechanical load and ATP concentration"	"  Based on a detailed crossbridge model for individual myosin II motors, we
systematically study the influence of mechanical load and adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) concentration on small myosin II ensembles made from
different isoforms. For skeletal and smooth muscle myosin II, which are often
used in actomyosin gels that reconstitute cell contractility, fast forward
movement is restricted to a small region of phase space with low mechanical
load and high ATP concentration, which is also characterized by frequent
ensemble detachment. At high load, these ensembles are stalled or move
backwards, but forward motion can be restored by decreasing ATP concentration.
In contrast, small ensembles of nonmuscle myosin II isoforms, which are found
in the cytoskeleton of nonmuscle cells, are hardly affected by ATP
concentration due to the slow kinetics of the bound states. For all isoforms,
the thermodynamic efficiency of ensemble movement increases with decreasing ATP
concentration, but this effect is weaker for the nonmuscle myosin II isoforms.

  brain posed at criticality"	"  Synchronization of brain activity fluctuations is believed to represent
communication between spatially distant neural processes. These inter-areal
functional interactions develop in the background of a complex network of
axonal connections linking cortical and sub-cortical neurons, termed the human
""structural connectome"". Theoretical considerations and experimental evidence
support the view that the human brain can be modeled as a system operating at a
critical point between ordered (sub-critical) and disordered (super-critical)
phases. Here, we explore the hypothesis that pathologies resulting from brain
injury of different etiology are related to the model of a critical brain. For
this purpose, we investigate how damage to the integrity of the structural
connectome impacts on the signatures of critical dynamics. Adopting a hybrid
modeling approach combining an empirical weighted network of human structural
connections with a conceptual model of critical dynamics, we show that lesions
located at highly transited connections progressively displace the model
towards the sub-critical regime. The topological properties of the nodes and
links are of less importance when considered independently of their weight in
the network. We observe that damage to midline hubs such as the middle and
posterior cingulate cortex is most crucial for the disruption of criticality in
the model. However, a similar effect can be achieved by targeting less
transited nodes and links whose connection weights add up to an equivalent
amount. This implies that brain pathology does not necessarily arise due to
insult targeted at well-connected areas and that inter- subject variability
could obscure lesions located at non-hub regions. Finally, we discuss the
predictions of our model in the context of clinical studies of traumatic brain
injury and neurodegenerative disorders.

  Statistically-Equivalent Feature Subsets"	"  The statistically equivalent signature (SES) algorithm is a method for
feature selection inspired by the principles of constrained-based learning of
Bayesian Networks. Most of the currently available feature-selection methods
return only a single subset of features, supposedly the one with the highest
predictive power. We argue that in several domains multiple subsets can achieve
close to maximal predictive accuracy, and that arbitrarily providing only one
has several drawbacks. The SES method attempts to identify multiple, predictive
feature subsets whose performances are statistically equivalent. Under that
respect SES subsumes and extends previous feature selection algorithms, like
the max-min parent children algorithm. SES is implemented in an homonym
function included in the R package MXM, standing for mens ex machina, meaning
'mind from the machine' in Latin. The MXM implementation of SES handles several
data-analysis tasks, namely classification, regression and survival analysis.
In this paper we present the SES algorithm, its implementation, and provide
examples of use of the SES function in R. Furthermore, we analyze three
publicly available data sets to illustrate the equivalence of the signatures
retrieved by SES and to contrast SES against the state-of-the-art feature
selection method LASSO. Our results provide initial evidence that the two
methods perform comparably well in terms of predictive accuracy and that
multiple, equally predictive signatures are actually present in real world
data.

while it is being probed by a train of short pulses with stochastic intervals.
Features of the measured MI at various time shifts between the stimulation and
the response are used to characterize the predictive properties of the retina.
By varying the statistical properties of the pulse train, our experiments show
that a retina has the ability to predict future events of the stimulation if
the information rate of the stimulation is low enough. Also, this predictive
property of the retina occurs at a time scale similar to the well established
anticipative phenomenon of omitted stimulus response in a retina. Furthermore,
a retina can make use of its predictive ability to distinguish between time

to have a lower BMD than the SQ(+)& ABQ(-) subjects. In subjects with SQ
grade-2 deformity, those were also ABQ(+) tended to have a lower BMD than those

while SQ(+)&ABQ(+)subjects tended to have lowest BMD. Conclusion: ABQ method
may be more sensitive to VF associated mild lower BMD than SQ method.

1611.03605	q-bio	q-bio.NC	A Possible Role for Entropy in Creative Cognition	"  This paper states the case for applying the conceptual and analytic tools
associated with the study of entropy in physical systems to cognition, focusing
on creative cognition. It is proposed that minds modify their contents and
adapt to their environments to minimize psychological entropy:
arousal-provoking uncertainty, which can be experienced negatively as anxiety,
or positively as a wellspring for creativity (or both). Thus, intrinsically
motivated creativity begins with detection of high psychological entropy
material (e.g., a question or inconsistency), which provokes uncertainty and is
arousal-inducing. This material is recursively considering from new contexts
until it is sufficiently restructured that arousal dissipates and entropy
reaches an acceptable level. Restructuring involves neural synchrony and
dynamic binding, and may be facilitated by temporarily shifting to a more
associative mode of thought. The creative outcome may similarly induce
restructuring in others, and thereby contribute to the cultural evolution of
more nuanced understandings. Thus, the concept of entropy could play a unifying
role in cognitive science as a driver of thought and action, and in cultural
studies as the driver of the creative innovations that fuel cultural evolution.
The paper concludes with an invitation for cross-disciplinary exploration of
this potential new arena of entropy studies.

theory. These include Fano interference between first- and second-order

1611.03890	q-bio	physics.soc-ph cs.SI physics.data-an q-bio.QM	A Theory of Taxonomy	"  A taxonomy is a standardized framework to classify and organize items into
categories. Hierarchical taxonomies are ubiquitous, ranging from the
classification of organisms to the file system on a computer. Characterizing
the typical distribution of items within taxonomic categories is an important
question with applications in many disciplines. Ecologists have long sought to
account for the patterns observed in species-abundance distributions (the
number of individuals per species found in some sample), and computer
scientists study the distribution of files per directory. Is there a universal
statistical distribution describing how many items are typically found in each
category in large taxonomies? Here, we analyze a wide array of large,
real-world datasets -- including items lost and found on the New York City
transit system, library books, and a bacterial microbiome -- and discover such
an underlying commonality. A simple, non-parametric branching model that
randomly categorizes items and takes as input only the total number of items
and the total number of categories successfully reproduces the abundance
distributions in these datasets. This result may shed light on patterns in
species-abundance distributions long observed in ecology. The model also
predicts the number of taxonomic categories that remain unrepresented in a
finite sample.

1611.04023	q-bio	q-bio.NC cs.CV cs.NE	Sparsey: Event Recognition via Deep Hierarchical Spare Distributed Codes	"  Visual cortex's hierarchical, multi-level organization is captured in many
biologically inspired computational vision models, the general idea being that
progressively larger scale, more complex spatiotemporal features are
represented in progressively higher areas. However, most earlier models use
localist representations (codes) in each representational field, which we
equate with the cortical macrocolumn (mac), at each level. In localism, each
represented feature/event (item) is coded by a single unit. Our model, Sparsey,
is also hierarchical but crucially, uses sparse distributed coding (SDC) in
every mac in all levels. In SDC, each represented item is coded by a small
subset of the mac's units. SDCs of different items can overlap and the size of
overlap between items can represent their similarity. The difference between
localism and SDC is crucial because SDC allows the two essential operations of
associative memory, storing a new item and retrieving the best-matching stored
item, to be done in fixed time for the life of the model. Since the model's
core algorithm, which does both storage and retrieval (inference), makes a
single pass over all macs on each time step, the overall model's
storage/retrieval operation is also fixed-time, a criterion we consider
essential for scalability to huge datasets. A 2010 paper described a
nonhierarchical version of this model in the context of purely spatial pattern
processing. Here, we elaborate a fully hierarchical model (arbitrary numbers of
levels and macs per level), describing novel model principles like progressive
critical periods, dynamic modulation of principal cells' activation functions
based on a mac-level familiarity measure, representation of multiple
simultaneously active hypotheses, a novel method of time warp invariant
recognition, and we report results showing learning/recognition of
spatiotemporal patterns.

  edge-based compartmental to pairwise models"	"  This paper presents a novel extension of the edge-based compartmental model
for epidemics with arbitrary distributions of transmission and recovery times.
Using the message passing approach we also derive a new pairwise-like model for
epidemics with Markovian transmission and an arbitrary recovery period. The new
pairwise-like model allows one to formally prove that the message passing and
edge-based compartmental models are equivalent in the case of Markovian
transmission and arbitrary recovery processes. The edge-based and message
passing models are conjectured to also be equivalent for arbitrary transmission
processes; we show the first step of a full proof of this. The new
pairwise-like model encompasses many existing well-known models that can be
obtained by appropriate reductions. It is also amenable to a relatively
straightforward numerical implementation. We test the theoretical results by
comparing the numerical solutions of the various pairwise-like models to
results based on explicit stochastic network simulations.

  Intrinsically Disordered Regulatory Domain of Calcineurin"	"  Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and proteins with intrinsically
disordered regions (IDRs) govern a daunting number of physiological processes.
For such proteins, molecular mechanisms governing their interactions with
proteins involved in signal transduction pathways remain unclear. Using the
folded, calcium-loaded calmodulin (CaM) interaction with the calcineurin
regulatory IDP as a prototype for IDP-mediated signal transduction events, we
uncover the interplay of IDP structure and electrostatic interactions in
determining the kinetics of protein-protein association. Using an array of
biophysical approaches including stopped-flow and computational simulation, we
quantify the relative contributions of electrostatic interactions and
conformational ensemble characteristics in determining association kinetics of
calmodulin (CaM) and the calcineurin regulatory domain (CaN RD). Our chief
findings are that CaM/CN RD association rates are strongly dependent on ionic
strength and that observed rates are largely determined by the
electrostatically-driven interaction strength between CaM and the narrow CaN RD
calmodulin recognition domain. These studies highlight a molecular mechanism of
controlling signal transduction kinetics that may be utilized in wide-ranging
signaling cascades that involve IDPs.

  microtubules"	"  Dynamic instability of microtubules is considered using frameworks of
non-linear thermodynamics and non-equilibrium reaction-diffusion systems.
Stochastic assembly/disassembly phases in the polymerization dynamics of
microtubules are treated as a result of collective clusterization of
microdefects (holes in structure). The model explains experimentally observed
power law dependence of catastrophe frequency from the microtubule growth rate.
Additional reaction-diffusion-precipitation model is developed to account for
kinetic limitations in microtubule dynamics. It is shown that large scale
periodic microtubules length fluctuations are accompanied by concentration
autowaves. We built corresponding parametric diagram mapping areas of
stationary, non-stationary and metastable solutions. The loss of stability for
the stationary solutions happens through bifurcation of Andronov-Hopf. Using
parametric diagram we classify cytostatic effect of microtubule stabilizing
drugs in four major classes and analyze their compatibility and possible
synergistic effect for cancer treatment therapy.

1611.04193	q-bio	q-bio.QM	"Patterns of Selection of Human Movements III: Energy Efficiency,
  Mechanical Advantage, and Walking Gait"	"  Human movements are physical processes combining the classical mechanics of
the human body moving in space and the biomechanics of the muscles generating
the forces acting on the body under sophisticated sensory-motor control. One
way to characterize movement performance is through measures of energy
efficiency that relate the mechanical energy of the body and metabolic energy
expended by the muscles. We expect the practical utility of such measures to be
greater when human subjects execute movements that maximize energy efficiency.
We therefore seek to understand if and when subjects select movements with that
maximizing energy efficiency. We proceed using a model-based approach to
describe movements which perform a task requiring the body to add or remove
external mechanical work to or from an object. We use the specific example of
walking gaits doing external mechanical work by pulling a cart, and estimate
the relationship between the avg. walking speed and avg. step length. In the
limit where no external work is done, we find that the estimated maximum energy
efficiency walking gait is much slower than the walking gaits healthy adults
typically select. We then modify the situation of the walking gait by
introducing an idealized mechanical device that creates an adjustable
mechanical advantage. The walking gaits that maximize the energy efficiency
using the optimal mechanical advantage are again much slower than the walking
gaits healthy adults typically select. We finally modify the situation so that
the avg. walking speed is fixed and derive the pattern of the avg. step length
and mechanical advantage that maximize energy efficiency.

  Spike Counts Odds of Inherent versus Observed Over-dispersion"	"  The repeated presentation of an identical visual stimulus in the receptive
field of a neuron may evoke different spiking patterns at each trial.
Probabilistic methods are essential to understand the functional role of this
variance within the neural activity. In that case, a Poisson process is the
most common model of trial-to-trial variability. For a Poisson process, the
variance of the spike count is constrained to be equal to the mean,
irrespective of the duration of measurements. Numerous studies have shown that
this relationship does not generally hold. Specifically, a majority of
electrophysiological recordings show an "" over-dispersion "" effect: Responses
that exhibit more inter-trial variability than expected from a Poisson process
alone. A model that is particularly well suited to quantify over-dispersion is
the Negative-Binomial distribution model. This model is well-studied and widely
used but has only recently been applied to neuroscience. In this paper, we
address three main issues. First, we describe how the Negative-Binomial
distribution provides a model apt to account for overdispersed spike counts.
Second, we quantify the significance of this model for any neurophysiological
data by proposing a statistical test, which quantifies the odds that
over-dispersion could be due to the limited number of repetitions (trials). We
apply this test to three neurophysiological tests along the visual pathway.
Finally, we compare the performance of this model to the Poisson model on a
population decoding task. We show that the decoding accuracy is improved when
accounting for over-dispersion, especially under the hypothesis of tuned
over-dispersion.

mantle volume. As a result of such volume loss, the geometrical arrangement of
the regions on the cortical surface is expected to be altered in comparison to
healthy brains. Here we present a novel method to study the alterations in
brain cortical surface geometry in Parkinson's disease (PD) subjects with a
\emph{Geometry Networks (GN)} framework. The local geometrical arrangement of
the cortical surface is captured as the 3D coordinates of the centroids of
anatomically defined parcels on the surface. The inter-regional distance
between cortical patches is the signal of interest and is captured as a
geometry network. We study its topology by computing the dimensionality of
simplicial complexes induced on a filtration of binary undirected networks for
each geometry network. In a permutation statistics test, a statistically
significant ($p<0.05$) difference was observed in the homology features between
PD and healthy control groups highlighting its potential to differentiate
between the groups and their potential utility in disease diagnosis.

for its strong adaptability and long history of cultivation. However, seldom
has any research touched on its physiological resistance mechanism. In this
experiment, the impatiens is selected from those which experienced aerospace
mutation and thereafter 12 years of cultivation and breeding. Therefore, it is
superior to the non-mutagenized impatiens in terms of drought resistance and
demonstrates tremendous differences from the normal impatiens in physiology,
which intrigues scholars to search for the underlying reasons . Methods: By
reference to Impatiens balsamina L,this experiment uses mutagenized impatiens
seeds, processed by PEG-6000 in different solution concentration, to measure
the germination rate of impatiens, its relative enzymatic activity and
expression differences between gene SoS2 and gene RD29b in the drought lower
reaches. Key results: Under simulated drought stress, there is no distinct
difference between the mutagenized impatiens and the normal impatiens in terms
of germination rate. But by measuring the root tillers and the length, the
relative enzymatic activity, MDA, and the expression differences between gene
SoS2 and gene RD29b in the drought lower reaches, it is verified that the
mutagenized impatiens has more advantages than the normal impatiens, and it Can
further cultivate become drought resistance varieties impatiens. Conclusions:
In this experiment,which is a positive mutation, the mutagenized impatiens
improves drought resistance through radiative mutation. The so obtained
impatiens is more pleasing in sight in terms of color and shape and has higher
application value in garden virescence.

elusive for many voltage gated ion channels, such as eukaryotic sodium ones.
The understanding of channel functions is a pressing issue in molecular
biophysics and biology. Mathematical modeling, computation and analysis of
membrane channel charge transport have become an emergent field and give rise
to significant contributions to our understanding of ion channel gating and
function. This review summarizes recent progresses and outlines remaining
challenges in mathematical modeling, simulation and analysis of ion channel
charge transport. One of our focuses is the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) model
and its generalizations. Specifically, the basic framework of the PNP system
and some of its extensions, including size effects, ion-water interactions,
coupling with density functional theory and relation to fluid flow models. A
reduced theory, the Poisson- Boltzmann-Nernst-Planck (PBNP) model, and a
differential geometry based ion transport model are also discussed. For proton
channel, a multiscale and multiphysics Poisson-Boltzmann-Kohn-Sham (PBKS) model
is presented. We show that all of these ion channel models can be cast into a
unified variational multiscale framework with a macroscopic continuum domain of
the solvent and a microscopic discrete domain of the solute. The main strategy
is to construct a total energy functional of a charge transport system to
encompass the polar and nonpolar free energies of solvation and chemical
potential related energies. Current computational algorithms and tools for
numerical simulations and results from mathematical analysis of ion channel
systems are also surveyed.

an algorithm that not only computes the Unifrac distance in linear time and
space, but also simultaneously finds which operational taxonomic units are

algorithm, called EMDUnifrac, to determine why given samples are different, not
just if they are different, and with no added computational burden. EMDUnifrac
can be utilized on any distribution on a tree, and so is particularly suitable
to analyzing both operational taxonomic units derived from amplicon sequencing,
as well as community profiles resulting from classifying whole genome shotgun
metagenomes. The EMDUnifrac source code (written in python) is freely available

spatially registered probes that number in the hundreds of thousands across
multiplechromosomes. The measured probes are by themselves less interesting
scientifically; instead scientists seek to discover biologically interpretable
genomic regions comprised of contiguous groups of probes which may act as
biomarkers of disease or serve as a dimension-reducing pre-processing step for
downstream analyses. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised feature
learning technique which maps technological units (probes) to biological units
(genomic regions) that are common across all subjects. We use ideas from fusion
penalties and convex clustering to introduce a method for Spatial Convex
Clustering, or SpaCC. Our method is specifically tailored to detecting
multi-subject regions of methylation, but we also test our approach on the
well-studied problem of detecting segments of copy number variation. We
formulate our method as a convex optimization problem, develop a massively
parallelizable algorithm to find its solution, and introduce automated
approaches for handling missing values and determining tuning parameters.
Through simulation studies based on real methylation and copy number variation
data, we show that SpaCC exhibits significant performance gains relative to
existing methods. Finally, we illustrate SpaCC's advantages as a pre-processing
technique that reduces large-scale genomics data into a smaller number of
genomic regions through several cancer epigenetics case studies on subtype
discovery, network estimation, and epigenetic-wide association.

reproduce, the genetic material must be doubled, separated and placed into two
new daughter cells, each containing a complete set of chromosomes and
organelles. In mitosis, transition from one process to the next is guided by
intricate surveillance mechanisms, known as the mitotic checkpoints.
Dis-regulation of cell division through checkpoint malfunction can lead to
developmental defects and contribute to the development or progression of
tumors. This review approaches two important mitotic checkpoints, the spindle
assembly checkpoint (SAC) and the spindle position checkpoint (SPOC). The
highly conserved spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) controls the onset of
anaphase by preventing premature segregation of the sister chromatids of the
duplicated genome, to the spindle poles. In contrast, the spindle position
checkpoint (SPOC), in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, ensures that during
asymmetric cell division mitotic exit does not occur until the spindle is
properly aligned with the cell polarity axis. Although there are no known
homologs, there is indication that functionally similar checkpoints exist also
in animal cells.

in the thalamo-cortical system, promoting a drastic reduction in awareness and
level of consciousness. There is experimental evidence that general anesthesia
impacts large scale functional networks leading to alterations in the brain
state. However, the way anesthetics affect the structure assumed by functional
connectivity in different brain regions have not been reported yet. Within this
context, the present study has sought to characterize the functional brain
networks respective to the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes. In
this experiment, electro-physiological neural activity was recorded through the
use of a dense ECoG-electrode array positioned directly over the cortical
surface of an old world monkey of the species Macaca fuscata. Networks were
serially estimated over time at each five seconds, while the animal model was
under controlled experimental conditions of an anesthetic induction process. In
each one of the four cortical brain lobes, prominent alterations on distinct
properties of the networks evidenced a transition in the networks architecture,
which occurred within about one and a half minutes after the administration of
the anesthetics. The characterization of functional brain networks performed in
this study represents important experimental evidence and brings new knowledge
towards the understanding of neural correlates of consciousness in terms of the
structure and properties of the functional brain networks.

  BubR1"	"  The highly conserved spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures that the
sister chromatids of the duplicated genome are not separated and distributed to
the spindle poles before all chromosomes have been properly linked to the
microtubules of the mitotic spindle. Biochemically, the SAC delays cell cycle
progression by preventing activation of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C)
or cyclosome; whose activation by Cdc20 is required for sister-chromatid
separation, which marks the transition into anaphase. In response to activation
of the checkpoint, various species control the activity of both APC/C and
Cdc20. However, the underlying regulatory pathways remain largely elusive. In
this study, five possible model variants of APC/C regulation were constructed,
namely BubR1, Mad2, MCC, MCF2 and an all-pathways model variant. These models
are validated with experimental data from the literature. A wide range of
parameter values have been tested to find critical values of the APC binding
rate. The results show that all variants are able to capture the wild type
behaviour of the APC. However, only one model variant, which included both MCC
as well as BubR1 as potent inhibitors of the APC, was able to reproduce both
wild type and mutant type behaviour of APC regulation. The presented work has
successfully distinguished between five competing dynamical models of the same
biological system using a systems biology approach. Furthermore, the results
suggest that systems-level approach is vital for molecular biology and could
also be used for compare the pathways of relevance with the objective to
generate hypotheses and improve our understanding.

stochastic SIR (susceptible $\to$ infected $\to$ removed) model for the spread
of an epidemic amongst a population of individuals with a random network of
social contacts that is also partitioned into households. Under various vaccine
action models, we consider both household-based vaccination schemes, in which
the way in which individuals are chosen for vaccination depends on the size of
the households in which they reside, and acquaintance vaccination, which
targets individuals of high degree in the social network. For both types of
vaccination scheme, assuming a large population with few initial infectives, we
derive a threshold parameter which determines whether or not a large outbreak
can occur and also the probability and fraction of the population infected by
such an outbreak. The performance of these schemes is studied numerically,
focusing on the influence of the household size distribution and the degree
distribution of the social network. We find that acquaintance vaccination can
significantly outperform the best household-based scheme if the degree
distribution of the social network is heavy-tailed. For household-based
schemes, when the vaccine coverage is insufficient to prevent a major outbreak
and the vaccine is imperfect, we find situations in which both the probability
and size of a major outbreak under the scheme which minimises the threshold
parameter are \emph{larger} than in the scheme which maximises the threshold
parameter.

renormalization group (SPDERG), by clarifying similarities and differences. In
the present demanding situation, we directly renormalize the bare initial
condition value for the substrate. Our main results are: i) the 2nd order
SPDERG uniform approximations to the correct solutions contain, up to 1st
order, the same outer components as the known perturbation expansion ones; ii)
the differential equation to be solved for the derivation of the 1st order
outer substrate component is simpler within the SPDERG approach; iii) the
approximations better reproduce the numerical solutions of the original problem
in a region encompassing the matching one, because of the 2nd order terms in
the inner components, calculated here for the first time to our knowledge: iv)
the refined SPDERG uniform approximations, that we propose, give the correct
asymptotically vanishing solutions, too, and allow to obtain results nearly
indistinguishable from the solutions of the original problem in a large part of
the whole relevant time window, even in the studied unfavourable kinetic
constant case, for an expansion parameter value as large as {\epsilon} = 0.5.

  design with exactly solvable models"	"  Inverse statistical approaches to determine protein structure and function
from Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA) are emerging as powerful tools in
computational biology. However the underlying assumptions of the relationship
between the inferred effective Potts Hamiltonian and real protein structure and
energetics remain untested so far. Here we use lattice protein model (LP) to
benchmark those inverse statistical approaches. We build MSA of highly stable
sequences in target LP structures, and infer the effective pairwise Potts
Hamiltonians from those MSA. We find that inferred Potts Hamiltonians reproduce
many important aspects of 'true' LP structures and energetics. Careful analysis
reveals that effective pairwise couplings in inferred Potts Hamiltonians depend
not only on the energetics of the native structure but also on competing folds;
in particular, the coupling values reflect both positive design (stabilization
of native conformation) and negative design (destabilization of competing
folds). In addition to providing detailed structural information, the inferred
Potts models used as protein Hamiltonian for design of new sequences are able
to generate with high probability completely new sequences with the desired
folds, which is not possible using independent-site models. Those are
remarkable results as the effective LP Hamiltonians used to generate MSA are
not simple pairwise models due to the competition between the folds. Our
findings elucidate the reasons for the success of inverse approaches to the
modelling of proteins from sequence data, and their limitations.

1611.05443	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Bridging the Gap between Individuality and Joint Improvisation in the
  Mirror Game"	"  Extensive experiments in Human Movement Science suggest that solo motions are
characterized by unique features that define the individuality or motor
signature of people. While interacting with others, humans tend to
spontaneously coordinate their movement and unconsciously give rise to joint
improvisation. However, it has yet to be shed light on the relationship between
individuality and joint improvisation. By means of an ad-hoc virtual agent, in
this work we uncover the internal mechanisms of the transition from solo to
joint improvised motion in the mirror game, a simple yet effective paradigm for
studying interpersonal human coordination. According to the analysis of
experimental data, normalized segments of velocity in solo motion are regarded
as individual motor signature, and the existence of velocity segments
possessing a prescribed signature is theoretically guaranteed. In this work, we
first develop a systematic approach based on velocity segments to generate
\emph{in-silico} trajectories of a given human participant playing solo. Then
we present an online algorithm for the virtual player to produce joint
improvised motion with another agent while exhibiting some desired kinematic
characteristics, and to account for movement coordination and mutual adaptation
during joint action tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed approach
succeeds in revealing the kinematic features transition from solo to joint
improvised motions, thus revealing the existence of a tight relationship
between individuality and joint improvisation.

roots. In other words, the quantity of interest is the number of tandem
duplication operations of the form $\seq x = \seq a \seq b \seq c \to \seq y =
\seq a \seq b \seq b \seq c$, where $\seq x$ and $\seq y$ are sequences and
$\seq a$, $\seq b$, and $\seq c$ are their substrings, needed to generate a
binary sequence of length $n$ starting from a square-free sequence from the set
$\{0,1,01,10,010,101\}$. This problem is a restricted case of finding the
duplication/deduplication distance between two sequences, defined as the
minimum number of duplication and deduplication operations required to
transform one sequence to the other. We consider both exact and approximate
tandem duplications. For exact duplication, denoting the maximum distance to
the root of a sequence of length $n$ by $f(n)$, we prove that $f(n)=\Theta(n)$.
For the case of approximate duplication, where a $\beta$-fraction of symbols
may be duplicated incorrectly, we show that the maximum distance has a sharp
transition from linear in $n$ to logarithmic at $\beta=1/2$. We also study the
duplication distance to the root for sequences with a given root and for
special classes of sequences, namely, the de Bruijn sequences, the Thue-Morse
sequence, and the Fibbonaci words. The problem is motivated by genomic tandem
duplication mutations and the smallest number of tandem duplication events
required to generate a given biological sequence.

electronic devices is of paramount importance for exploiting the full potential
of neural prostheses. Current microelectrode technologies for recording
electrical activity, however, evidence important shortcomings, e.g. challenging
high density integration. Solution-gated field-effect transistors (SGFETs), on
the other hand, could overcome these shortcomings if a suitable transistor
material were available. Graphene is particularly attractive due to its
biocompatibility, chemical stability, flexibility, low intrinsic electronic
noise and high charge carrier mobilities. Here, we report on the use of an
array of flexible graphene SGFETs for recording spontaneous slow waves, as well
as visually evoked and also pre-epileptic activity in vivo in rats. The
flexible array of graphene SGFETs allows mapping brain electrical activity with
excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), suggesting that this technology could
lay the foundation for a future generation of in vivo recording implants.

transient and long term dynamics of Dengue incidences and its environmental
correlates in Ahmedabad city in western India from 2005-2012. We calculate the
reproduction number $R_p$ using the growth rate of post monsoon Dengue
outbreaks and biological parameters like host and vector incubation periods and
vector mortality rate, and its uncertainties are estimated through Monte-Carlo
simulations by sampling parameters from their respective probability
distributions. Reduction in Female Aedes mosquito density required for an
effective prevention of Dengue outbreaks is also calculated. The non stationary
pattern of Dengue incidences and its climatic correlates like rainfall
temperature is analyzed through Wavelet based methods. We find that the mean
time lag between peak of monsoon and Dengue is 9 weeks. Monsoon and Dengue
cases are phase locked from 2008-2012 in the 16-32 weeks band. The duration of
post monsoon outbreak has been increasing every year, especially post 2008,
even though the intensity and duration of monsoon has been decreasing.
Temperature and Dengue incidences show correlations in the same band, but phase

oscillators is called a chimera state. We study such chimera states in a
network of neurons without any direct interactions but connected through
another medium of neurons, forming a multilayer structure. The upper layer is
thus made up of uncoupled neurons and the lower layer plays the role of a
medium through which the neurons in the upper layer share information among
each other. Hindmarsh-Rose neurons with square wave bursting dynamics are
considered as nodes in both layers. In addition, we also discuss the existence
of chimera states in presence of inter layer heterogeneity. The neurons in the
bottom layer are globally connected through electrical synapses, while across
the two layers chemical synapses are formed. According to our research, the
competing effects of these two types of synapses can lead to chimera states in
the upper layer of uncoupled neurons. Remarkably, we find a density-dependent
threshold for the emergence of chimera states in uncoupled neurons, similar to
the quorum sensing transition to a synchronized state. Finally, we examine the
impact of both homogeneous and heterogeneous inter-layer information
transmission delays on the observed chimera states over a wide parameter space.

  in site-specific invasion rates"	"  Global, population-wide oscillations in models of cyclic dominance may result
in the collapse of biodiversity due to the accidental extinction of one species
in the loop. Previous research has shown that such oscillations can emerge if
the interaction network has small-world properties, and more generally, because
of long-range interactions among individuals or because of mobility. But
although these features are all common in nature, global oscillations are
rarely observed in actual biological systems. This begets the question what is
the missing ingredient that would prevent local oscillations to synchronize
across the population to form global oscillations. Here we show that, although
heterogeneous species-specific invasion rates fail to have a noticeable impact
on species coexistence, randomness in site-specific invasion rates successfully
hinders the emergence of global oscillations and thus preserves biodiversity.
Our model takes into account that the environment is often not uniform but
rather spatially heterogeneous, which may influence the success of microscopic
dynamics locally. This prevents the synchronization of locally emerging
oscillations, and ultimately results in a phenomenon where one type of
randomness is used to mitigate the adverse effects of other types of randomness
in the system.

1611.05918	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Morphology of Fly Larval Class IV Dendrites Accords with a Random
  Branching and Contact Based Branch Deletion Model"	"  Dendrites are branched neuronal processes that receive input signals from
other neurons or the outside world [1]. To maintain connectivity as the
organism grows, dendrites must also continue to grow. For example, the
dendrites in the peripheral nervous system continue to grow and branch to
maintain proper coverage of their receptor fields [2, 3, 4, 5]. One such neuron
is the Drosophila melanogaster class IV dendritic arborization neuron [6]. The
dendritic arbors of these neurons tile the larval surface [7], where they
detect localized noxious stimuli, such as jabs from parasitic wasps [8]. In the
present study, we used a novel measure, the hitting probability, to show that
the class IV neuron forms a tight mesh that covers the larval surface.
Furthermore, we found that the mesh size remains largely unchanged during the
larval stages, despite a dramatic increase in overall size of the neuron and
the larva. We also found that the class IV dendrites are dense (assayed with
the fractal dimension) and uniform (assayed with the lacunarity) throughout the
larval stages. To understand how the class IV neuron maintains its morphology
during larval development, we constructed a mathematical model based on random
branching and self-avoidance. We found that if the branching rate is uniform in
space and time and that if all contacting branches are deleted, we can
reproduce the branch length distribution, mesh size and density of the class IV
dendrites throughout the larval stages. Thus, a simple set of statistical rules
can generate and maintain a complex branching morphology during growth.

1611.06049	q-bio	physics.soc-ph cs.SI q-bio.PE	Quantifying gender preferences across humans lifespan	"  In human relations individuals' gender and age play a key role in the
structures and dynamics of their social arrangements. In order to analyze the
gender preferences of individuals in interaction with others at different
stages of their lives we study a large mobile phone dataset. To do this we
consider four fundamental gender-related caller and callee combinations of
human interactions, namely male to male, male to female, female to male, and
female to female, which together with age, kinship, and different levels of
friendship give rise to a wide scope of human sociality. Here we analyse the
relative strength of these four types of interaction using a large dataset of
mobile phone communication records. Our analysis suggests strong age dependence
for an ego of one gender choosing to call an individual of either gender. We
observe a strong opposite sex bonding across most of their reproductive age.
However, older women show a strong tendency to connect to another female that
is one generation younger in a way that is suggestive of the
\emph{grandmothering effect}. We also find that the relative strength among the
four possible interactions depends on phone call duration. For calls of medium
and long duration, opposite gender interactions are significantly more probable
than same gender interactions during the reproductive years, suggesting
potential emotional exchange between spouses. By measuring the fraction of
calls to other generations we find that mothers tend to make calls more to
their daughters than to their sons, whereas fathers make calls more to their
sons than to their daughters. For younger people, most of their calls go to
same generation alters, while older people call the younger people more
frequently, which supports the suggestion that \emph{affection flows downward}.

  a great potential for novel siderophores and lipopeptides synthesis"	"  Burkholderia is an important genus encompassing a variety of species,
including pathogenic strains as well as strains that promote plant growth. We
have carried out a global strategy, which combined two complementary
approaches. The first one is genome guided with deep analysis of genome
sequences and the second one is assay guided with experiments to support the
predictions obtained in silico. This efficient screening for new secondary
metabolites, performed on 48 gapless genomes of Burkholderia species, revealed
a total of 161 clusters containing nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs),
with the potential to synthesize at least 11 novel products. Most of them are
siderophores or lipopeptides, two classes of products with potential
application in biocontrol. The strategy led to the identification, for the
first time, of the cluster for cepaciachelin biosynthesis in the genome of
Burkholderia ambifaria AMMD and a cluster corresponding to a new
malleobactin-like siderophore, called phymabactin, was identified in
Burkholderia phymatum STM815 genome. In both cases, the siderophore was
produced when the strain was grown in iron-limited conditions. Elsewhere, the
cluster for the antifungal burkholdin was detected in the genome of B.
ambifaria AMMD and also Burkholderia sp. KJ006. Burkholderia pseudomallei
strains harbor the genetic potential to produce a novel lipopeptide called
burkhomycin, containing a peptidyl moiety of 12 monomers. A mixture of
lipopeptides produced by Burkholderia rhizoxinica lowered the surface tension
of the supernatant from 70 to 27 mN/m. The production of nonribosomal secondary
metabolites seems related to the three phylogenetic groups obtained from 16S
rRNA sequences. Moreover, the genome-mining approach gave new insights into the
nonribosomal synthesis exemplified by the identification of dual C/E domains in
lipopeptide NRPSs, up to now essentially found in Pseudomonas strains.

  Autism-based example"	"  Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (R-fMRI) holds the
promise to reveal functional biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. However,
extracting such biomarkers is challenging for complex multi-faceted
neuropatholo-gies, such as autism spectrum disorders. Large multi-site datasets
increase sample sizes to compensate for this complexity, at the cost of
uncontrolled heterogeneity. This heterogeneity raises new challenges, akin to
those face in realistic diagnostic applications. Here, we demonstrate the
feasibility of inter-site classification of neuropsychiatric status, with an
application to the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database, a large
(N=871) multi-site autism dataset. For this purpose, we investigate pipelines
that extract the most predictive biomarkers from the data. These R-fMRI
pipelines build participant-specific connectomes from functionally-defined
brain areas. Connectomes are then compared across participants to learn
patterns of connectivity that differentiate typical controls from individuals
with autism. We predict this neuropsychiatric status for participants from the
same acquisition sites or different, unseen, ones. Good choices of methods for
the various steps of the pipeline lead to 67% prediction accuracy on the full
ABIDE data, which is significantly better than previously reported results. We
perform extensive validation on multiple subsets of the data defined by
different inclusion criteria. These enables detailed analysis of the factors
contributing to successful connectome-based prediction. First, prediction
accuracy improves as we include more subjects, up to the maximum amount of
subjects available. Second, the definition of functional brain areas is of
paramount importance for biomarker discovery: brain areas extracted from large
R-fMRI datasets outperform reference atlases in the classification tasks.

1611.06072	q-bio	q-bio.BM	Variants of intrinsic disorder in the human proteome	"  In this paper we propose a straightforward operational definition of variants
of disordered proteins, taking the human proteome as a case study. The focus is
on a distinction between mostly unstructured proteins and proteins which
contain long unstructured regions accommodated in an overall folded structure.
In particular we distinguish: i) Not disordered proteins (NDPs), that either
have all their residues ordered or do not have disordered segments longer than
30 residues nor more than 30% of disordered residues; ii) Proteins with
intrinsically disordered regions (IDRPs), that have at least one disordered
domain longer than 30 residues, but disordered in less than 30% of their
residues; iii) Proteins that are intrinsically disordered (IDPs), that have
both at least one disordered segment longer than 30 residues and that are
disordered on more than 30% of their residues; iv) Proteins with fragmented
disorder (FRAG_IDPs), that do not have a disordered fragment longer than 30
residues but that, nevertheless, have at least 30% or more of their residues
predicted as disordered. The potential use of these variants is checked over
several groups of disease-related proteins. Our main conclusions point out that
IDRPs are more similar to NDPs than to IDPs. IDRPs and NDPs have a similar
functional repertoire and probably share a lock-and-key mechanism of
interaction with substrates. IDRPs and IDPs are differently present among human
disease-related proteins. IDRPs probably do not play a specific role in the
development of complex diseases, since their frequency is similar in
disease-related proteins and in the entire human proteome. IDPs can play a role
in the emergence of cancer, neurodegenerative, thyroid and liver disease.

against genomic data. Here, we evaluate the extent to which it can be inferred
as the correct model given experimental data. Given genome-wide data from an
evolutionary experiment, we validate the Wright-Fisher model as the better
model for variance in a finite population in contrast to a Gaussian model of
allele frequency propagation. However, we note a range of circumstances under
which the Wright-Fisher model cannot be correctly identified. We discuss the

models used in molecular dynamics are not accurate enough to describe the
conformational ensemble of RNA oligomers and suggest that molecular dynamics
should be complemented with experimental data. We here propose a scheme based
on the maximum entropy principle to combine simulations with bulk experiments.
In the proposed scheme the noise arising from both the measurements and the
forward models used to back calculate the experimental observables is
explicitly taken into account. The method is tested on RNA nucleosides and is
then used to construct chemically consistent corrections to the Amber RNA force
field that allow a large set of experimental data on nucleosides and
dinucleosides to be correctly reproduced. The transferability of these
corrections is assessed against independent data on tetranucleotides and
displays a previously unreported agreement with experiments. This procedure can
be applied to enforce multiple experimental data on multiple systems in a
self-consistent framework thus suggesting a new paradigm for force field
refinement.

macroscopic string down to long-chain molecules. The existence of knotting in a
filament naturally affects its configuration and properties, and may be very
stable or disappear rapidly under manipulation and interaction. Knotting has
been previously identified in protein backbone chains, for which these
mechanical constraints are of fundamental importance to their molecular
functionality, despite their being open curves in which the knots are not
mathematically well defined; knotting can only be identified by closing the
termini of the chain somehow. We introduce a new method for resolving knotting
in open curves using virtual knots, a wider class of topological objects that
do not require a classical closure and so naturally capture the topological
ambiguity inherent in open curves. We describe the results of analysing
proteins in the Protein Data Bank by this new scheme, recovering and extending
previous knotting results, and identifying topological interest in some new
cases. The statistics of virtual knots in protein chains are compared with
those of open random walks and Hamiltonian subchains on cubic lattices,
identifying a regime of open curves in which the virtual knotting description
is likely to be important.

microscopy is the projection of many heterogeneous instances of the object
under study (e.g., a virus). When the object is heterogeneous but has an
overall symmetry, it is natural to describe the object as stochastic with
symmetrical statistics. This paper presents a maximum likelihood reconstruction
approach which allows each object to lack symmetry while constraining the {\it
statistics} of the ensemble of objects to have symmetry. This algorithm is
demonstrated on bacteriophage HK97 and is contrasted with an existing algorithm
in which each object, while still heterogeneous, has the symmetry.
Reconstruction results show that the proposed algorithm eliminates
long-standing distortions in previous heterogeneity calculations associated
with symmetry axes, and provides estimates that make more biologically sense
than the estimates of existing algorithms.

infection that only in the European Union affects about 150,000 patients and
causes extra costs of 380 million Euros annually to the health-care systems.
Increasing efforts have been taken to mitigate the epidemics and to avoid
potential outbreaks in low endemic settings. Understanding the population
dynamics of MRSA through modeling is essential to identify the causal
mechanisms driving the epidemics and to generalize conclusions to different
contexts. We develop an innovative high-resolution spatiotemporal contact
network model of interactions between patients to reproduce the hospital
population in the context of the Stockholm County in Sweden and simulate the
spread of MRSA within this population. Our model captures the spatial and
temporal heterogeneity caused by human behavior and by the dynamics of mobility
within wards and hospitals. We estimate that in this population the epidemic
threshold is at about 0.008. We also identify that these heterogeneous contact
patterns cause the emergence of super-spreader patients and a polynomial growth
of the epidemic curve. We finally study the effect of standard intervention
control strategies and identify that screening is more effective than improved
hygienic in order to cause smaller or null outbreaks.

that images can be described by a relatively sparse number of features. To

value inspired by measurements of natural images. Then, we tested the impact of
this sparseness parameter on the firing pattern observed in a population of
retinal ganglion cells recorded ex vivo in the retina of a rodent, the Octodon
degus. These recordings showed in particular that the reliability of spike
timings varies with respect to the sparseness with globally a similar trend
than the distribution of sparseness statistics observed in natural images.
These results suggest that the code represented in the spike pattern of
ganglion cells may adapt to this aspect of the statistics of natural images.

  water"	"  We introduce an image cytometer (I-CYT) for the analysis of phytoplankton in
fresh and marine water environments. A linear quantification of cell numbers
was observed covering several orders of magnitude using cultures of Tetraselmis
and Nannochloropsis measured by autofluorescence in a laboratory environment.
We assessed the functionality of the system outside the laboratory by
phytoplankton quantification of samples taken from a marine water environment
(Dutch Wadden Sea, The Netherlands) and a fresh water environment (Lake Ijssel,
The Netherlands). The I-CYT was also employed to study the effects of two
ballast water treatment systems (BWTS), based on chlorine electrolysis and UV
sterilization, with the analysis including the vitality of the phytoplankton.
For comparative study and benchmarking of the I-CYT, a standard flow cytometer
was used. Our results prove a limit of detection (LOD) of 10 cells/ml with an
accuracy between 0.7 and 0.5 log, and a correlation of 88.29% in quantification
and 96.21% in vitality, with respect to the flow cytometry results.

1611.06973	q-bio	q-bio.NC cs.CV	RhoanaNet Pipeline: Dense Automatic Neural Annotation	"  Reconstructing a synaptic wiring diagram, or connectome, from electron
microscopy (EM) images of brain tissue currently requires many hours of manual
annotation or proofreading (Kasthuri and Lichtman, 2010; Lichtman and Sanes,
2008; Seung, 2009). The desire to reconstruct ever larger and more complex
networks has pushed the collection of ever larger EM datasets. A cubic
millimeter of raw imaging data would take up 1 PB of storage and present an
annotation project that would be impractical without relying heavily on
automatic segmentation methods. The RhoanaNet image processing pipeline was
developed to automatically segment large volumes of EM data and ease the burden
of manual proofreading and annotation. Based on (Kaynig et al., 2015), we
updated every stage of the software pipeline to provide better throughput
performance and higher quality segmentation results. We used state of the art
deep learning techniques to generate improved membrane probability maps, and
Gala (Nunez-Iglesias et al., 2014) was used to agglomerate 2D segments into 3D
objects.
  We applied the RhoanaNet pipeline to four densely annotated EM datasets, two
from mouse cortex, one from cerebellum and one from mouse lateral geniculate
nucleus (LGN). All training and test data is made available for benchmark
comparisons. The best segmentation results obtained gave
$V^\text{Info}_\text{F-score}$ scores of 0.9054 and 09182 for the cortex
datasets, 0.9438 for LGN, and 0.9150 for Cerebellum.
  The RhoanaNet pipeline is open source software. All source code, training
data, test data, and annotations for all four benchmark datasets are available
at www.rhoana.org.

field in the leaf blade and find it to agree with the experimentally measured

1611.07272	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Derivation of human chromatic discrimination ability from an
  information-theoretical notion of distance in color space"	"  The accuracy with which humans can detect small chromatic differences varies
throughout color space. For example, we are far more precise when
discriminating two similar orange stimuli than two similar green stimuli. In
order for two colors to be perceived as different, the neurons representing
chromatic information must respond differently, and the difference must be
larger than the trial-to-trial variability of the response to each separate
color. Photoreceptors constitute the first stage in the processing of color
information; many more stages are required before humans can consciously report
whether two stimuli are perceived as chromatically distinguishable or not.
Therefore, although photoreceptor absorption curves are expected to influence
the accuracy of conscious discriminability, there is no reason to believe that
they should suffice to explain it. Here we develop information-theoretical
tools based on the Fisher metric that demonstrate that photoreceptor absorption
properties explain ~87% of the variance of human color discrimination ability,
as tested by previous behavioral experiments. In the context of this theory,
the bottleneck in chromatic information processing is determined by
photoreceptor absorption characteristics. Subsequent encoding stages modify
only marginally the chromatic discriminability at the photoreceptor level.

  Expansion and Compression"	"  We develop a neural network model to classify liver cancer patients into
high-risk and low-risk groups using genomic data. Our approach provides a novel
technique to classify big data sets using neural network models. We preprocess
the data before training the neural network models. We first expand the data
using wavelet analysis. We then compress the wavelet coefficients by mapping
them onto a new scaled orthonormal coordinate system. Then the data is used to
train a neural network model that enables us to classify cancer patients into
two different classes of high-risk and low-risk patients. We use the
leave-one-out approach to build a neural network model. This neural network
model enables us to classify a patient using genomic data as a high-risk or
low-risk patient without any information about the survival time of the
patient. The results from genomic data analysis are compared with survival time
analysis. It is shown that the expansion and compression of data using wavelet
analysis and singular value decomposition (SVD) is essential to train the
neural network model.

  reference point method"	"  Managing biodiversity extinction crisis requires wise decision-making
processes able to account for the limited of resources available. In most
decision problems in conservation biology, several conflicting objectives have
to be taken into account. Most methods used in conservation either provide
suboptimal solutions or use strong assumptions about the decision-maker's
preferences. Our paper reviews some of the existing approaches to solve
multi-objective decision problems and presents new multi-objective linear
programming formulations of two multi-objective optimization problems in
conservation, allowing the use of a reference point approach. Reference point
approaches solve multi-objective optimization problems by interactively
representing the preferences of the decision-maker with a point in the criteria
space, called the reference point. We modelled and solved the following two
conservation problems: a dynamic multi-species management problem under
uncertainty and a spatial allocation resource management problem. Results show
that the reference point method outperforms classic methods while illustrating
the use of an interactive methodology for solving combinatorial problems with
multiple objectives. The method is general and can be adapted to a wide range
of ecological combinatorial problems.

long-lasting stimuli. Our method may be applied to other types of multichannel
neuronal data, like EEG, MEG or spiking responses and used for the development
of new read-out algorithms of brain activity and by that opens new perspectives

  few-encounter limit"	"  When does a diffusing particle reach its target for the first time? This
first-passage time (FPT) problem is central to the kinetics of molecular
reactions in chemistry and molecular biology. Here we explain the behavior of
smooth FPT densities, for which all moments are finite, and demonstrate
universal yet generally non-Poissonian long-time asymptotics for a broad
variety of transport processes. While Poisson-like asymptotics arise
generically in the presence of an effective repulsion in the immediate vicinity
of the target, a time-scale separation between direct and reflected indirect
trajectories gives rise to a universal proximity effect: Direct paths, heading
more or less straight from the point of release to the target, become typical
and focused, with a narrow spread of the corresponding first passage times.
Conversely, statistically dominant indirect paths exploring the system size
tend to be massively dissimilar. The initial distance to the target
particularly impacts gene regulatory or competitive stochastic processes, for
which often few binding events determine the regulatory outcome. The proximity
effect is independent of details of the transport, highlighting the robust
character of the FPT features uncovered here.

1611.07831	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Visual motion processing and human tracking behavior	"  The accurate visual tracking of a moving object is a human fundamental skill
that allows to reduce the relative slip and instability of the object's image
on the retina, thus granting a stable, high-quality vision. In order to
optimize tracking performance across time, a quick estimate of the object's
global motion properties needs to be fed to the oculomotor system and
dynamically updated. Concurrently, performance can be greatly improved in terms
of latency and accuracy by taking into account predictive cues, especially
under variable conditions of visibility and in presence of ambiguous retinal
information. Here, we review several recent studies focusing on the integration
of retinal and extra-retinal information for the control of human smooth
pursuit.By dynamically probing the tracking performance with well established
paradigms in the visual perception and oculomotor literature we provide the
basis to test theoretical hypotheses within the framework of dynamic
probabilistic inference. We will in particular present the applications of
these results in light of state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms.

1611.07962	q-bio	q-bio.NC	"Explicitly Linking Regional Activation and Function Connectivity:
  Community Structure of Weighted Networks with Continuous Annotation"	"  A major challenge in neuroimaging is understanding the mapping of
neurophysiological dynamics onto cognitive functions. Traditionally, these maps
have been constructed by examining changes in the activity magnitude of regions
related to task performance. Recently, network neuroscience has produced
methods to map connectivity patterns among many regions to certain cognitive
functions by drawing on tools from network science and graph theory. However,
these two different views are rarely addressed simultaneously, largely because
few tools exist that account for patterns between nodes while simultaneously
considering activation of nodes. We address this gap by solving the problem of
community detection on weighted networks with continuous (non-integer)
annotations by deriving a generative probabilistic model. This model generates
communities whose members connect densely to nodes within their own community,
and whose members share similar annotation values. We demonstrate the utility
of the model in the context of neuroimaging data gathered during a motor
learning paradigm, where edges are task-based functional connectivity and
annotations to each node are beta weights from a general linear model that
encoded a linear decrease in blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal with practice.
Interestingly, we observe that individuals who learn at a faster rate exhibit
the greatest dissimilarity between functional connectivity and activation
magnitudes, suggesting that activation and functional connectivity are distinct
dimensions of neurophysiology that track behavioral change. More generally, the
tool that we develop offers an explicit, mathematically principled link between
functional activation and functional connectivity, and can readily be applied
to a other similar problems in which one set of imaging data offers network
data, and a second offers a regional attribute.

motile microorganisms. Flagellated eukaryotic microalgae in particular, like
the model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, steer either towards or away from
light by a rapid and precisely timed modulation of their flagellar activity.
Cell steering, however, is only the beginning of a much longer process which
ultimately allows cells to determine their light exposure history. This process
is not well understood. Here we present a first quantitative study of the long
timescale phototactic motility of Chlamydomonas at both single cell and
population levels. Our results reveal that the phototactic strategy adopted by
these microorganisms leads to an efficient exposure to light, and that the
phototactic response is modulated over typical timescales of tens of seconds.
The adaptation dynamics for phototaxis and chlorophyll fluorescence show a
striking quantitative agreement, suggesting that photosynthesis controls
quantitatively how cells navigate a light field.

description how the extracellular matrix and intracellular cytoskeleton are
coupled by integrin proteins. The fundamental hypothesis is that differences
between intracellular and extracellular displacements drive
mechanotransduction. A one-dimensional example illustrates the model, which is
then extended to two dimensions. In several cases the equations are solved
analytically, illustrating how displacements divide into two parts: monodomain
displacements are identical in both spaces and therefore do not contribute to
mechanotransduction, whereas bidomain displacements cause mechanotransduction.
A new length constant depends on the intracellular and extracellular shear
moduli and the integrin spring constant, and bidomain effects often occur
within a few length constants of the tissue edge. Numerical methods for solving
the model equations are being developed. Precursors to the model and potential
applications are discussed. The bidomain model may be applicable to cardiac
remodeling, blood vessel regulation, tissue engineering, stem cell
differentiation, cancer biology, and development.

smaller and more localized differences. Pruned networks capitalize on Taylor
dispersion to increase the dispersion capability.

in predicting recovery outcomes of DOC patients. With 30 DOC patients (8
comatose, 8 unresponsive wakefulness syndrome/vegetative state, and 14 minimal
conscious state) and 25 patient controls, we performed group comparison of DTI
parameters across 48 core WM regions of interest (ROIs) using Analysis of
Covariance. Compared with controls, DOC patients had decreased Fractional
anisotropy (FA) and increased diffusivities in widespread WM area.The
corresponding DTI parameters of those WM deficits in DOC patients significantly
correlated with the consciousness level evaluated by Coma Recovery Scale
Revised (CRS-R) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). As for predicting the recovery
outcomes (i.e., regaining consciousness or not, grouped by their Glasgow
Outcome Scale more than 2 or not) at 3 months post scan, radial diffusivity of
left superior cerebellar peduncle and FA of right sagittal stratum reached an
accuracy of 87.5% and 75% respectively. Our findings showed multiple WM
deficits underlying the loss of consciousness level, and demonstrated the
potential value of these WM areas in predicting the recovery outcomes of DOC
patients who have lost awareness of the environment and themselves.

and treatments of neurological disorders and a deeper understanding of the

machine learning models to connectome data in order to predict clinical
outcomes and analyze the importance of subnetworks in the brain. Connectome
data has unique properties, which present both special challenges and
opportunities when used for machine learning. The purpose of this work is to
review the literature on the topic of applying machine learning models to
MRI-based connectome data. This field is growing rapidly and now encompasses a
large body of research. To summarize the research done to date, we provide a
comparative, structured summary of 77 relevant works, tabulated according to
different criteria, that represent the majority of the literature on this
topic. (We also published a living version of this table online at
http://connectomelearning.cs.sfu.ca that the community can continue to
contribute to.) After giving an overview of how connectomes are constructed
from dMRI and fMRI data, we discuss the variety of machine learning tasks that
have been explored with connectome data. We then compare the advantages and
drawbacks of different machine learning approaches that have been employed,
discussing different feature selection and feature extraction schemes, as well
as the learning models and regularization penalties themselves. Throughout this
discussion, we focus particularly on how the methods are adapted to the unique
nature of graphical connectome data. Finally, we conclude by summarizing the
current state of the art and by outlining what we believe are strategic
directions for future research.

particular, they show rather specific behaviors in their homecoming, which are
interesting to observe and to describe analytically. In this paper, we present
a simple mathematical formulation to describe the little penguins parade in
Phillip Island. We observed that penguins have the tendency to waddle back and
forth on the shore to create a sufficiently large group and then walk home
compactly together. The mathematical framework that we introduce describes this
phenomenon, by taking into account ""natural parameters"" such as the eye-sight
of the penguins, their cruising speed and the possible ""fear"" of animals. On
the one hand, this favors the formation of conglomerates of penguins that
gather together, but, on the other hand, this may lead to the ""panic"" of
isolated and exposed individuals. The model that we propose is based on a set
of ordinary differential equations. Due to the discontinuous behavior of the
speed of the penguins, the mathematical treatment (to get existence and
uniqueness of the solution) is based on a ""stop-and-go"" procedure. We use this
setting to provide rigorous examples in which at least some penguins manage to
safely return home (there are also cases in which some penguins freeze due to
panic). To facilitate the intuition of the model, we also present some simple
numerical simulations that can be compared with the actual movement of the
penguins parade.

  Cognitive Flexibility"	"  Cognitive flexibility describes the human ability to switch between modes of
mental function to achieve goals. Mental switching is accompanied by transient
changes in brain activity, which must occur atop an anatomical architecture
that bridges disparate cortical and subcortical regions by underlying white
matter tracts. However, an integrated perspective regarding how white matter
networks might constrain brain dynamics during cognitive processes requiring
flexibility has remained elusive. To address this challenge, we applied
emerging tools from graph signal processing to decompose BOLD signals based on
diffusion imaging tractography in 28 individuals performing a perceptual task
that probed cognitive flexibility. We found that the alignment between
functional signals and the architecture of the underlying white matter network
was associated with greater cognitive flexibility across subjects. Signals with
behaviorally-relevant alignment were concentrated in the basal ganglia and
anterior cingulate cortex, consistent with cortico-striatal mechanisms of
cognitive flexibility. Importantly, these findings are not accessible to
unimodal analyses of functional or anatomical neuroimaging alone. Instead, by
taking a generalizable and concise reduction of multimodal neuroimaging data,
we uncover an integrated structure-function driver of human behavior.

synaptic-coupling type, we consider two types of excitatory and inhibitory
synchronization (i.e., synchronization via synaptic excitation and inhibition)
in complex small-world networks of excitatory regular spiking (RS) pyramidal
neurons and inhibitory fast spiking (FS) interneurons. For both cases of
excitatory and inhibitory synchronization, effects of synaptic couplings on
dynamical responses to external time-periodic stimuli $S(t)$ (applied to a
fraction of neurons) are investigated by varying the driving amplitude $A$ of
$S(t)$. Stimulated neurons are phase-locked to external stimuli for both cases
of excitatory and inhibitory couplings. On the other hand, the stimulation
effect on non-stimulated neurons depends on the type of synaptic coupling. The
external stimulus $S(t)$ makes a constructive effect on excitatory
non-stimulated RS neurons (i.e., it causes external phase lockings in the
non-stimulated sub-population), while $S(t)$ makes a destructive effect on
inhibitory non-stimulated FS interneurons (i.e., it breaks up original
inhibitory synchronization in the non-stimulated sub-population). As results of
these different effects of $S(t)$, the type and degree of dynamical response
(e.g., synchronization enhancement or suppression), characterized by the
dynamical response factor $D_f$ (given by the ratio of synchronization degree
in the presence and absence of stimulus), are found to vary in a distinctly
different way, depending on the synaptic-coupling type. Furthermore, we also
measure the matching degree between the dynamics of the two sub-populations of
stimulated and non-stimulated neurons in terms of a ""cross-correlation"" measure
$M_c$. With increasing $A$, based on $M_c$, we discuss the cross-correlations
between the two sub-populations, affecting the dynamical responses to $S(t)$.

reproduction or heat production by developing energy budget models for
ectothermic and endothermic vertebrates using a mathematical approach. We
calculated energy intake functions of ectotherms and endotherms derived from
their body mass growth. We show that our energy budget model produces energy

endothermic species, like birds and mammals, energy is used for heat production
instead of growth. Our model additionally offers an explanation on known
differences in absolute energy intake between ectothermic fish and reptiles and
endothermic birds and mammals. From a mathematical point of view, the model
comes in two equivalent formulations, a differential and an integral one. It is
derived from a discrete level approach, and it is shown to be well-posed and to
attain a unique solution for (almost) every parameter set. Numerically, the
integral formulation of the model is considered as an inverse problem with
unknown parameters that are estimated using a series of experiments/realistic

exhibits blinking on the time scale of the recording. We compare imaging
results of MUSICAL with SMLM and four contemporary statistical super-resolution
methods for experiments of in-vitro actin filaments and datasets provided by
independent research groups. Results show comparable or superior performance of
MUSICAL. We also demonstrate super-resolution at time scales of 245 ms (using
49 frames at acquisition rate of 200 frames per second) in samples of live-cell
microtubules and live-cell actin filaments.

1611.09089	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Enhanced responsiveness in asynchronous irregular neuronal networks	"  Networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons display asynchronous irregular
(AI) states, where the activities of the two populations are balanced. At the
single cell level, it was shown that neurons subject to balanced and noisy
synaptic inputs can display enhanced responsiveness. We show here that this
enhanced responsiveness is also present at the network level, but only when
single neurons are in a conductance state and fluctuation regime consistent
with experimental measurements. In such states, the entire population of
neurons is globally influenced by the external input. We suggest that this
network-level enhanced responsiveness constitute a low-level form of sensory
awareness.

to study the behavior of different vascular surgical bypass grafts in case of
an arterial occlusive pathology: an obliteration or stenosis of the iliac
artery. We investigate the performances of three different bypass grafts
(Aorto-Femoral, Axillo-Femoral and cross-over Femoral) depending on the degree
of obliteration of the stenosis. Numerical simulations show that all bypass
grafts are efficient since we retrieve in all cases the normal hemodynamics in
the stenosed region while ensuring at the same time a global healthy
circulation. We analyze in particular the Axillo-Femoral bypass graft by
performing hundreds of simulations by varying the values of the Young's modulus
[0.1--50 MPa] and the radius [0.01--5 cm] of the bypass graft. We show that the
Young's modulus and radius of commercial bypass grafts are optimal in terms of
hemodynamic considerations. The numerical findings prove that this approach
could be used to optimize or plan surgeries for specific patients, to perform
parameter's statistics and error propagation evaluations by running extensive
simulations, or to characterize numerically specific bypass grafts.

on knowledge. It is shown that this model, called QKT (quantum knowledge-based
theory), is able to coherently describe some experimental results that are
problematic for the prior quantum-like decision models. In particular, I
consider the experimental results relevant to the post-decision cognitive
dissonance, the problems relevant to the question order effect and response
replicability, and those relevant to the grand-reciprocity equations. A new set
of postulates is proposed, which evidence the different meaning given to the
projectors and to the quantum states. In the final part, I show that the use of
quantum gates can help to better describe and understand the evolution of
quantum-like models.

1611.09245	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Evolving Network Model that Almost Regenerates Epileptic Data	"  In many realistic networks, the edges representing the interactions between
the nodes are time-varying. There is growing evidence that the complex network
that models the dynamics of the human brain has time-varying interconnections,
i.e., the network is evolving. Based on this evidence, we construct a patient
and data specific evolving network model (comprising discrete-time dynamical
systems) in which epileptic seizures or their terminations in the brain are
also determined by the nature of the time-varying interconnections between the
nodes. A novel and unique feature of our methodology is that the evolving
network model remembers the data from which it was conceived from, in the sense
that it evolves to almost regenerate the patient data even upon presenting an
arbitrary initial condition to it. We illustrate a potential utility of our
methodology by constructing an evolving network from clinical data that aids in
identifying an approximate seizure focus -- nodes in such a theoretically
determined seizure focus are outgoing hubs that apparently act as spreaders of
seizures. We also point out the efficacy of removal of such spreaders in
limiting seizures.

provides a general mechanism for diversity in the molecular architectures, and
resulting biological functions, of membrane proteins. We develop a general
physical framework describing the thermodynamic competition between different
oligomeric states of membrane proteins. Using the mechanosensitive channel of
large conductance as a model system, we show how the dominant oligomeric states
of membrane proteins emerge from the interplay of protein concentration in the
cell membrane, protein-induced lipid bilayer deformations, and direct
monomer-monomer interactions. Our results suggest general physical mechanisms
and principles underlying regulation of protein function via control of

1611.09410	q-bio	q-bio.QM	diagno-syst: a tool for accurate inventories in metabarcoding	"  Metabarcoding on amplicons is rapidly expanding as a method to produce
molecular based inventories of microbial communities. Here, we work on
freshwater diatoms, which are microalgae possibly inventoried both on a
morphological and a molecular basis. We have developed an algorithm, in a
program called diagno-syst, based a the notion of informative read, which
carries out supervised clustering of reads by mapping them exactly one by one
on all reads of a well curated and taxonomically annotated reference database.
This program has been run on a HPC (and HTC) infrastructure to address
computation load. We compare optical and molecular based inventories on 10
samples from L\'eman lake, and 30 from Swedish rivers. We track all
possibilities of mismatches between both approaches, and compare the results
with standard pipelines (with heuristics) like Mothur. We find that the
comparison with optics is more accurate when using exact calculations, at the
price of a heavier computation load. It is crucial when studying the long tail
of biodiversity, which may be overestimated by pipelines or algorithms using
heuristics instead (more false positive). This work supports the analysis that
these methods will benefit from progress in, first, building an agreement
between molecular based and morphological based systematics and, second, having
as complete as possible publicly available reference databases.

the most studied problems in population genetics and community ecology.
Stochastic fluctuations lead, inevitably, to the extinction of one of the
species, but the relevant timescale depends on the underlying dynamics. The
persistence time of the community has been calculated for neutral models, where
the only drive of the system is drift (demographic stochasticity) and for
models with strong selection. Following recent analyses that stress the
importance of environmental stochasticity in empirical systems, we present here
a general theory of persistence time of two-species community where drift,
environmental variations and time independent selective advantage are all taken
into account.

for its identification is one of the long standing interests. Using Layers
algorithm, we introduced the concept of anchor residues to identify epitope. We
have shown that majority of the epitope is composed of anchor residues and have
significant bias in epitope for these residues. We optimized the search space
reduction for epitope identification. We used Layers to non-randomly sample the
antigen surface reducing the molecular surface to an average of 75 residues
while preserving 50% of the epitope in the sample surface. To facilitate the
comparison of favorite methods of researchers we compared the popular
techniques used to identify epitope with their sampling performance and
evaluation. We proposed an optimum Sr of 16 {\AA} to sample the antigen
molecules to reduce the search space, in which epitope is identified using
buried surface area method. We used the combinations of molecular surface
sampling, anchor residue intensity in surface, secondary structure and sequence
information to predict epitope at an accuracy of 89%. A web application is made

  in humans and machines"	"  Humans are remarkably adept at interpreting the gaze direction of other
individuals in their surroundings. This skill is at the core of the ability to
engage in joint visual attention, which is essential for establishing social
interactions. How accurate are humans in determining the gaze direction of
others in lifelike scenes, when they can move their heads and eyes freely, and
what are the sources of information for the underlying perceptual processes?
These questions pose a challenge from both empirical and computational
perspectives, due to the complexity of the visual input in real-life
situations. Here we measure empirically human accuracy in perceiving the gaze
direction of others in lifelike scenes, and study computationally the sources
of information and representations underlying this cognitive capacity. We show
that humans perform better in face-to-face conditions compared with recorded
conditions, and that this advantage is not due to the availability of input
dynamics. We further show that humans are still performing well when only the
eyes-region is visible, rather than the whole face. We develop a computational
model, which replicates the pattern of human performance, including the finding
that the eyes-region contains on its own, the required information for
estimating both head orientation and direction of gaze. Consistent with
neurophysiological findings on task-specific face regions in the brain, the
learned computational representations reproduce perceptual effects such as the
Wollaston illusion, when trained to estimate direction of gaze, but not when
trained to recognize objects or faces.

  Statistical Features of the Plant Electrical Response"	"  Plants sense their environment by producing electrical signals which in
essence represent changes in underlying physiological processes. These
electrical signals, when monitored, show both stochastic and deterministic
dynamics. In this paper, we compute 11 statistical features from the raw
non-stationary plant electrical signal time series to classify the stimulus
applied (causing the electrical signal). By using different discriminant
analysis based classification techniques, we successfully establish that there
is enough information in the raw electrical signal to classify the stimuli. In
the process, we also propose two standard features which consistently give good
classification results for three types of stimuli - Sodium Chloride (NaCl),
Sulphuric Acid (H2SO4) and Ozone (O3). This may facilitate reduction in the
complexity involved in computing all the features for online classification of
similar external stimuli in future.

1611.09824	q-bio	q-bio.OT	"Interspecific allometric scaling of unicellular organisms as an
  evolutionary process of food chain creation"	"  Metabolism of living organisms is a foundation of life. The metabolic rate
(energy production per unit time) increases slower than organisms' mass. When
this phenomenon is considered across different species, it is called
interspecific allometric scaling, whose causes are unknown. We argue that the
cause of interspecific allometric scaling is the total effect of physiological
and adaptation mechanisms inherent to organisms composing a food chain.
Together, the workings of these mechanisms are united by a primary goal of any
living creature - its successful reproduction. This primary necessity of each
organism and of the entire food chain is that common denominator, to which all
organisms adjust their metabolic rates. In this article, we consider
unicellular organisms, while the second paper studies multicellular organisms
and the entire concept in more detail. Here, using the proposed concepts and
experimentally verified growth models of five different unicellular organisms,
we obtain close to experimental findings values of allometric exponents of
0.757 for the end of growth and 0.853 for the beginning of growth. These
results comply with experimental observations and prove our theory that the
requirement of successful reproduction within the food chain is an important
factor shaping interspecific allometric scaling.

  Synchronization Measure in EEG Signals"	"  In this paper, we have developed a new measure of understanding the temporal
evolution of phase synchronization for EEG signals using cross-electrode
information. From this measure it is found that there exists a small number of
well-defined phase-synchronized states, each of which is stable for few
milliseconds during the execution of a face perception task. We termed these
quasi-stable states as synchrostates. We used k-means clustering algorithms to
estimate the optimal number of synchrostates from 100 trials of EEG signals
over 128 channels. Our results show that these synchrostates exist consistently
in all the different trials. It is also found that from the onset of the
stimulus, switching between these synchrostates results in well-behaved
temporal sequence with repeatability which may be indicative of the dynamics of
the cognitive process underlying that task. Therefore these synchrostates and
their temporal switching sequences may be used as a new measure of the
stability of phase synchrony and information exchange between different regions
of a human brain.

topography - synchrostates - over the scalp derived from EEG recording for
formulating brain connectivity network in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and
typically-growing children. A synchronization index is adapted for forming the
edges of the connectivity graph capturing the stability of each of the
synchrostates. Such network is formed for 11 ASD and 12 control group children.
Comparative analyses of these networks using graph theoretic measures show that
children with autism have a different modularity of such networks from typical
children. This result could pave the way to a new modality for possible
identification of ASD from non-invasively recorded EEG data.

1611.10003	q-bio	q-bio.NC	Vocabulary and the Brain: Evidence from Neuroimaging Studies	"  In summary of the research findings presented in this paper, various brain
regions are correlated with vocabulary and vocabulary acquisition. Semantic
associations for vocabulary seem to be located near brain areas that vary
according to the type of vocabulary, e.g. ventral temporal regions important
for words for things that can be seen. Semantic processing is believed to be
strongly associated with the ANG. Phonological ability has been closely related
to the anterior surfaces of the SMG. Pathways through the posterior SMG are
thought to link the anterior SMG and the ANG. In vocabulary tasks,
mediotemporal structures may be related to long-term memory processing, with
left hippocampal and parahippocampal regions related to long-term and working
memory, respectively. Precentral structures are associated with phonological
retrieval. Furthermore, many more regions of the brain are of interest in
vocabulary tasks, particularly in areas important for visual and auditory
processing. Furthermore, differences between brain anatomies can be attributed
to vocabulary demands of different languages.

malignancies is highly dependent on enhanced lipogenesis. De novo fatty-acid
synthesis permits accelerated proliferation of tumor cells by providing
structural components to build the membranes. It may also lead to alterations
of physicochemical properties of the formed membranes, which can have an impact
on signaling or even increase resistance to drugs in cancer cells. Cancer
type-specific lipid profiles would allow understanding the actual effects of
lipid changes and therefore could potentially serve as fingerprints for
individual tumors and be explored as diagnostic markers. We have used shotgun
MS approach to identify lipid patterns in different types of acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) patients that either show no karyotype changes or belong to
t(8;21) or inv16 types. The observed differences in lipidomes of t(8;21) and
inv(16) patients, as compared to AML patients without karyotype changes,
concentrate mostly on substantial modulation of ceramides/sphingolipids
synthesis. Also significant changes in the physicochemical properties of the
membranes, between the t(8;21) and the other patients, were noted that were
related to a marked alteration in the saturation levels of lipids. The revealed
differences in lipid profiles of various AML types increase our understanding
of the affected biochemical pathways and can potentially serve as diagnostic
tools.

With the recent progress on collecting massive data and developing advanced

decoding brain wave data into meaningful mind states, with many machine
learning models and algorithms being revisited and developed, especially the
ones that handle time series data because of the nature of brain waves.
However, many of these time series models, like HMM with hidden state in
discrete space or State Space Model with hidden state in continuous space, only
work with one source of data and cannot handle different sources of information
simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an extension of State Space Model to
work with different sources of information together with its learning and
inference algorithms. We apply this model to decode the mind state of students
during lectures based on their brain waves and reach a significant better

Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (synonym: Stegomyia albopicta) has been
described as phytotelmata in the forested areas of Southeast Asia, however,
this has changed in the last four decades as it has adapted to more urban areas
and antrotelmata. Capable of producing eggs with a certain dry resistance as
well as cold hardiness, populations of Ae. albopictus became distributed around
the globe. The invasion of the Ae. albopictus across all over the world is
thought to be the most rapid spread of any insect species in the last four
decades in tropical, subtropical and temperate climate zones. In addition, Ae.
albopictus is a potential vector for at least 27 viruses as well as for several
parasites and plays a major role in the global transmission of dengue virus and
chikungunya virus; and its contribution to the rapid spread of zika virus is
currently under investigation. Therefore, this species is considered a serious
threat to public health worldwide. This work broaches the issue of three
investigations about the potential to adapt and establish stabile populations
of the invasive Asian tiger mosquito Ae. albopictus. As a result of these
investigations, a high potential for this species to become a threat to public
health in many more countries, especially in temperate climatic zones, can be
seen. Due to the fact on the one hand that Ae. albopictus can gain fitness
advantages due to misapplied vector control measures and on the other hand of
the high epigenetically adaptation potential, it is in summary recommended to
focus further research on the development of vaccinations for viruses and other
pathogens. By doing so, citizens will be protected without putting ecosystems
and their services in danger and it is the even more economic solution.

changes among different types of forest and management systems, related with
spatial distributions, using data from a floristic study in the Montes Azules
National Park. Finally, we analyze time series of $CO_{2}$ fluctuations taken
from AMERIFLUX data bases. Our results show firstly that it is possible to
measure the systemic complexity of different forests, characteized by a
criticality state (1/f noise) which has been proposed as a finger print of
complexity. And secondly, that this characteristic can be used as a proxy of
their state of conservation, where the lowest complexity values are found in
perturbed areas showing the relevance of the concept and its measurement for
forest conservation and management.

universally accepted, formal, and yet broadly applicable definition of what an
organism is. Here we introduce a candidate definition. We adopt the view that
the ""organism"" is a functional concept, used by scientists to address
particular questions concerning the future state of a biological system, rather
than something wholly defined by that system. In this approach organisms are a
coarse-graining of a fine-grained dynamical model of a biological system.
Crucially, the coarse-graining of the system into organisms is chosen so that
their dynamics can be used by scientists to make accurate predictions of those
features of the biological system that interests them, and do so with minimal
computational burden. To illustrate our framework we apply it to a dynamic
model of lichen symbiosis---a system where either the lichen or its constituent
fungi and algae could reasonably be considered ""organisms."" We find that the
best choice for what organisms are in this scenario are complex mixtures of
many entities that do not resemble standard notions of organisms. When we
restrict our allowed coarse-grainings to more traditional types of organisms,
we find that ecological conditions, such as niche competition and predation
pressure, play a significant role in determining the best choice for organisms.

cancer, which is a core goal in precision medicine. The scientific community
has focused on improving this prediction based on genomic, epigenomic, and
proteomic datasets measured in human cancer cell lines. Real-world cancer cell

survival. ALS is a neurodegenerative disease with very heterogeneous survival
times. Based on patient data from two national registries, solvers were asked
to predict survival for three different time intervals, which was then
evaluated on undisclosed information from additional data. I describe methods
used to generate new features from existing ones from longitudinal data,
selecting the most predictive features, and developing the best survival model.
I show that easily obtainable engineered features can significantly improve
prediction and could be incorporated into clinical practice. Furthermore, my
prediction model confirms previous reports suggesting that past disease
progression measured by the ALSFRS (ALS functional rating scale score), time
since disease onset, onset site, and age are strong predictors for survival.
Regarding prediction accuracy, this approach ranked second.

forward a novel hypothesis of the relation between computational capacity and
brain size, linking mathematical formalisms of grammars with the allometric
increases in cortical-subcortical ratios that arise in large brains. In sum, i)
thalamocortical loops compute formal grammars; ii) successive cortical regions
describe grammar rewrite rules of increasing size; iii) cortical-subcortical
ratios determine the quantity of stacks in single-stack pushdown grammars; iii)
quantitative increase of stacks yields grammars with qualitatively increased
computational power. We arrive at the specific conjecture that human brain
capacity is equivalent to that of indexed grammars, far short of full
Turing-computable (recursively enumerable) systems. The work provides a
candidate explanatory account of a range of existing human and animal data,
addressing longstanding questions of how repeated similar brain algorithms can
be successfully applied to apparently dissimilar computational tasks (e.g.,
perceptual versus cognitive, phonological versus syntactic); and how
quantitative increases to brains can confer qualitative changes to their

  performance of multiple PdP cycles"	"  Fission yeast G2/M transition is regulated by a biochemical reaction networks
which contains four components: Cdc13, Cdc2, Wee1, and Cdc25. This circuit is
characterized by the ultrasensitive responses of Wee1 or Cdc25 to Cdc13/Cdc2
activity, and the bistability of Cdc2 activation. Previous work has shown that
this bistability is governed by phosphorylation energy. In this article, we
developed the kinetic model of this circuit and conducted further thermodynamic
analysis on the role of phosphorylation energy (&[Delta]G). We showed that
level &[Delta]G shapes the response curves of Wee1 or Cdc25 to Cdc2 and governs
the intrinsic noise level of Cdc2 activity. More importantly, the mutually
antagonistic chemical fluxes around the PdP cycles in G2/M circuit were shown
to act as a stabilizer of Cdc2 activity against &[Delta]G fluctuations. These
results suggests the fundamental role of free energy and chemical fluxes on the
sensitivity, bistability and robustness of G2/M transition.

diffusion phenomena (such as the spread of diseases, emotions, innovations,
failures) or the transport of information (such as news, memes in social
on-line networks). A new analysis of the prevalence, the expected number of
infected nodes in a network, is presented and physically interpreted. The
analysis method is based on spectral decomposition and leads to a universal,
analytic curve, that can bound the time-varying prevalence in any finite time
interval. Moreover, that universal curve also applies to various types of
Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) (and Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR))
infection processes, with both homogenous and heterogeneous infection
characteristics (curing and infection rates), in temporal and even disconnected
graphs and in SIS processes with and without self-infections. The accuracy of
the universal curve is comparable to that of well-established mean-field
approximations.

1612.01409	q-bio	q-bio.QM stat.AP	"Probabilistic Broken-Stick Model: A Regression Algorithm for Irregularly
  Sampled Data with Application to eGFR"	"  In order for clinicians to manage disease progression and make effective
decisions about drug dosage, treatment regimens or scheduling follow up
appointments, it is necessary to be able to identify both short and long-term
trends in repeated biomedical measurements. However, this is complicated by the
fact that these measurements are irregularly sampled and influenced by both
genuine physiological changes and external factors. In their current forms,
existing regression algorithms often do not fulfil all of a clinician's
requirements for identifying short-term events while still being able to
identify long-term trends in disease progression. Therefore, in order to
balance both short term interpretability and long term flexibility, an
extension to broken-stick regression models is proposed in order to make them
more suitable for modelling clinical time series. The proposed probabilistic
broken-stick model can robustly estimate both short-term and long-term trends
simultaneously, while also accommodating the unequal length and irregularly
sampled nature of clinical time series. Moreover, since the model is parametric
and completely generative, its first derivative provides a long-term non-linear
estimate of the annual rate of change in the measurements more reliably than
linear regression. The benefits of the proposed model are illustrated using
estimated glomerular filtration rate as a case study for managing patients with
chronic kidney disease.

Specifically, breast cancer is diagnosed more often than any other type of
cancer. However, breast cancer patients and their individual tumors are often
unique. Identifying the underlying genetic phenotype can lead to precision
(personalized) medicine. Tailoring medical treatment strategies to best fit the
needs of individual patients can dramatically improve their health. Such an
approach requires sufficient knowledge of the patients and the diseases, which
is currently unavailable to practitioners. This study focuses on breast cancer
and proposes a novel two-stage clustering method to partition patients into
hierarchical groups. The first stage is broad grouping, which is based on
phenotypes such as demographic information and clinical features. The second
stage is fine grouping based on genomic characteristics, such as copy number
variation and somatic mutation, of patients in a subgroup resulting from the
first stage. Generally, this framework offers a mechanism to mix multiple forms
of data, both phenotypic and genomic, to most effectively define individual
patients for personalized predictions. This method provides the ability to
detect correlation among all factors.

1612.01561	q-bio	q-bio.PE nlin.CD q-bio.QM	"Mathematical model of plant-virus interactions mediated by RNA
  interference"	"  Cross-protection, which refers to a process whereby artificially inoculating
a plant with a mild strain provides protection against a more aggressive
isolate of the virus, is known to be an effective tool of disease control in
plants. In this paper we derive and analyse a new mathematical model of the
interactions between two competing viruses with particular account for RNA
interference. Our results show that co-infection of the host can either
increase or decrease the potency of individual infections depending on the
levels of cross-protection or cross-enhancement between different viruses.
Analytical and numerical bifurcation analyses are employed to investigate the
stability of all steady states of the model in order to identify parameter
regions where the system exhibits synergistic or antagonistic behaviour between
viral strains, as well as different types of host recovery. We show that not
only viral attributes but also the propagating component of RNA-interference in
plants can play an important role in determining the dynamics.

popular statistically consistent species tree reconstruction algorithms
including ASTRAL-II Neighbor Joining using average gene-tree internode
distances (NJst) and SVD-Quartets+PAUP*, as well as concatenation using maximum
likelihood (RaxML). We find that the faster Neighbor Joining, applied to
concatenated sequences, is among the most effective of these methods for
accurate species tree reconstruction.

1612.01606	q-bio	q-bio.PE	Is nestedness in mutualistic networks an evolutionary spandrel?	"  Mutualistic networks have been shown to involve complex patterns of
interactions among animal and plant species. The architecture of these webs
seems to pervade some of their robust and fragile behaviour. Recent work
indicates that there is a strong correlation between the patterning of
animal-plant interactions and their phylogenetic organisation. Here we show
that such pattern and other reported regularities from mutualistic webs can be
properly explained by means of a very simple model of speciation and
divergence. This model also predicts a co-extinction dynamics under species
loss consistent with the presence of an evolutionary signal. The agreement
between observed and model networks suggests that some patterns displayed by
real mutualistic webs might actually represent evolutionary spandrels.

the global behaviour resembles the one of a self-adaptive system. Each RNA
configuration is a graph and the evolution of configurations is constrained by
precise rules that can be described by a graph grammar.

  modeling and analysis of biomolecular data"	"  Geometric, topological and graph theory modeling and analysis of biomolecules
are of essential importance in the conceptualization of molecular structure,
function, dynamics, and transport. On the one hand, geometric modeling provides
molecular surface and structural representation, and offers the basis for
molecular visualization, which is crucial for the understanding of molecular
structure and interactions. On the other hand, it bridges the gap between
molecular structural data and theoretical/mathematical models. Topological
analysis and modeling give rise to atomic critical points and connectivity, and
shed light on the intrinsic topological invariants such as independent
components (atoms), rings (pockets) and cavities. Graph theory analyzes
biomolecular interactions and reveals biomolecular structure-function
relationship. In this paper, we review certain geometric, topological and graph
theory apparatuses for biomolecular data modeling and analysis. These
apparatuses are categorized into discrete and continuous ones. For discrete
approaches, graph theory, Gaussian network model, anisotropic network model,
normal mode analysis, quasi-harmonic analysis, flexibility and rigidity index,
molecular nonlinear dynamics, spectral graph theory, and persistent homology
are discussed. For continuous mathematical tools, we present discrete to
continuum mapping, high dimensional persistent homology, biomolecular geometric
modeling, differential geometry theory of surfaces, curvature evaluation,
variational derivation of minimal molecular surfaces, atoms in molecule theory
and quantum chemical topology. Four new approaches, including analytical
minimal molecular surface, Hessian matrix eigenvalue map, curvature map and
virtual particle model, are introduced for the first time to bridge the gaps in
biomolecular modeling and analysis.

1612.01910	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Modular knowledge systems accelerate human migration in asymmetric
  random environments"	"  Migration is a key mechanism for expansion of communities. In spatially
heterogeneous environments, rapidly gaining knowledge about the local
environment is key to the evolutionary success of a migrating population. For
historical human migration, environmental heterogeneity was naturally
asymmetric in the north-south (NS) and east-west (EW) directions. We here
consider the human migration process in the Americas, modeled as random,
asymmetric, modularly correlated environments. Knowledge about the environments
determines the fitness of each individual. We present a phase diagram for
asymmetry of migration as a function of carrying capacity and fitness
threshold. We find that the speed of migration is proportional to the inverse
complement of the spatial environmental gradient, and in particular we find
that north-south migration rates are lower than east-west migration rates when
the environmental gradient is higher in the north-south direction.
Communication of knowledge between individuals can help to spread beneficial
knowledge within the population. The speed of migration increases when
communication transmits pieces of knowledge that contribute in a modular way to
the fitness of individuals. The results for the dependence of migration rate on
asymmetry and modularity are consistent with existing archaeological
observations. The results for asymmetry of genetic divergence are consistent
with patterns of human gene flow.

  on: Evolutionary interpretations of mycobacteriophage biodiversity and
  host-range through the analysis of codon usage bias (Esposito et al. 2016)"	"  While confirming the long held view that viruses do not closely imitate the
use of their host's codon catalogue, Esposito and coworkers nevertheless
consider it surprising that, despite having the ability to infect the same
host, many mycobacteriophages share little or no genetic similarity (i.e.
similarity in their GC contents and codon utilization patterns). Arguing
correctly that efficient translation of a phage's proteins within a host is
likely to be optimized by the phage's ability to match the host's codon usage
pattern, it is concluded that the preferred host of many mycobacteriophages is
not Mycobacterium smegmatis, despite their having been isolated on that
organism. Thus, a virus and its elusive preferred hosts would have had similar
GC percentages and codon usages, but the same virus could still infect a
less-preferred host (Mycobacterium smegmatis), where the virus-host similarity
would be less evident. However, there is another evolutionary interpretation.

1612.02116	q-bio	q-bio.MN	Signal Manifestation Trade-offs in Incoherent Feed-Forward Loops	"  Signal processing in biological systems is delicately executed by specialised
networks, which are modular assemblies of network motifs. The motifs are
independently functional circuits found in enormous numbers in any living cell.
A very common network motif is the feed-forward loop (FFL), which regulates a
downstream node by an upstream one in a direct and an indirect way within the
network. If the direct and indirect regulations go antagonistic, the motif is
known as an incoherent FFL (ICFFL). The current study is aimed at exploring the
reason for the variation in the evolutionary selection of the four types of
ICFFLs. As comparative measures, I compute sensitivity amplification,
adaptation precision and efficiency from the temporal dynamics and mutual
information between the input-output nodes of the motifs at steady state. The
ICFFL II performs very efficiently in adaptation but poor in information
processing. On the other hand, ICFFL I and III are better in information
transmission compared to adaptation efficiency. Which is the fittest among them
under the pressure of natural selection? To sort out this puzzle, I take help
from the multi-objective Pareto efficiency. The results, found in the Pareto
task space, are in good agreement with the reported abundance level of all the
types in eukaryotes as well as prokaryotes.

1612.02120	q-bio	q-bio.QM cs.AI q-bio.NC	A Multi-Pass Approach to Large-Scale Connectomics	"  The field of connectomics faces unprecedented ""big data"" challenges. To
reconstruct neuronal connectivity, automated pixel-level segmentation is
required for petabytes of streaming electron microscopy data. Existing
algorithms provide relatively good accuracy but are unacceptably slow, and
would require years to extract connectivity graphs from even a single cubic
millimeter of neural tissue. Here we present a viable real-time solution, a
multi-pass pipeline optimized for shared-memory multicore systems, capable of
processing data at near the terabyte-per-hour pace of multi-beam electron
microscopes. The pipeline makes an initial fast-pass over the data, and then
makes a second slow-pass to iteratively correct errors in the output of the
fast-pass. We demonstrate the accuracy of a sparse slow-pass reconstruction
algorithm and suggest new methods for detecting morphological errors. Our
fast-pass approach provided many algorithmic challenges, including the design
and implementation of novel shallow convolutional neural nets and the
parallelization of watershed and object-merging techniques. We use it to
reconstruct, from image stack to skeletons, the full dataset of Kasthuri et al.
(463 GB capturing 120,000 cubic microns) in a matter of hours on a single
multicore machine rather than the weeks it has taken in the past on much larger
distributed systems.

and electroencephalography (EEG) provide information about neurological
functions in complementary spatiotemporal resolutions; therefore, fusion of
these modalities is expected to provide better understanding of brain activity.
In this paper, we jointly analyze fMRI and multi-channel EEG signals collected
during an auditory oddball task with the goal of capturing brain activity
patterns that differ between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls.
Rather than selecting a single electrode or matricizing the third-order tensor
that can be naturally used to represent multi-channel EEG signals, we preserve
the multi-way structure of EEG data and use a coupled matrix and tensor
factorization (CMTF) model to jointly analyze fMRI and EEG signals. Our
analysis reveals that (i) joint analysis of EEG and fMRI using a CMTF model can
capture meaningful temporal and spatial signatures of patterns that behave
differently in patients and controls, and (ii) these differences and the
interpretability of the associated components increase by including multiple
electrodes from frontal, motor and parietal areas, but not necessarily by
including all electrodes in the analysis.

chronological age in healthy people and deviations from healthy brain ageing
have been associated with cognitive impairment and disease. Here we sought to
further establish the credentials of ""brain-predicted age"" as a biomarker of
individual differences in the brain ageing process, using a predictive
modelling approach based on deep learning, and specifically convolutional
neural networks (CNN), and applied to both pre-processed and raw T1-weighted
MRI data. Firstly, we aimed to demonstrate the accuracy of CNN brain-predicted
age using a large dataset of healthy adults (N = 2001). Next, we sought to
establish the heritability of brain-predicted age using a sample of monozygotic
and dizygotic female twins (N = 62). Thirdly, we examined the test-retest and
multi-centre reliability of brain-predicted age using two samples
(within-scanner N = 20; between-scanner N = 11). CNN brain-predicted ages were
generated and compared to a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) approach, on all
datasets. Input data were grey matter (GM) or white matter (WM) volumetric maps
generated by Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) or raw data. Brain-predicted
age represents an accurate, highly reliable and genetically-valid phenotype,
that has potential to be used as a biomarker of brain ageing. Moreover, age
predictions can be accurately generated on raw T1-MRI data, substantially
reducing computation time for novel data, bringing the process closer to giving
real-time information on brain health in clinical settings.

consider the results within the framework of the ionic Coulomb blockade model
of permeation and selectivity. Voltage clamp recordings were used to
investigate the Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ anomalous mole fraction effect (AMFE)
exhibited by the bacterial sodium channel NaChBac and its mutants.
Site-directed mutagenesis was used to study the effect of either increasing or
decreasing the fixed charge in their selectivity filters for comparison with
the predictions of the Coulomb blockade model. The model was found to describe
well some aspects of the experimental (divalent blockade and AMFE) and
simulated (discrete multi-ion conduction and occupancy band) phenomena,
including a concentration-dependent shift of the Coulomb staircase. These
results substantially extend the understanding of ion channel selectivity and

protein-ligand binding and structural data enables the use of deep machine
learning techniques for protein-ligand scoring.
  We describe convolutional neural network (CNN) scoring functions that take as

scoring function automatically learns the key features of protein-ligand
interactions that correlate with binding. We train and optimize our CNN scoring
functions to discriminate between correct and incorrect binding poses and known
binders and non-binders. We find that our CNN scoring function outperforms the
AutoDock Vina scoring function when ranking poses both for pose prediction and
virtual screening.

are more naturally organized as matrices or higher-order tensor objects where
characteristics are shared across modes. We present a new machine learning
algorithm BaTFLED (Bayesian Tensor Factorization Linked to External Data) that
predicts values in a three-dimensional response tensor using input features for
each of the dimensions. BaTFLED uses a probabilistic Bayesian framework to
learn projection matrices mapping input features for each mode into latent
representations that multiply to form the response tensor. By utilizing a
Tucker decomposition, the model can capture weights for interactions between
latent factors for each mode in a small core tensor. Priors that encourage
sparsity in the projection matrices and core tensor allow for feature selection
and model regularization. This method is shown to far outperform elastic net
and neural net models on 'cold start' tasks from data simulated in a three-mode
structure. Additionally, we apply the model to predict dose-response curves in
a panel of breast cancer cell lines treated with drug compounds that was used

consequence of this lifting is that the total length of the filament projected

behavior of the filaments and ensemble movement. We illustrate, through
simulation, how pattern formation may be achieved through this mechanism.

deep learning has long been regarded as implausible, since it relies in its
basic form on a non-local plasticity rule. To overcome this problem,
energy-based models with local contrastive Hebbian learning were proposed and
tested on a classification task with networks of rate neurons. We extended this

  episodes: Insights using a cellular automaton model"	"  Mathematical models of cardiac electrical excitation are increasingly
complex, with multiscale models seeking to represent and bridge physiological
behaviours across temporal and spatial scales. The increasing complexity of
these models makes it computationally expensive to both evaluate long term (>60
seconds) behaviour and determine sensitivity of model outputs to inputs. This
is particularly relevant in models of atrial fibrillation (AF), where
individual episodes last from seconds to days, and inter-episode waiting times
can be minutes to months. Potential mechanisms of transition between sinus
rhythm and AF have been identified but are not well understood, and it is
difficult to simulate AF for long periods of time using state-of-the-art
models. In this study, we implemented a Moe-type cellular automaton on a novel,
topologically correct surface geometry of the left atrium. We used the model to
simulate stochastic initiation and spontaneous termination of AF, arising from
bursts of spontaneous activation near pulmonary veins. The simplified
representation of atrial electrical activity reduced computational cost, and so
permitted us to investigate AF mechanisms in a probabilistic setting. We
computed large numbers (~10^5) of sample paths of the model, to infer
stochastic initiation and termination rates of AF episodes using different
model parameters. By generating statistical distributions of model outputs, we
demonstrated how to propagate uncertainties of inputs within our microscopic
level model up to a macroscopic level. Lastly, we investigated spontaneous
termination in the model and found a complex dependence on its past AF
trajectory, the mechanism of which merits future investigation.

Considerable efforts have been devoted to the development of methods extracting

map and for the extraction of functional biomarkers from resting state fMRI
scans. In addition, we explain how speed and result quality can be further
improved with random projections. The promising results obtained using the
Human Connectome Project dataset as well as the numerous possi- ble extensions

scabies, are still common in remote communities such as in northern Australia
and the Solomon Islands. Mass drug administration (MDA) has been utilised in
these communities, and although prevalence drops substantially initially, these
reductions have not been sustained. We develop a compartmental model of scabies
infection dynamics and incorporate both ovicidal and non-ovicidal treatment
regimes. By including the dynamics of mass drug administration, we are able to
reproduce the phenomena of an initial reduction in prevalence, followed by the
recrudescence of infection levels in the population. We show that even under a
`perfect' two-round MDA, eradication of scabies under a non-ovicidal treatment
scheme is almost impossible. We then go on to consider how the probability of
elimination varies with the number of treatment rounds delivered in an MDA. We
find that even with infeasibly large numbers of treatment rounds, elimination
remains challenging.

ignoring the much faster selection of symbiotic bacteria. Here we take
host-symbiont interactions into account by introducing a Population
Genetics-like model of holobionts exposed to toxic stress. The stress can be
alleviated by selection of resistant individuals (host and bacteria) and by
secretion of a detoxification agent (""detox""). By defining a new measure,
termed the Lamarckian, we show that selection of resistant bacteria over one
generation of hosts leads to stress-dependent increase in the tolerance of the
host's offspring. This benefit is mediated by co-alleviation of toxic and
physiologic stress. Prolonged exposure leads to further adaptation by 'group
selection' of bacterial communities with higher detox per bacterium. These
findings show that Lamarckian adaptation can arise via interactions between two
levels of Darwinian selection within a holobiont system. The conclusions and
modelling framework are applicable to diverse types of holobiont systems.

  detection"	"  The P300 speller is a well known Brain-Computer Interface paradigm that has
been used for over two decades. A new P300 speller paradigm (XP300) is
proposed. It includes several characteristics: (i) the items are not
intensified by using rows and columns, (ii) the order of the visual stimuli is
pseudo-random, (iii) a visual feedback is added on each item to increase the
stimulus meaning, which is the main novelty. XP300 has been tested on ten
healthy subjects on copy spelling mode, with only eight sensors. It has been
compared with the classical P300 paradigm (CP300). With five repetitions, the
average recognition rate across subjects is 85.25% for XP300 and 77.25% for
CP300. Single-trial detection is significantly higher with XP300 by comparing
the AUC (Area Under Curve) of the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic)
curve. The mean AUC is 0.86 for XP300, 0.80 for CP300. More importantly, XP300
has also been judged as more convenient and user-friendly than CP300, hence
being able to allow longer sessions.

  Parameters for Viral Infection-Induced Cell Apoptosis and Necrosis"	"  We develop a theoretical approach that uses physiochemical kinetics modelling
to describe cell population dynamics upon progression of viral infection in
cell culture, which results in cell apoptosis (programmed cell death) and
necrosis (direct cell death). Several model parameters necessary for computer
simulation were determined by reviewing and analyzing available published
experimental data. By comparing experimental data to computer modelling
results, we identify the parameters that are the most sensitive to the measured
system properties and allow for the best data fitting. Our model allows
extraction of parameters from experimental data and also has predictive power.
Using the model we describe interesting time-dependent quantities that were not
directly measured in the experiment, and identify correlations among the fitted
parameter values. Numerical simulation of viral infection progression is done
by a rate-equation approach resulting in a system of ""stiff"" equations, which
are solved by using a novel variant of the stochastic ensemble modelling
approach. The latter was originally developed for coupled chemical reactions.

  Cartilage"	"  Mounting evidence for the role of oxidative stress in the degeneration of
articular cartilage after an injurious impact requires our modeling &
simulation efforts to temporarily shift from just describing the effect of
mechanical stress and inflammation on osteoarthritis (OA). The hypothesis that
the injurious impact causes irreversible damage to chondrocyte mitochondria,
which in turn increase their production of free radicals, affecting their
energy production and their ability to rebuild the extracellular matrix, has to
be modeled and the processes quantified in order to further the understanding
of OA, its causes, and viable treatment options. The current article presents a
calibrated model that captures the damage oxidative stress incurs on the cell
viability, ATP production, and cartilage stability in a cartilage explant after
a drop-tower impact. The model validates the biological hypothesis and will be
used in further efforts to identify possibilities for treatment and be a part
of a bigger modeling & simulation framework for the development of OA.

of habitat, transforming continuous areas into small ones, usually surrounded
by anthropogenic matrices, has been the focus of many researches within the
scope of conservation. The objective of this study was to develop a computer
model by introducing modifications to the renowned Penna Model for biological
aging, in order to evaluate the behavior of populations subjected to the
effects of fragmented environments. As an object of study, it was used
biological data of the robust tufted capuchin (Sapajus robustus), an endangered
primate species whose geographical distribution within the Atlantic Rain Forest
is part of the backdrop of intense habitat fragmentation. The simulations
showed the expected behavior based on the three main aspects that affects
populations under intense habitat fragmentation: the population density, area
and conformation of the fragments and deleterious effects due the low genetic
variability in small and isolated populations. The model showed itself suitable
to describe changes in viability and population dynamics of the species crested
capuchin considering critical levels of survival in a fragmented environment
and also, actions in order to preserve the species should be focused not only
on increasing available area but also in dispersion dynamics.

1612.04074	q-bio	q-bio.PE stat.AP stat.CO	Spatio-temporal data mining in ecological and veterinary epidemiology	"  Understanding the spread of any disease is a highly complex and
interdisciplinary exercise as biological, social, geographic, economic, and
medical factors may shape the way a disease moves through a population and
options for its eventual control or eradication. Disease spread poses a serious
threat in animal and plant health and has implications for ecosystem
functioning and species extinctions as well as implications in society through
food security and potential disease spread in humans. Space-time epidemiology
is based on the concept that various characteristics of the pathogenic agents
and the environment interact in order to alter the probability of disease
occurrence and form temporal or spatial patterns. Epidemiology aims to identify
these patterns and factors, to assess the relevant uncertainty sources, and to
describe disease in the population. Thus disease spread at the population level
differs from the approach traditionally taken by veterinary practitioners that
are principally concerned with the health status of the individual. Patterns of
disease occurrence provide insights into which factors may be affecting the
health of the population, through investigating which individuals are affected,
where are these individuals located and when did they become infected. With the
rapid development of smart sensors, social networks, as well as digital maps
and remotely-sensed imagery spatio-temporal data are more ubiquitous and richer
than ever before. The availability of such large datasets (Big data) poses
great challenges in data analysis. In addition, increased availability of
computing power facilitates the use of computationally-intensive methods for
the analysis of such data. Thus new methods as well as case studies are needed
to understand veterinary and ecological epidemiology. A special issue aimed to
address this topic.

insertion inside the bilayer is controlled by the vesicle size, osmotic
pressure difference across the membrane and fatty acids concentration in the
external bath. Depending on these parameters, vesicles can grow spherically or
become unstable and fragment into several daughter vesicles. We establish the

decoded neurofeedback method (DecNef) can be explained by Hebbian synaptic
plasticity of connections between V1/V2 and V3/V4 rather than that within
V1/V2, and that reinforcement learning at a cellular level should not be
possible, and thus challenges our conclusions. In this reply, first, we show
that Huang's model is not compatible with our data which strongly suggest
plasticity within V1/V2. Second, the results of our new analysis show that
spontaneous activity is not random but largely accounted for by low-dimensional
components. These and other results indicate that learning to induce a
stimulus-associated template voxel pattern in V1/V2 within as few as 100 trials
is likely to be accomplished by hyper-resolution and sub-voxel level control by
DecNef.

  mapping"	"  Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) is an important method for basic
and translational human neuroscience research. VLSM leverages modern
neuroimaging analysis techniques to build on the classic approach of examining
the relationship between location of brain damage and cognitive deficits.
Testing an association between deficit severity and lesion status in each voxel
involves very many individual tests and requires statistical correction for
multiple comparisons. Several strategies have been adapted from analysis of
functional neuroimaging data, though VLSM faces a more difficult trade-off
between avoiding false positives and statistical power (missing true effects).
Non-parametric, permutation-based methods are generally preferable because they
do not make assumptions that are likely to be violated by skewed distributions
of behavioral deficit (symptom) scores and by the necessary spatial contiguity
of stroke lesions. We used simulated and real deficit scores from a sample of
approximately 100 individuals with left hemisphere stroke to evaluate two such
permutation-based approaches. Using permutation to set a minimum cluster size
identified a region that systematically extended well beyond the true region,
even under the most conservative settings tested here, making it ill-suited to
identifying brain-behavior relationships. In contrast, generalizing the
standard permutation-based family-wise error correction approach provided a
principled way to balance false positives and false negatives. An
implementation of this continuous permutation-based FWER correction method is
available at https://gist.github.com/dmirman/05a92e0e9e0027f6fe6e528c648143d7

  traumatic brain injuries with deep convolutional neural networks"	"  The accurate diagnosis and assessment of neurodegenerative disease and
traumatic brain injuries (TBI) remain open challenges. Both cause cognitive and
functional deficits due to focal axonal swellings (FAS), but it is difficult to
deliver a prognosis due to our limited ability to assess damaged neurons at a
cellular level in vivo. We simulate the effects of neurodegenerative disease
and TBI using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as our model of cognition.
We utilize biophysically relevant statistical data on FAS to damage the
connections in CNNs in a functionally relevant way. We incorporate energy
constraints on the brain by pruning the CNNs to be less over-engineered.
Qualitatively, we demonstrate that damage leads to human-like mistakes. Our
experiments also provide quantitative assessments of how accuracy is affected
by various types and levels of damage. The deficit resulting from a fixed
amount of damage greatly depends on which connections are randomly injured,
providing intuition for why it is difficult to predict impairments. There is a
large degree of subjectivity when it comes to interpreting cognitive deficits
from complex systems such as the human brain. However, we provide important
insight and a quantitative framework for disorders in which FAS are implicated.

  adults with mental illness"	"  Physical activity is disrupted in many psychiatric disorders. Advances in
everyday technologies (e.g. accelerometers in smart phones) opens exciting
possibilities for non-intrusive acquisition of activity data. Successful
exploitation of this opportunity requires the validation of analytical methods
that can capture the full movement spectrum. The study aim was to demonstrate
an analytical approach to characterise accelerometer-derived activity patterns.
Here, we use statistical methods to characterise accelerometer-derived activity
patterns from a heterogeneous sample of 99 community-based adults with mental
illnesses. Diagnoses were screened using the Mini international
Neuropsychiatric Interview, and participants wore accelerometers for one week.
We studies the relative ability of simple (exponential), complex
(heavy-tailed), and composite models to explain patterns of activity and
inactivity. Activity during wakefulness was a composite of brief random
(exponential) movements and complex (heavy-tailed) processes, whereas movement
during sleep lacked the heavy-tailed component. In contrast, inactivity
followed a heavy-tailed process, lacking the random component. Activity
patterns differed in nature between those with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder
and a primary psychotic disorder. These results show the potential of complex
models to quntify the rich nature of human movement captured by accelerometry
during wake and sleep, and the interaction with diagnosis and health.

1612.04682	q-bio	q-bio.OT	The design of a proto-animal brain based upon spike timing	"  A basal animal model is described as an organism similar to a Limpet that is
attached to the sea floor living in a reproductive community. Its brain model
uses logic cells (gates) to create a high frequency spike generator. Addition
logic cells create a timing framework based upon Pulse Width Modulation (PWM),
and create multi-cell, spike driven muscle actuators and bi-directional shift
registers that serve as memories. Together, these logic cells generate a pulse
train that forms a recurrent fractal in the form of coherent square waves that
consist of an equal number of set pulses and reset pulses. These pulses drive
the actuators that pump water and food through its shell. Some of these
individuals lose their permanent attachment to the sea floor, and evolve the
ability to move around using the feeding motions. This creates the hazard of
getting stuck against an object or moving away from its breeding community.
They evolve a sensor system and logic cells that produce a restoring motion for
each avoidance motion. This keeps the animal in the specific region of an
object that it encounters (hefting), and maintains the zero sum (coherence) of
the fractal, and connects the organism cyberneticly to objects that are sensed
in its environment. The logic units evolve to store permanent memories, and add
plus and minus pulse trains together into a single pulse train that allow the
animal to follow a moving object (imprinting). Additional logic units evolve
that allow the animal to heft using contacts with multiple objects that allow
the animal to return to its point of origin (reproductive migration) using
permanent memories that are created when a pulse is not reset to zero.So,
information is stored in multiple logic cells instead of a connection to one
logic cell, and is based upon spike timing rather than static (synaptic)
connections between cells.

pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, influence
the migration of a population of cells during wound healing. Fisher's Equation
has been used extensively to model experimental wound healing assays due to its
simple nature and known traveling wave solutions. This partial differential
equation with independent variables of time and space cannot account for the
effects of biochemical activity on wound healing, however. To this end, we
derive a structured Fisher's Equation with independent variables of time,
space, and biochemical pathway activity level and prove the existence of a
self-similar traveling wave solution to this equation. We also consider a more
complicated model with different phenotypes based on MAPK activation and
numerically investigate how various temporal patterns of biochemical activity
can lead to increased and decreased rates of population migration.

  occlusion"	"  The primate visual system has an exquisite ability to discriminate partially
occluded shapes. Recent electrophysiological recordings suggest that response
dynamics in intermediate visual cortical area V4, shaped by feedback from
prefrontal cortex (PFC), may play a key role. To probe the algorithms that may
underlie these findings, we build and test a model of V4 and PFC interactions
based on a hierarchical predictive coding framework. We propose that
probabilistic inference occurs in two steps. Initially, V4 responses are driven
solely by bottom-up sensory input and are thus strongly influenced by the level
of occlusion. After a delay, V4 responses combine both feedforward input and
feedback signals from the PFC; the latter reflect predictions made by PFC about
the visual stimulus underlying V4 activity. We find that this model captures
key features of V4 and PFC dynamics observed in experiments. Specifically, PFC
responses are strongest for occluded stimuli and delayed responses in V4 are
less sensitive to occlusion, supporting our hypothesis that the feedback
signals from PFC underlie robust discrimination of occluded shapes. Thus, our
study proposes that area V4 and PFC participate in hierarchical inference, with
feedback signals encoding top-down predictions about occluded shapes.

absorbing states, and the environment follows a Markovian process, resulting in
a fluctuating payoff matrix for the evolutionary game. Our focus is on the
fixation or extinction of a single mutant in a population of wildtypes. We show
that the nonlinear nature of fitnesses in multi-player games gives rise to an
intricate interplay of selection, genetic drift and environmental fluctuations.
This generates effects not seen in simpler two-player games. To analyse
trajectories towards fixation we analytically calculate sojourn times for
general birth-death processes in populations of two types of individuals and in
fluctuating environments.

  kinetic partitioning? An overview from MD simulation studies"	"  Background: Guanine quadruplexes (GQs) play vital roles in many cellular
processes and are of much interest as drug targets. In contrast to the
availability of many structural studies, there is still limited knowledge on GQ
folding.
  Scope of review: We review recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies
of the folding of GQs, with an emphasis paid to the human telomeric DNA GQ. We
explain the basic principles and limitations of all types of MD methods used to
study unfolding and folding in a way accessible to non-specialists. We discuss
the potential role of G-hairpin, G-triplex and alternative GQ intermediates in
the folding process. We argue that, in general, folding of GQs is fundamentally
different from funneled folding of small fast-folding proteins, and can be best
described by a kinetic partitioning (KP) mechanism. KP is a competition between
at least two (but often many) well-separated and structurally different
conformational ensembles.
  Major conclusions: The KP mechanism is the only plausible way to explain
experiments reporting long time-scales of GQ folding and the existence of
long-lived sub-states. A significant part of the natural partitioning of the
free energy landscape of GQs comes from the ability of the GQ-forming sequences
to populate a large number of syn-anti patterns in their G-tracts. The extreme
complexity of the KP of GQs typically prevents an appropriate description of
the folding landscape using just a few order parameters or collective
variables.
  General significance: We reconcile available computational and experimental
studies of GQ folding and formulate basic principles characterizing GQ folding
landscapes

1612.05955	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Resolving the paradox of evolvability with learning theory: How
  evolution learns to improve evolvability on rugged fitness landscapes"	"  It has been hypothesized that one of the main reasons evolution has been able
to produce such impressive adaptations is because it has improved its own
ability to evolve -- ""the evolution of evolvability"". Rupert Riedl, for
example, an early pioneer of evolutionary developmental biology, suggested that
the evolution of complex adaptations is facilitated by a developmental
organization that is itself shaped by past selection to facilitate evolutionary
innovation. However, selection for characteristics that enable future
innovation seems paradoxical: natural selection cannot favor structures for
benefits they have not yet produced, and favoring characteristics for benefits
that have already been produced does not constitute future innovation. Here we
resolve this paradox by exploiting a formal equivalence between the evolution
of evolvability and learning systems. We use the conditions that enable simple
learning systems to generalize, i.e., to use past experience to improve
performance on previously unseen, future test cases, to demonstrate conditions
where natural selection can systematically favor developmental organizations
that benefit future evolvability. Using numerical simulations of evolution on
highly epistatic fitness landscapes, we illustrate how the structure of evolved
gene regulation networks can result in increased evolvability capable of
avoiding local fitness peaks and discovering higher fitness phenotypes. Our
findings support Riedl's intuition: Developmental organizations that ""mimic""
the organization of constraints on phenotypes can be favored by short-term
selection and also facilitate future innovation. Importantly, the conditions
that enable the evolution of such surprising evolvability follow from the same
non-mysterious conditions that permit generalization in learning systems.

swarming E. coli bacteria on the surface of a moderately soft agar plate.
Individual bacteria are modelled by self-propelled ridged bodies (agents),
which interact with each other only through inelastic collision and with the
highly viscous environment through damping forces. The motion of single agents
is modelled closely corresponding to the behaviour of swimming bacteria. The
dynamics of the model were adjusted to reproduce the experimental measurements
of swimming E. coli K 12. Accordingly, simulations with loosely packed agents
(p=0) show typical run-and-tumble statistics. In contrast, simulations with
densely packed agents (p=0.3-0.7) are dominated by interactions (collisions)
between agents which lead to the emergence of swarming behaviour. In addition,
we model the motion of single agents on the base of modified run-and-tumble
dynamics, where the bacteria do not turn actively during the tumble. We show
that simulations with densely packed modified agents lead as well the emergence
of swarming behaviour, if rotational diffusion is considered.

central to learning and memory. The effects of glycosylation on the structure
and dynamics of NMDARs are largely unknown. In this work, we use extensive
molecular dynamics simulations of GluN1 and GluN2B ligand binding domains
(LBDs) of NMDARs to investigate these effects. Our simulations predict that
intra-domain interactions involving the glycan attached to residue GluN1-N440
stabilize closed-clamshell conformations of the GluN1 LBD. The glycan on
GluN2B-N688 shows a similar, though weaker, effect. Based on these results, and
assuming the transferability of the results of LBD simulations to the full
receptor, we predict that glycans at GluN1-N440 might play a potentiator role
in NMDARs. To validate this prediction, we perform electrophysiological
analysis of full-length NMDARs with a glycosylation-preventing GluN1-N440Q
mutation, and demonstrate an increase in the glycine EC50 value. Overall, our
results suggest an intramolecular potentiating role of glycans on NMDA

enabled by an interconnected musculoskeletal network controlled by the nervous

understanding of this network and its control by neural systems has remained
elusive. Here we utilize medical databases and mathematical modeling to reveal
the organizational structure, predicted function, and neural control of the

which single muscles connect to multiple bones via both origin and insertion
points. We demonstrate that a muscle's role in this network predicts
susceptibility of surrounding components to secondary injury. Finally, we
illustrate that sets of muscles cluster into network communities that mimic the
organization of motor cortex control modules. This novel formalism for

foundation to develop and test therapeutic responses to injury, inspiring
future advances in clinical treatments.

These feedbacks can play an important role in determining whether populations

framework for studying these effects, we develop a theorem for coexistence for
ecological models accounting for internal and external feedbacks. Specifically,
we use average Lyapunov functions and Morse decompositions to develop
sufficient and necessary conditions for robust permanence, a form of
coexistence robust to large perturbations of the population densities and small
structural perturbations of the models. We illustrate how our results can be
applied to verify permanence in non-autonomous models, structured population
models, including those with frequency-dependent feedbacks, and models of
eco-evolutionary dynamics. In these applications, we discuss how our results

  Perturbation Experiments"	"  Reconstructing the causal network in a complex dynamical system plays a
crucial role in many applications, from sub-cellular biology to economic
systems. Here we focus on inferring gene regulation networks (GRNs) from
perturbation or gene deletion experiments. Despite their scientific merit, such
perturbation experiments are not often used for such inference due to their
costly experimental procedure, requiring significant resources to complete the
measurement of every single experiment. To overcome this challenge, we develop
the Robust IDentification of Sparse networks (RIDS) method that reconstructs
the GRN from a small number of perturbation experiments. Our method uses the
gene expression data observed in each experiment and translates that into a
steady state condition of the system's nonlinear interaction dynamics. Applying
a sparse optimization criterion, we are able to extract the parameters of the
underlying weighted network, even from very few experiments. In fact, we
demonstrate analytically that, under certain conditions, the GRN can be
perfectly reconstructed using $K = \Omega (d_{max})$ perturbation experiments,
where $d_{max}$ is the maximum in-degree of the GRN, a small value for
realistic sparse networks, indicating that RIDS can achieve high performance
with a scalable number of experiments. We test our method on both synthetic and
experimental data extracted from the DREAM5 network inference challenge. We
show that the RIDS achieves superior performance compared to the
state-of-the-art methods, while requiring as few as ~60% less experimental
data. Moreover, as opposed to almost all competing methods, RIDS allows us to
infer the directionality of the GRN links, allowing us to infer empirical GRNs,
without relying on the commonly provided list of transcription factors.

become available for research. This data offers great chances for machine
learning applications in health care, e.g. for precision medicine, but is also
challenging to analyze. Typical challenges include a large number of possibly
correlated features and heterogeneity in the data. One flourishing field of
biological research in which this is relevant is epigenetics. Here, especially
large amounts of DNA methylation data have emerged. This epigenetic mark has
been used to predict a donor's 'epigenetic age' and increased epigenetic aging
has been linked to lifestyle and disease history. In this paper we propose an
adaptive model which performs feature selection for each test sample
individually based on the distribution of the input data. The method can be
seen as partially blind domain adaptation. We apply the model to the problem of
age prediction based on DNA methylation data from a variety of tissues, and
compare it to a standard model, which does not take heterogeneity into account.
The standard approach has particularly bad performance on one tissue type on
which we show substantial improvement with our new adaptive approach even
though no samples of that tissue were part of the training data.

playing a false note (p<0.01, d=0.6). Finally, the real-time capabilities of
wireless EEG monitoring were explored with a data visualisation during live

  neglected concept in the complexity-stability debate"	"  The consensus that complexity begets stability in ecosystems was challenged
in the seventies, a result recently extended to ecologically-inspired networks.
The approaches assume the existence of a feasible equilibrium, i.e. with
positive abundances. However, this key assumption has not been tested. We
provide analytical results complemented by simulations which show that
equilibrium feasibility vanishes in species rich systems. This result leaves us
in the uncomfortable situation in which the existence of a feasible equilibrium
assumed in local stability criteria is far from granted. We extend our analyses
by changing interaction structure and intensity, and find that feasibility and
stability is warranted irrespective of species richness with weak interactions.
Interestingly, we find that the dynamical behaviour of ecologically inspired
architectures is very different and richer than that of unstructured systems.
Our results suggest that a general understanding of ecosystem dynamics requires
focusing on the interplay between interaction strength and network
architecture.

1612.06881	q-bio	nlin.AO q-bio.NC	Independent Noise Synchronizing Networks of Oscillator Networks	"  Oscillators coupled in a network can synchronize with each other to yield a
coherent population rhythm. If multiple such networks are coupled together, the
question arises whether these rhythms will synchronize. We investigate the
impact of noise on this synchronization for strong inhibitory pulse-coupling
and find that increasing the noise can synchronize the population rhythms, even
if the noisy inputs to different oscillators are completely uncorrelated.
Reducing the system to a phenomenological iterated map we show that this
synchronization of the rhythms arises from the noise-induced phase
heterogeneity of the oscillators. The synchronization of population rhythms is
expected to be particularly relevant for brain rhythms.

  of locomotion"	"  Cells in tissues can organize into a broad spectrum of structures according
to their function. Drastic changes of organization, such as
epithelial-mesenchymal transitions or the formation of spheroidal aggregates,
are often associated either to tissue morphogenesis or to cancer progression.
Here, we study the organization of cell colonies by means of simulations of
self-propelled particles with generic cell-like interactions. The interplay
between cell softness, cell-cell adhesion, and contact inhibition of locomotion
(CIL) yields structures and collective dynamics observed in several existing
tissue phenotypes. These include regular distributions of cells, dynamic cell
clusters, gel-like networks, collectively migrating monolayers, and 3D
aggregates. We give analytical predictions for transitions between noncohesive,
cohesive, and 3D cell arrangements. We explicitly show how CIL yields an
effective repulsion that promotes cell dispersal, thereby hindering the
formation of cohesive tissues. Yet, in continuous monolayers, CIL leads to
collective cell motion, ensures tensile intercellular stresses, and opposes
cell extrusion. Thus, our work highlights the prominent role of CIL in
determining the emergent structures and dynamics of cell colonies.

1612.06921	q-bio	q-bio.QM	"A Hidden Markov Movement Model for rapidly identifying behavioral states
  from animal tracks"	"  1. Electronic telemetry is frequently used to document animal movement
through time. Methods that can identify underlying behaviors driving specific
movement patterns can help us understand how and why animals use available
space, thereby aiding conservation and management efforts. For aquatic animal
tracking data with significant measurement error, a Bayesian state-space model
called the first-Difference Correlated Random Walk with Switching (DCRWS) has
often been used for this purpose. However, for aquatic animals, highly accurate
tracking data of animal movement are now becoming more common.
  2. We developed a new Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for identifying behavioral
states from animal tracks with negligible error, which we called the Hidden
Markov Movement Model (HMMM). We implemented as the basis for the HMMM the
process equation of the DCRWS, but we used the method of maximum likelihood and
the R package TMB for rapid model fitting.
  3. We compared the HMMM to a modified version of the DCRWS for highly
accurate tracks, the DCRWSnome, and to a common HMM for animal tracks fitted
with the R package moveHMM. We show that the HMMM is both accurate and suitable
for multiple species by fitting it to real tracks from a grey seal, lake trout,
and blue shark, as well as to simulated data.
  4. The HMMM is a fast and reliable tool for making meaningful inference from
animal movement data that is ideally suited for ecologists who want to use the
popular DCRWS implementation for highly accurate tracking data. It additionally
provides a groundwork for development of more complex modelling of animal
movement with TMB. To facilitate its uptake, we make it available through the R
package swim.

  inferotemporal visual cortex and convolutional networks"	"  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained for object classification
have a number of striking similarities with the primate ventral visual stream.
In particular, activity in early, intermediate, and late layers is closely
related to activity in V1, V4, and the inferotemporal cortex (IT). This study
further compares activity in late layers of object-classification CNNs to
activity patterns reported in the IT electrophysiology literature. There are a
number of close similarities, including the distributions of population
response sparseness across stimuli, and the distribution of size tuning
bandwidth. Statisics of scale invariance, responses to clutter and occlusion,
and orientation tuning are less similar. Statistics of object selectivity are
quite different. These results agree with recent studies that highlight strong
parallels between object-categorization CNNs and the ventral stream, and also
highlight differences that could perhaps be reduced in future CNNs.

sum of their parts? Can the dynamical complexity of such networks be globally
quantified in an information-theoretic way and be meaningfully coupled to brain
function? Recently, measures of dynamical complexity such as integrated
information have been proposed. However, problems related to the normalization
and Bell number of partitions associated to these measures make these
approaches computationally infeasible for large-scale brain networks. Our goal
in this work is to address this problem. Our formulation of network integrated
information is based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the
multivariate distribution on the set of network states versus the corresponding
factorized distribution over its parts. We find that implementing the maximum
information partition optimizes computations. These methods are well-suited for
large networks with linear stochastic dynamics. We compute the integrated
information for both, the system's attractor states, as well as non-stationary
dynamical states of the network. We then apply this formalism to brain networks
to compute the integrated information for the human brain's connectome.
Compared to a randomly re-wired network, we find that the specific topology of
the brain generates greater information complexity.

cross-linked actin filaments and myosin motors, representing the cortical
cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells. We implement coarse-grained representations
of force production by myosin motors and stress dissipation through an
effective cross-link friction and filament turnover. We use this model to
characterize how the sustained production of active stress, and the steady
dissipation of elastic stress, depend individually on motor activity, effective
cross-link friction and filament turnover. Then we combine these results to
gain insights into how microscopic network parameters control steady state flow
produced by asymmetric distributions of motor activity. Our results provide a
framework for understanding how local modulation of microscopic interactions
within contractile networks control macroscopic quantities like active stress
and effective viscosity to control cortical deformation and flow at cellular
scales.

1612.07772	q-bio	q-bio.QM q-bio.NC	"Functional Hypergraph Uncovers Novel Covariant Structures over
  Neurodevelopment"	"  Brain development during adolescence is marked by substantial changes in
brain structure and function, leading to a stable network topology in
adulthood. However, most prior work has examined the data through the lens of
brain areas connected to one another in large-scale functional networks. Here,
we apply a recently-developed hypergraph approach that treats network
connections (edges) rather than brain regions as the unit of interest, allowing
us to describe functional network topology from a fundamentally different
perspective. Capitalizing on a sample of 780 youth imaged as part of the
Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, this hypergraph representation of
resting-state functional MRI data reveals three distinct classes of
sub-networks (hyperedges): clusters, bridges, and stars, which represent
spatially distributed, bipartite, and focal architectures, respectively.
Cluster hyperedges show a strong resemblance to the functional modules of the
brain including somatomotor, visual, default mode, and salience systems. In
contrast, star hyperedges represent highly localized subnetworks centered on a
small set of regions, and are distributed across the entire cortex. Finally,
bridge hyperedges link clusters and stars in a core-periphery organization.
Notably, developmental changes within hyperedges are ordered in a similar
core-periphery fashion, with the greatest developmental effects occurring in
networked hyperedges within the functional core. Taken together, these results
emphasize that the network organization of human brain emerges across multiple
scales and evolves substantially through the adolescent period.

require natural selection emerged in Victorian times (Fleeming Jenkin, George
Romanes, William Bateson). In the 1980s paleontologist Steven Jay Gould gave a
theoretical underpinning of this non-genic ""chromosomal"" view, thus reinstating
Richard Goldschmidt's ""heresy"" of the 1930s. From modelling studies with
computer-generated ""biomorphs,"" zoologist Richard Dawkins also affirmed
Goldschmidt, proclaiming the ""evolution of evolvability."" However, in the
1990s, while Gould and Dawkins were recanting, bioinformatic, biochemical and
cytological studies were providing a deeper underpinning. In 2001 this came
under attack from leaders in the field who favored Dawkins' genic emphasis.
Now, with growing evidence from multiple sources, we can reinstate again
Goldschmidt's view and clarify its nineteenth century roots.

1612.07897	q-bio	q-bio.CB	Criticality in Cell Differentiation	"  Cell differentiation is an important process in living organisms.
Differentiation is mostly based on binary decisions with the progenitor cells
choosing between two specific lineages. The differentiation dynamics have both
deterministic and stochastic components. Several theoretical studies suggest
that cell differentiation is a bifurcation phenomenon, well-known in dynamical
systems theory. The bifurcation point has the character of a critical point
with the system dynamics exhibiting specific features in its vicinity. These
include the critical slowing down, rising variance and lag-1 autocorrelation
function, strong correlations between the fluctuations of key variables and
non-Gaussianity in the distribution of fluctuations. Recent experimental
studies provide considerable support to the idea of criticality in cell
differentiation and in other biological processes like the development of the
fruit fly embryo. In this Review, an elementary introduction is given to the
concept of criticality in cell differentiation. The correspondence between the
signatures of criticality and experimental observations on blood cell
differentiation in mice is further highlighted.

1612.08058	q-bio	q-bio.QM cond-mat.soft physics.bio-ph	"Embedding of biological distribution networks with differing
  environmental constraints"	"  Distribution networks -- from vasculature to urban transportation systems --
are prevalent in both the natural and consumer worlds. These systems are
intrinsically physical in composition and are embedded into real space,
properties that lead to constraints on their topological organization. In this
study, we compare and contrast two types of biological distribution networks:
mycelial fungi and the vasculature system on the surface of rodent brains. Both
systems are alike in that they must route resources efficiently, but they are
also inherently distinct in terms of their growth mechanisms, and in that fungi
are not attached to a larger organism and must often function in unregulated
and varied environments. We begin by uncovering a common organizational
principle -- Rentian scaling -- that manifests as hierarchical network layout
in both physical and topological space. Simulated models of distribution
networks optimized for transport in the presence of fluctuations are also shown
to exhibit this feature in their embedding, with similar scaling exponents.
However, we also find clear differences in how the fungi and vasculature
balance tradeoffs in material cost, efficiency, and robustness. While the
vasculature appear well optimized for low cost, but relatively high efficiency,
the fungi tend to form more expensive but in turn more robust networks. These
differences may be driven by the distinct functions that each system must
perform, and the different habitats in which they reside. As a whole, this work
demonstrates that distribution networks contain a set of common, emergent
design features, as well as tailored optimizations.

interactions form intricate patterns over large spatiotemporal scales, and
produce emergent behaviors that are difficult to predict from individual
elements. Network science provides a particularly appropriate framework in
which to study and intervene in such systems, by treating neural elements
(cells, volumes) as nodes in a graph and neural interactions (synapses, white
matter tracts) as edges in that graph. Here, we review the emerging discipline
of network neuroscience, which uses and develops tools from graph theory to
better understand and manipulate neural systems, from micro- to macroscales. We
present examples of how human brain imaging data is being modeled with network
analysis and underscore potential pitfalls. We then highlight current
computational and theoretical frontiers, and emphasize their utility in
informing diagnosis and monitoring, brain-machine interfaces, and brain
stimulation. A flexible and rapidly evolving enterprise, network neuroscience

1612.08084	q-bio	q-bio.MN physics.bio-ph	Optimal decoding of information from a genetic network	"  Gene expression levels carry information about signals that have functional
significance for the organism. Using the gap gene network in the fruit fly
embryo as an example, we show how this information can be decoded, building a
dictionary that translates expression levels into a map of implied positions.
The optimal decoder makes use of graded variations in absolute expression
level, resulting in positional estimates that are precise to ~1% of the
embryo's length. We test this optimal decoder by analyzing gap gene expression
in embryos lacking some of the primary maternal inputs to the network. The
resulting maps are distorted, and these distortions predict, with no free
parameters, the positions of expression stripes for the pair-rule genes in the
mutant embryos.

1612.08311	q-bio	q-bio.BM	"Multiscale persistent functions for biomolecular structure
  characterization"	"  In this paper, we introduce multiscale persistent functions for biomolecular
structure characterization. The essential idea is to combine our multiscale
rigidity functions with persistent homology analysis, so as to construct a
series of multiscale persistent functions, particularly multiscale persistent
entropies, for structure characterization. To clarify the fundamental idea of
our method, the multiscale persistent entropy model is discussed in great
detail. Mathematically, unlike the previous persistent entropy or topological
entropy, a special resolution parameter is incorporated into our model. Various
scales can be achieved by tuning its value. Physically, our multiscale
persistent entropy can be used in conformation entropy evaluation. More
specifically, it is found that our method incorporates in it a natural
classification scheme. This is achieved through a density filtration of a
multiscale rigidity function built from bond and/or dihedral angle
distributions. To further validate our model, a systematical comparison with
the traditional entropy evaluation model is done. It is found that our model is
able to preserve the intrinsic topological features of biomolecular data much
better than traditional approaches, particularly for resolutions in the mediate
range. Moreover, our method can be successfully used in protein classification.
For a test database with around nine hundred proteins, a clear separation
between all-alpha and all-beta proteins can be achieved, using only the
dihedral and pseudo-bond angle information. Finally, a special protein
structure index (PSI) is proposed, for the first time, to describe the
""regularity"" of protein structures. Essentially, PSI can be used to describe
the ""regularity"" information in any systems.

  Engineering Regime Shifts"	"  Measures of wealth and production have been found to scale superlinearly with
the population of a city. Therefore, it makes economic sense for humans to
congregate together in dense settlements. A recent model of population dynamics
showed that population growth can become superexponential due to the
superlinear scaling of production with population in a city. Here, we
generalize this population dynamics model and demonstrate the existence of
multiple stable equilibrium points, showing how population growth can be
stymied by a poor economic environment. This occurs when the goods and services
produced by the city become less profitable due to a lack of diversification in
the city's economy. Then, relying on critical slowing down signals related to
the stability of an equilibrium point, we present an algorithm for engineering
regime shifts such that a city at a stable equilibrium point may continue to
grow again. The generality of the model and the algorithm used here implies
that the model and algorithm need not be restricted to urban systems; they are
easily applicable to other types of systems where the assumptions used are
valid.

  stimuli in human brains"	"  Multivariate Pattern (MVP) classification holds enormous potential for
decoding visual stimuli in the human brain by employing task-based fMRI data
sets. There is a wide range of challenges in the MVP techniques, i.e.
decreasing noise and sparsity, defining effective regions of interest (ROIs),
visualizing results, and the cost of brain studies. In overcoming these
challenges, this paper proposes a novel model of neural representation, which
can automatically detect the active regions for each visual stimulus and then
utilize these anatomical regions for visualizing and analyzing the functional
activities. Therefore, this model provides an opportunity for neuroscientists
to ask this question: what is the effect of a stimulus on each of the detected
regions instead of just study the fluctuation of voxels in the manually
selected ROIs. Moreover, our method introduces analyzing snapshots of brain
image for decreasing sparsity rather than using the whole of fMRI time series.
Further, a new Gaussian smoothing method is proposed for removing noise of
voxels in the level of ROIs. The proposed method enables us to combine
different fMRI data sets for reducing the cost of brain studies. Experimental
studies on 4 visual categories (words, consonants, objects and nonsense photos)
confirm that the proposed method achieves superior performance to
state-of-the-art methods.

are processed by the viral protease into individual components, resulting in
the formation of mature infectious particles. There are two competing models
for the process of forming the mature HIV-1 core: the disassembly and de novo
reassembly model and the non-diffusional displacive model. To study the
maturation pathway, we simulate HIV-1 maturation in vitro by digesting immature
particles and assembled virus-like particles with recombinant HIV-1 protease
and monitor the process with biochemical assays and cryoEM structural analysis
in parallel. Processing of Gag in vitro is accurate and efficient and results
in both soluble capsid protein and conical or tubular capsid assemblies,
seemingly converted from immature Gag particles. Computer simulations further
reveal probable assembly pathways of HIV-1 capsid formation. Combining the
experimental data and computer simulations, our results suggest a sequential
combination of both displacive and disassembly/reassembly processes for HIV-1
maturation.

establishment of infection. In addition to the primary role of the capsid
protein (CP) in encapsidating the RNA progeny, experimental evidence on
positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses suggests that the CP also regulates
RNA synthesis. Here, we demonstrate that replication of Satellite tobacco
mosaic virus (STMV) is controlled by the cooperative interaction between STMV
CP and the helper virus (HV) Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) replicase. We
identified that the STMV CP-HV replicase interaction requires a positively
charged residue at the third position (3R) in the N-terminal 13 amino acid (aa)
motif. Far-Northwestern blotting showed that STMV CP promotes binding between
HV-replicase and STMV RNA. An STMV CP variant having an arginine to alanine
substitution at position 3 in the N-terminal 13aa motif abolished replicase-CP
binding. The N-terminal 13aa motif of the CP bearing alanine substitutions for
positively charged residues located at positions 5, 7, 10 and 11 are defective
in packaging full-length STMV, but can package a truncated STMV RNA lacking the
3' terminal 150 nt region. These findings provide insights into the mechanism
underlying the regulation of STMV replication and packaging.

neurodegenerative disease. Many BCI systems make use of the phenomena of
event-related synchronization and de-synchronization of brain waves as a main
feature for classification of different cognitive tasks. However, the temporal
dynamics of the electroencephalographic (EEG) signals contain additional
information that can be incorporated into the inference engine in order to
improve the performance of the BCIs. This information about the dynamics of the
signals have been exploited previously in BCIs by means of generative and
discriminative methods. In particular, hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been
used in previous works. These methods have the disadvantage that the model
parameters such as the number of hidden states and the number of Gaussian
mixtures need to be fix ""a priori"". In this work, we propose a Bayesian
nonparametric model for brain signal classification that does not require ""a

mixtures of a HMM. The results show that the proposed model outperform other
methods based on HMM as well as the winner algorithm of the BCI competition IV.

1612.08742	q-bio	q-bio.OT	Flux ratios and channel structures	"  We investigate Ussing's unidirectional fluxes and flux ratios of charged
tracers motivated particularly by the insightful proposal of Hodgkin and Keynes
on a relation between flux ratios and channel structure. Our study is based on
analysis of quasi-one-dimensional Poisson-Nernst-Planck type models for ionic
flows through membrane channels. This class of models includes the Poisson
equation that determines the electrical potential from the charges present and
is in that sense consistent. Ussing's flux ratios generally depend on all
physical parameters involved in ionic flows, particularly, on bulk conditions
and channel structures. Certain setups of ion channel experiments result in
flux ratios that are universal in the sense that their values depend on bulk
conditions but not on channel structures; other setups lead to flux ratios that
are specific in the sense that their values depend on channel structures too.
Universal flux ratios could serve some purposes better than specific flux
ratios in some circumstances and worse in other circumstances. We focus on two
treatments of tracer flux measurements that serve as estimators of important
properties of ion channels. The first estimator determines the flux of the main
ion species from measurements of the flux of its tracer. Our analysis suggests
a better experimental design so that the flux ratio of the tracer flux and the
main ion flux is universal. The second treatment of tracer fluxes concerns
ratios of fluxes and experimental setups that try to determine some properties
of channel structure. We analyze the two widely used experimental designs of
estimating flux ratios and show that the most widely used method depends on the
spatial distribution of permanent charge so this flux ratio is specific and
thus allows estimation of (some of) the properties of that permanent charge,
even with ideal ionic solutions. ...

a large number of variables with multiple measures in time) provides the basis
for many downstream hypothesis generating tools. Here we propose a method,
Massively Parallel Analysis of Time Series (MPATS) that can be applied to
quantify transcriptome-wide perturbations. The proposed method characterizes
each individual time series through its $\ell_1$ distance to every other time
series. Application of MPATS to compare biological conditions produces a ranked
list of time series based on their magnitude of differences in their $\ell_1$
representation, which then can be further interpreted through enrichment
analysis. The performance of MPATS was validated through its application to a
study of IFN$\alpha$ dendritic cell responses to viral and bacterial infection.
In conjunction with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), MPATS produced
consistently identified signature gene sets of anti-bacterial and anti-viral
response. Traditional methods such as EDGE and GSEA Time Series (GSEA-TS)
failed to identify the relevant signature gene sets. Furthermore, the results
of MPATS highlighted the crucial functional difference between STAT1/STAT2
during anti-viral and anti-bacterial response. In our simulation study, MPATS
exhibited acceptable performance with small group size (n = 3), when the
appropriate effect size is considered. This method can be easily adopted for
other -omic data types.

  distinct cell polarity patterns within diverse cell populations"	"  Cell polarization and directional cell migration can display random,
persistent and oscillatory dynamic patterns. However, it is not clear if these
polarity patterns can be explained by the same underlying regulatory mechanism.
Here, we show that random, persistent and oscillatory migration accompanied by
polarization can simultaneously occur in populations of melanoma cells derived
from tumors with different degrees of aggressiveness. We demonstrate that all
these patterns and the probabilities of their occurrence are quantitatively
accounted for by a simple mechanism involving a spatially distributed,
mechano-chemical feedback coupling the dynamically changing extracellular
matrix (ECM)-cell contacts to the activation of signaling downstream of the
Rho-family small GTPases. This mechanism is supported by a predictive
mathematical model and extensive experimental validation, and can explain
previously reported results for diverse cell types. In melanoma, this mechanism
also accounts for the effects of genetic and environmental perturbations,
including mutations linked to invasive cell spread. The resulting mechanistic
understanding of cell polarity quantitatively captures the relationship between
population variability and phenotypic plasticity, with the potential to account
for a wide variety of cell migration states in diverse pathological and

1612.08995	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio.PE	Controlling uncertainty in aptamer selection	"  The search for high-affinity aptamers for targets such as proteins, small
molecules, or cancer cells remains a formidable endeavor. Systematic Evolution
of Ligands by EXponential Enrichment (SELEX) offers an iterative process to
discover these aptamers through evolutionary selection of high-affinity
candidates from a highly diverse random pool. This randomness dictates an
unknown population distribution of fitness parameters, encoded by the binding
affinities, toward SELEX targets. Adding to this uncertainty, repeating SELEX
under identical conditions may lead to variable outcomes. These uncertainties
pose a challenge when tuning selection pressures to isolate high-affinity
ligands. Here, we present a novel stochastic hybrid model that describes the
evolutionary selection of aptamers in order to explore the impact of these
unknowns. To our surprise, we find that even single copies of high-affinity
ligands in a pool of billions can strongly influence population dynamics, yet
their survival is highly dependent on chance. We perform Monte Carlo
simulations to explore the impact of environmental parameters, such as the
target concentration, on selection efficiency in SELEX and identify new
strategies to control these uncertainties to ultimately improve the outcome and
speed of this time- and resource-intensive process.

1612.09268	q-bio	q-bio.NC cs.CL physics.soc-ph	The ontogeny of discourse structure mimics the development of literature	"  Discourse varies with age, education, psychiatric state and historical epoch,
but the ontogenetic and cultural dynamics of discourse structure remain to be
quantitatively characterized. To this end we investigated word graphs obtained
from verbal reports of 200 subjects ages 2-58, and 676 literary texts spanning
~5,000 years. In healthy subjects, lexical diversity, graph size, and
long-range recurrence departed from initial near-random levels through a
monotonic asymptotic increase across ages, while short-range recurrence showed
a corresponding decrease. These changes were explained by education and suggest
a hierarchical development of discourse structure: short-range recurrence and
lexical diversity stabilize after elementary school, but graph size and
long-range recurrence only stabilize after high school. This gradual maturation
was blurred in psychotic subjects, who maintained in adulthood a near-random
structure. In literature, monotonic asymptotic changes over time were
remarkable: While lexical diversity, long-range recurrence and graph size
increased away from near-randomness, short-range recurrence declined, from
above to below random levels. Bronze Age texts are structurally similar to
childish or psychotic discourses, but subsequent texts converge abruptly to the
healthy adult pattern around the onset of the Axial Age (800-200 BC), a period
of pivotal cultural change. Thus, individually as well as historically,
discourse maturation increases the range of word recurrence away from
randomness.

astro-ph/0307543	q-bio	astro-ph q-bio.PE	"Importance of Biologically Active Aurora-like Ultraviolet Emission:
  Stochastic Irradiation of Earth and Mars by Flares and Explosions"	"  (Abridged) We show that sizeable fractions of incident ionizing radiation
from stochastic astrophysical sources can be redistributed to biologically and
chemically important UV wavelengths, a significant fraction of which can reach
the surface. This redistribution is mediated by secondary electrons, resulting
from Compton scattering and X-ray photoabsorption, with energies low enough to
excite atmospheric molecules and atoms, resulting in a rich aurora-like
spectrum. We calculate the fraction of energy redistributed into biologically
and chemically important wavelength regions for spectra characteristic of
stellar flares and supernovae using a Monte-Carlo transport code written for
this problem and then estimate the fraction of this energy that is transmitted
from the atmospheric altitudes of redistribution to the surface for a few
illustrative cases. Redistributed fractions are found to be of order 1%, even
in the presence of an ozone shield. This result implies that planetary
organisms will be subject to mutationally significant, if intermittent,
fluences of UV-B and harder radiation even in the presence of a narrow-band UV
shield like ozone. We also calculate the surficial transmitted fraction of
ionizing radiation and redistributed ultraviolet radiation for two illustrative
evolving Mars atmospheres whose initial surface pressures were 1 bar. Our
results suggest that coding organisms on planets orbiting low-mass stars (and
on the early Earth) may evolve very differently than on contemporary Earth,
with diversity and evolutionary rate controlled by a stochastically varying
mutation rate and frequent hypermutation episodes.

subtracting a running average based on a local window with a length of around
32 data points, and then, calculating the standard deviation of the detrended

on very short time-series of RR-data (7-8 minutes), which is a considerable

and canonical Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations of the systems tend to get
stuck in local metastable energy basins. A novel Monte Carlo algorithm is
developed to alleviate the problem of ``ergodicity breaking'' of the glassy
systems, in which the Markov process is driven by an explicitly analytic weight
factor with enhanced probability in both low- and high-energy regions. To
characterize the degree of puckering of the supercoiled DNA loops, a new
quantity of aplanarity is introduced as the shortest principal axis of
configurational ellipsoid of DNA. With the suggested Monte Carlo method, the
quantitative correlation between supercoiling degree and buckling of DNA is
attained. With supercoiling stress increasing, the conformational transition
from a circle to mono-, diplo- or triple interwound superhelical structure will
take place in a successive but decreasingly abrupt mode.

subordinated and a neutral interacting partner. Depending on their interaction
topologies, these systems can be classified into four (isomorphic) groups
exhibiting significantly different behaviors as a function of mutation rate. On
three out of four cases three (or four) species form defensive alliances which
maintain themselves in a self-organizing polydomain structure via cyclic

phenomenon analogous to that of magnetic Ising model.

Within a basic geometric modeling of the chromatin assembly, we give for the
first time the complete set of elastic constants (twist and bend persistence
lengths, stretch modulus and twist-stretch coupling constant) of the so-called
30-nm chromatin fiber, in terms of DNA elastic properties and geometric
properties of the fiber assembly. The computation naturally embeds the fiber
within a current analytical model known as the ``extensible worm-like rope'',
allowing a straightforward prediction of the force-extension curves. We show
that these elastic constants are strongly sensitive to the linker length, up to
1 bp, or equivalently to its twist, and might locally reach very low values,
yielding a highly flexible and extensible domain in the fiber. In particular,
the twist-stretch coupling constant, reflecting the chirality of the chromatin
fiber, exhibits steep variations and sign changes when the linker length is
varied.
  We argue that this tunable elasticity might be a key feature for chromatin
function, for instance in the initiation and regulation of transcription.

visually striking signature of actin polymerization-based motility. Similar
actin tails are associated with Shigella flexneri, spotted-fever Rickettsiae,
the Vaccinia virus, and vesicles and microspheres in related in vitro systems.
We show that the torque required to produce the curvature in the tail can arise
from randomly placed actin filaments pushing the bacterium or particle. We find
that the curvature magnitude determines the number of actively pushing
filaments, independent of viscosity and of the molecular details of force
generation. The variation of the curvature with time can be used to infer the
dynamics of actin filaments at the bacterial surface.

all the sequences and compact conformations (structures) for a protein folding
model on a cubic lattice of size $4\times3\times3$. We used two types of amino
acids -- hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) -- to make up the sequences, so there
were $2^{36} \approx 6.87 \times 10^{10}$ different sequences. The total number
of distinct structures was 84,731,192. We made use of a simple solvation model
in which the energy of a sequence folded into a structure is minus the number
of hydrophobic amino acids in the ``core'' of the structure. For every
sequence, we found its ground state or ground states, i.e., the structure or
structures for which its energy is lowest. About 0.3% of the sequences have a
unique ground state. The number of structures that are unique ground states of
at least one sequence is 2,662,050, about 3% of the total number of structures.
However, these ``designable'' structures differ drastically in their
designability, defined as the number of sequences whose unique ground state is
that structure. To understand this variation in designability, we studied the
distribution of structures in a high dimensional space in which each structure
is represented by a string of 1's and 0's, denoting core and surface sites,
respectively.

found in nature, the design of novel protein folds remains an open problem.
Within simple lattice models it has been shown that all structures are not
equally suitable for design. Rather, certain structures are distinguished by
unusually high designability: the number of amino-acid sequences for which they
represent the unique ground state; sequences associated with such structures
possess both robustness to mutation and thermodynamic stability. Here we report
that highly designable backbone conformations also emerge in a realistic
off-lattice model. The highly designable conformations of a chain of 23 amino
acids are identified, and found to be remarkably insensitive to model
parameters. While some of these conformations correspond closely to known
natural protein folds, such as the zinc finger and the helix-turn-helix motifs,
others do not resemble known folds and may be candidates for novel fold design.

is that slow growth of misfolded protein-aggregates from small initial seeds
controls the `latent' or `lag' phase, whereas aggregate-fissioning and
subsequent spreading leads to an exponential growth or doubling phase. Such a
general framework can account for many features of prion diseases including the
striking reproducibility of incubation times when high doses are inoculated
into lab animals. Broad incubation time distributions arise for low infectious
dose, while our calculated distributions narrow to sharply defined onset times
with increased dose. We apply our distributions to epidemiological vCJD data

distribution of latency periods, as well as the occurrence of infected
individuals not developing AIDS at all, is the dynamics of the long lasting
struggle between HIV and the immune system. Using a computer simulation, we
study the diversification of viral genomes under mutation and the selective
pressure of the immune system.In common infections vast spreading of viral
genomes usually does not takes place. In the case of an HIV infection this may
occur, as the virus successively weakens the immune system by depletion of CD4+
cells.In a sequence space framework, this leads to a dynamically induced
percolation transition, corresponding to the onset of AIDS. As a result, we
obtain the prolongated shape of the incubation period distribution, as well as
a finite fraction of non-progressors that do not develop AIDS, comparing well
with results from recent clinical research.

  The macro-dynamics exhibit intermittent two mode switching with a gradually

by complex dynamics with a new method: the Diffusion Entropy Analysis (DEA)
(Fractals, {\bf 9}, 193 (2001)). This method is based on the evaluation of the
Shannon entropy of the diffusion process generated by the time series imagined
as a physical source of fluctuations, rather than on the measurement of the
variance of this diffusion process, as done with the traditional methods. We
compare the DEA to the traditional methods of scaling detection and we prove
that the DEA is the only method that always yields the correct scaling value,
if the scaling condition applies. Furthermore, DEA detects the real scaling of
a time series without requiring any form of de-trending. We show that the joint
use of DEA and variance method allows to assess whether a time series is
characterized by L\'{e}vy or Gauss statistics. We apply the DEA to the study of
DNA sequences, and we prove that their large-time scales are characterized by
L\'{e}vy statistics, regardless of whether they are coding or non-coding
sequences. We show that the DEA is a reliable technique and, at the same time,
we use it to confirm the validity of the dynamic approach to the DNA sequences,
proposed in earlier work.

of two mutually avoiding random walks, whose reunion exponent is c > 2, both in
two and three dimensions. Analytical estimates of c due to the interactions

the transition is even sharper than in models where excluded volume effects are
fully incorporated. The probability distribution of distances between

determined by the topology of the genome space. It is modeled by the random
Bethe lattice. We use the effective medium and single-defect approximations to
find the criteria, under which the localized quasispecies cloud is created. We
find that shorter genomes, which are more robust to random mutations than

the interplay between the mechanical properties of the chromatin fiber and its
biological functions. A quantitative step is to relate the mechanics at the DNA
level and the mechanics described at the chromatin fiber level. It allows to
calculate the complete set of chromatin elastic constants (twist and bend
persistence lengths, stretch modulus and twist-stretch coupling constant), in
terms of DNA elastic properties and geometric features of the fiber. These
elastic constants are strongly sensitive to the local architecture of the fiber
and we argue that this tunable elasticity might be a key feature in chromatin

Moreover, this analysis provides a framework to interpret micromanipulations

forming the first structural level of organization of eukaryotic chromosomes.
In tightly organized chromatin fibers, the short segments of naked DNA linking
the nucleosomes are strongly end constrained. Longitudinal thermal fluctuations
in these linkers allow intercalative mode of protein binding. We show that
mechanical constraints generated in the first stage of the binding process
induce linker DNA buckling; buckling in turn modifies the binding energies and
activation barriers and creates a force of decondensation at the chromatin
fiber level. The unique structure and properties of DNA thus yield a novel
physical mechanism of buckling instability that might play a key role in the

apposed bilayers formed by amphiphilic molecules within the framework of a
coarse grained lattice model. The fusion pathway differs from the usual stalk
mechanism. Stalks do form between the apposed bilayers, but rather than expand
radially to form an axial-symmetric hemifusion diaphragm of the trans leaves of
both bilayers, they promote in their vicinity the nucleation of small holes in
the bilayers. Two subsequent paths are observed: (i) The stalk encircles a hole
in one bilayer creating a diaphragm comprised of both leaves of the other
intact bilayer, and which ruptures to complete the fusion pore. (ii) Before the
stalk can encircle a hole in one bilayer, a second hole forms in the other
bilayer, and the stalk aligns and encircles them both to complete the fusion
pore. Both pathways give rise to mixing between the cis and trans leaves of the
bilayer and allow for transient leakage.

denaturation bubbles in a long, stretched random sequence of DNA. The small
bubbles associated with weak twist are delocalized. Above a threshold torque,
the bubbles of several tens of bases or larger become preferentially localized
to \AT-rich segments. In the localized regime, the bubbles exhibit ``aging''
and move around sub-diffusively with continuously varying dynamic exponents.
These properties are derived using results of large-deviation theory together
with scaling arguments, and are verified by Monte-Carlo simulations.

poly d(A)-poly d(T) DNA oligomers of various lengths in different buffer
conditions. Our findings are in clear disagreement with two state, reaction
kinetics model, and we find that the so-called zipper model, where denaturing
proceeds through opening of the duplex at the ends describes well the
temperature dependence of the average number of open base pairs. Analysis of
the length dependence of the transition parameters however suggest that bubble
formation is important and that the transition, in the thermodynamic limit, is
continuous, albeit close to first order.

and child-care strategies are considered. To implement this model in an

dinucleotides (or dimers) measured by different teams has raised a yet
unsettled debate. Here the free energy is fitted by a three parameter empiric
formula derived in the framework of the crystal basis model of genetic code.
Sum rules are derived and compared satisfactorily with the data. On the basis
of theoretical and phenomenological arguments, a relation between the
correlation functions of dimer distribution and the free energy is assumed.
  From consistency conditions, sum rules are derived. A check of these
conditions with different samples of experimental data is performed, allowing
us to argue on the reliability of the different sets of experimental data.

cond-mat/0309386	q-bio	cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.soft q-bio.CB	"Interplay of chemotaxis and chemokinesis mechanisms in bacterial
  dynamics"	"  Motivated by observations of the dynamics of {\it Myxococcus xanthus}, we
present a self-interacting random walk model that describes the competition
between chemokinesis and chemotaxis. Cells are constrained to move in one
dimension, but release a chemical chemoattractant at a steady state. The
bacteria senses the chemical that it produces. The probability of direction
reversals is modeled as a function of both the absolute level of
chemoattractant sensed directly under each cell as well as the gradient sensed
across the length of the cell. If the chemical does not degrade or diffuse
rapidly, the one dimensional trajectory depends on the entire past history of
the trajectory. We derive the corresponding Fokker-Planck equations, use an
iterative mean field approach that we solve numerically for short times, and
perform extensive Monte-Carlo simulations of the model. Cell positional
distributions and the associated moments are computed in this feedback system.
Average drift and mean squared displacements are found. Crossover behavior
among different diffusion regimes are found.

cond-mat/0309495	q-bio	cond-mat q-bio.SC	"Autonomous Energy Transducer: Proposition, Example, Basic
  Characteristics"	"  We propose a concept of autonomous energy transducer at a molecular scale,
where output is produced with small input energy, of the same order of the
thermal energy, without restriction of magnitude or timing of input, and
without any control after the input. As an example that satisfies these
requisites, a dynamical systems model with several degrees of freedom is
proposed, which transduces input energy to output motion on the average. It is
shown that this transduction is robust and the coupling between the input and
output is generally loose. How this transducer works is analyzed in terms of
dynamical systems theory, where chaotic dynamics of the internal degrees of
freedom, as well as duration of active state which is self-organized with the
energy flow, is essential. We also discuss possible relationships to enzyme
dynamics or protein motors.

cond-mat/0312453	q-bio	cond-mat.soft q-bio.QM	"Field theoretic study of bilayer membrane fusion: I. Hemifusion
  mechanism"	"  Self-consistent field theory is used to determine structural and energetic
properties of metastable intermediates and unstable transition states involved
in the standard stalk mechanism of bilayer membrane fusion. A microscopic model
of flexible amphiphilic chains dissolved in hydrophilic solvent is employed to
describe these self-assembled structures. We find that the barrier to formation
of the initial stalk is much smaller than previously estimated by
phenomenological theories. Therefore its creation it is not the rate limiting
process. The barrier which is relevant is associated with the rather limited
radial expansion of the stalk into a hemifusion diaphragm. It is strongly
affected by the architecture of the amphiphile, decreasing as the effective
spontaneous curvature of the amphiphile is made more negative. It is also
reduced when the tension is increased. At high tension the fusion pore, created
when a hole forms in the hemifusion diaphragm, expands without bound. At very
low membrane tension, small fusion pores can be trapped in a flickering
metastable state. Successful fusion is severely limited by the architecture of
the lipids. If the effective spontaneous curvature is not sufficiently
negative, fusion does not occur because metastable stalks, whose existence is a
seemingly necessary prerequisite, do not form at all. However if the
spontaneous curvature is too negative, stalks are so stable that fusion does
not occur because the system is unstable either to a phase of stable radial
stalks, or to an inverted-hexagonal phase induced by stable linear stalks. Our
results on the architecture and tension needed for successful fusion are
summarized in a phase diagram.

wavelength dynamics in a phospholipid bilayer. We show that inelastic neutron
scattering using a triple-axis spectrometer at the high flux reactor of the ILL
yields the necessary resolution and signal to determine the dynamics of model
membranes. The results can quantitatively be compared to recent Molecular
Dynamics simulations. Reflectivity, in-plane correlations and the corresponding
dynamics can be measured simultaneously to gain a maximum amount of
information. With this method, dispersion relations can be measured with a high
energy resolution. Structure and dynamics in phospholipid bilayers, and the
relation between them, can be studied on a molecular length scale.

studied using chick embryonic cells and numerical simulations based on the
cellular Potts model. Our results show exponential relaxation in both cases as
verified in previous studies using 2D Hydra cell aggregates. The relaxation
time decreases with higher surface tension as expected from hydrodynamics laws.
However, it increases faster than linearly with aggregate size. The results
provide an additional support to the validity of the cellular Potts model for
non-equilibrium situations and indicate that aggregate shape relaxation is not
governed by the hydrodynamics of viscous liquids.

different values of the exponent $\beta$. The signal of the model consists of
pulses or events. The interpulse, interevent, interarrival, recurrence or
waiting times of the signal are described by the general Langevin equation with
the multiplicative noise and stochastically diffuse in some interval resulting
in the power-law distribution. Our model is free from the requirement of a wide
distribution of relaxation times and from the power-law forms of the pulses. It
contains only one relaxation rate and yields $1/f^ {\beta}$ spectra in a wide
range of frequency. We obtain explicit expressions for the power spectra and
present numerical illustrations of the model. Further we analyze the relation
of the point process model of $1/f$ noise with the Bernamont-Surdin-McWhorter
model, representing the signals as a sum of the uncorrelated components. We
show that the point process model is complementary to the model based on the
sum of signals with a wide-range distribution of the relaxation times. In
contrast to the Gaussian distribution of the signal intensity of the sum of the
uncorrelated components, the point process exhibits asymptotically a power-law
distribution of the signal intensity. The developed multiplicative point
process model of $1/f^{\beta}$ noise may be used for modeling and analysis of
stochastic processes in different systems with the power-law distribution of
the intensity of pulsing signals.

  Filament Aggregation"	"  The phase behavior of charged rods in the presence of inter-rod linkers is
studied theoretically as a model for the equilibrium behavior underlying the
organization of actin filaments by linker proteins in the cytoskeleton. The
presence of linkers in the solution modifies the effective inter-rod
interaction and can lead to inter-filament attraction. Depending on the
system's composition and physical properties such as linker binding energies,
filaments will either orient perpendicular or parallel to each other, leading
to network-like or bundled structures. We show that such a system can have one
of three generic phase diagrams, one dominated by bundles, another by networks,
and the third containing both bundle and network-like phases. The first two
diagrams can be found over a wide range of interaction energies, while the
third occurs only for a narrow range. These results provide theoretical
understanding of the classification of linker proteins as bundling proteins or
crosslinking proteins. In addition, they suggest possible mechanisms by which
the cell may control cytoskeletal morphology.

adsorption at liquid-solid interfaces. First describing the equilibrium state
under varying protein concentration of the solution and binding conditions, we
predict a non-trivial (non- monotonic) dependence of the experimentally
observable properties of the adsorbed layer (such as the surface density and
surface coverage) on these parameters. We subsequently proceed to develop a
dynamical model consistent with the equilibrium description, which
qualitatively reproduces known experimental phenomena and offers a promising
way of studying the exchange of the adsorbed proteins by the proteins of the

  applications"	"  I review single-molecule experiments (SME) in biological physics. Recent
technological developments have provided the tools to design and build
scientific instruments of high enough sensitivity and precision to manipulate
and visualize individual molecules and measure microscopic forces. Using SME it
is possible to: manipulate molecules one at a time and measure distributions
describing molecular properties; characterize the kinetics of biomolecular
reactions and; detect molecular intermediates. SME provide the additional
information about thermodynamics and kinetics of biomolecular processes. This
complements information obtained in traditional bulk assays. In SME it is also
possible to measure small energies and detect large Brownian deviations in
biomolecular reactions, thereby offering new methods and systems to scrutinize
the basic foundations of statistical mechanics. This review is written at a
very introductory level emphasizing the importance of SME to scientists
interested in knowing the common playground of ideas and the interdisciplinary
topics accessible by these techniques. The review discusses SME from an
experimental perspective, first exposing the most common experimental
methodologies and later presenting various molecular systems where such
techniques have been applied. I briefly discuss experimental techniques such as
atomic-force microscopy (AFM), laser optical tweezers (LOT), magnetic tweezers
(MT), biomembrane force probe (BFP) and single-molecule fluorescence (SMF). I
then present several applications of SME to the study of nucleic acids (DNA,
RNA and DNA condensation), proteins (protein-protein interactions, protein
folding and molecular motors). Finally, I discuss applications of SME to the
study of the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of small systems and the
experimental verification of fluctuation theorems. I conclude with a discussion
of open questions and future perspectives.

diffusional coefficients and free energy profiles are determined from Monte
Carlo simulations of a 27-mer, 3 letter code lattice model, which corresponds
roughly to a small helical protein. Analytic folding calculations, using simple

studied within the populational genetics framework of the quasispecies model.

cond-mat/9612151	q-bio	cond-mat.soft q-bio	"Mapping vesicle shapes into the phase diagram: A comparison of
  experiment and theory"	"  Phase-contrast microscopy is used to monitor the shapes of micron-scale
fluid-phase phospholipid-bilayer vesicles in aqueous solution. At fixed
temperature, each vesicle undergoes thermal shape fluctuations. We are able
experimentally to characterize the thermal shape ensemble by digitizing the
vesicle outline in real time and storing the time-sequence of images. Analysis
of this ensemble using the area-difference-elasticity (ADE) model of vesicle
shapes allows us to associate (map) each time-sequence to a point in the
zero-temperature (shape) phase diagram. Changing the laboratory temperature
modifies the control parameters (area, volume, etc.) of each vesicle, so it
sweeps out a trajectory across the theoretical phase diagram. It is a
nontrivial test of the ADE model to check that these trajectories remain
confined to regions of the phase diagram where the corresponding shapes are
locally stable. In particular, we study the thermal trajectories of three
prolate vesicles which, upon heating, experienced a mechanical instability
leading to budding. We verify that the position of the observed instability and
the geometry of the budded shape are in reasonable accord with the theoretical
predictions. The inability of previous experiments to detect the ``hidden''
control parameters (relaxed area difference and spontaneous curvature) make
this the first direct quantitative confrontation between vesicle-shape theory
and experiment.

cond-mat/9703089	q-bio	cond-mat q-bio	Suggested Model for the Origin of Mosaic Structure of DNA	"  In view of the critical behavior exhibited by a statistical model describing
a one dimensional crystal containing isotopic impurities and the fact that for
impurity mass parameter 3 times the host mass the critical temperature can
attain very high values, we suggest that the mosaic structure displayed by
certain nucleic acids (DNA) of eukaryotic organisms might have had its origins
in a phenomenon of condensation of codons ocurred at prebiotic conditions. An
appropriated map of that model onto some of the DNA features allows one to
predict power law behavior for both correlation functions and exons size
distribution in binary sequences of nucleotides which are distinguished by
their protein coding or noncoding functions. Preliminary studies of these
quantities performed on intron-containing sequences from GenBank are presented
here.

macromolecules in populations characterized by a single-peaked fitness
landscape. The use of ideas and tools borrowed from polymers theory and
statistical mechanics, allows us to exactly solve the model for generic DNA
lengths d. The mathematical shape of the quasi-species confined around the
master sequence is perturbatively found in powers of 1/d at large d. We
rigorously prove the existence of the error-threshold phenomenon and study the
quasi-species formation in the general context of critical phase transitions in
physics. No sharp transitions exist at any finite d, and at $d\to \infty$ the
transition is of first order. The typical r.m.s. amplitude of a quasi-species
around the master sequence is found to diverge algebraically with exponent
$\nu_{\perp}=1$ at the transition to the delocalized phase in the limit $d\to
\infty$.

regime of small supercoiling. The partition function is mapped to the path
integral representation for a quantum charged particle in the field of a
magnetic monopole with unquantized charge.
  We show that the theory is singular in the continuum limit and must be
regularised at an intermediate length scale. We find good agreement with
existing experimental data, and point out how to measure the twist rigidity
accurately.

of finite populations is proposed, in which the population is assumed to be a
random combination of the constiyuent molecules in each generation,i.e.,
linkage disequilibrium at the population level is neglected. In particular, for
the single-sharp-peak replication landscape we investigate the dependence of
the error threshold on the population size and find that the replication
accuracy at threshold increases linearly with the reciprocal of the population
size for sufficiently large populations. Furthermore, in the deterministic
limit our formulation yields the exact steady-state of the quasispecies model,
indicating then the population composition is a random combination of the
molecules.

formation of native structure and the free energy profile along the folding

some fine structure due to local folding topology.

t are studied for a number of systems, including realistic models of proteins
(PPT, BPTI and myoglobin). The fractal dimension of V(t), characterized by the
exponent \gamma, is almost independent of temperature and increases with time,
more slowly the larger the protein. Perhaps the most striking observation of
this study is the apparent universality of the fractal dimension, which depends
only weakly on the type of molecular system. We explain this behavior by
assuming that fractality is caused by a self-generated dynamical noise, a
consequence of intermode coupling due to anharmonicity. Global topological
features of the potential energy landscape are found to have little effect on
the observed fractal behavior.

  Protein Models"	"  Background: Designing amino acid sequences that are stable in a given target
structure amounts to maximizing a conditional probability. A straightforward
approach to accomplish this is a nested Monte Carlo where the conformation
space is explored over and over again for different fixed sequences, which
requires excessive computational demand. Several approximate attempts to remedy
this situation, based on energy minimization for fixed structure or high-$T$
expansions, have been proposed. These methods are fast but often not accurate
since folding occurs at low $T$.
  Results: We develop a multisequence Monte Carlo procedure, where both
sequence and conformation space are simultaneously probed with efficient
prescriptions for pruning sequence space. The method is explored on
hydrophobic/polar models. We first discuss short lattice chains, in order to
compare with exact data and with other methods. The method is then successfully
applied to lattice chains with up to 50 monomers, and to off-lattice 20-mers.
  Conclusions: The multisequence Monte Carlo method offers a new approach to
sequence design in coarse-grained models. It is much more efficient than
previous Monte Carlo methods, and is, as it stands, applicable to a fairly wide
range of two-letter models.

evidence for multifractality in a biological dynamical system --- the healthy

evolution of the population and equilibrium properties of a statistical
mechanics system is investigated, finding the limits for which this mapping
holds. The mutational meltdown, Eigen's error threshold and Muller's ratchet
phenomena are studied in the framework of a simplified model. Finally, the
shape of a quasi-species and the condition of coexistence of multiple species
in a static fitness landscape are analyzed. In the second part, these results
are applied to the study of the coexistence of quasi-species in the presence of
competition, obtaining the conditions for a robust speciation effect in asexual

upper limits for the mutation rate above which mutation can no longer be
controlled by selection, the most important phenomena being error thresholds,
Muller's ratchet, and mutational meltdowns. Error thresholds are deterministic
phenomena, whereas Muller's ratchet requires the stochastic component brought
about by finite population size. Mutational meltdowns additionally rely on an
explicit model of population dynamics, and describe the extinction of
populations. Special emphasis is put on the mutual relationship between these
phenomena. Finally, a few connections with the process of molecular evolution
are established.

  Molecule"	"  Common experience tells us that a knot significantly weakens the polymer
strand in which it is tied, which in turn leads to more facile chain rupture
under tensile loading. Using first-principles molecular dynamics calculations
we describe the dynamical evolution of the radicals that form after chain
rupture of a single knotted alkane molecule in their very early stages of life.
They are able to recombine, to form cyclic alkanes and to undergo
disproportionation phenomena with nearby chain segments. The breaking of a
single knotted polymer chain under mechanical loading is thus predicted to
reveal phenomena falling in the domain of ultrafast spectroscopy.

periods for healthy individuals, cosmonauts during orbital flight, and subjects
with severe heart disease. For all three groups, we find a greater degree of
anticorrelation in the heartbeat fluctuations during sleep compared to wake
periods. The sleep-wake difference in the scaling exponents for the three
groups is comparable to the difference between healthy and diseased
individuals. The observed scaling differences are not accounted for simply by
different levels of activity, but appear related to intrinsic changes in the
neuroautonomic control of the heartbeat.

either through stable intermediates or through a two-state process without
intermediates. The rather short folding times of the two-state process indicate
that folding is guided. We reconcile these two seemingly contradictory
observations quantitatively in a schematic model of protein folding. We propose
a new dynamical transition temperature which is lower than the thermodynamic
one, in qualitative agreement with in vivo measurement of protein stability
using E.coli. Finally we demonstrate that our framework is easily generalized
to encompass cold unfolding, and make predictions that relate the sharpness of
the cold and hot unfolding transitions.

  Synchronizing Multi-Regular Language Filters"	"  In the computational-mechanics structural analysis of one-dimensional
cellular automata the following automata-theoretic analogue of the
\emph{change-point problem} from time series analysis arises: \emph{Given a
string $\sigma$ and a collection $\{\mc{D}_i\}$ of finite automata, identify
the regions of $\sigma$ that belong to each $\mc{D}_i$ and, in particular, the
boundaries separating them.} We present two methods for solving this
\emph{multi-regular language filtering problem}. The first, although providing
the ideal solution, requires a stack, has a worst-case compute time that grows
quadratically in $\sigma$'s length and conditions its output at any point on
arbitrarily long windows of future input. The second method is to
algorithmically construct a transducer that approximates the first algorithm.
In contrast to the stack-based algorithm, however, the transducer requires only
a finite amount of memory, runs in linear time, and gives immediate output for
each letter read; it is, moreover, the best possible finite-state approximation
with these three features.

nonsingularity condition for the learning problem. Learning hidden Markov
models without the nonsingularity condition is at least as hard as learning

  Geological Significance"	"  The `Cyborg Astrobiologist' (CA) has undergone a second geological field
trial, at a red sandstone site in northern Guadalajara, Spain, near Riba de
Santiuste. The Cyborg Astrobiologist is a wearable computer and video camera
system that has demonstrated a capability to find uncommon interest points in
geological imagery in real-time in the field. The first (of three) geological
structures that we studied was an outcrop of nearly homogeneous sandstone,
which exhibits oxidized-iron impurities in red and and an absence of these iron
impurities in white. The white areas in these ``red beds'' have turned white
because the iron has been removed by chemical reduction, perhaps by a
biological agent. The computer vision system found in one instance several
(iron-free) white spots to be uncommon and therefore interesting, as well as
several small and dark nodules. The second geological structure contained
white, textured mineral deposits on the surface of the sandstone, which were
found by the CA to be interesting. The third geological structure was a 50 cm
thick paleosol layer, with fossilized root structures of some plants, which
were found by the CA to be interesting. A quasi-blind comparison of the Cyborg
Astrobiologist's interest points for these images with the interest points
determined afterwards by a human geologist shows that the Cyborg Astrobiologist
concurred with the human geologist 68% of the time (true positive rate), with a
32% false positive rate and a 32% false negative rate.

math/0510453	q-bio	math.PR q-bio.PE	"Individual-based probabilistic models of adaptive evolution and various
  scaling approximations"	"  We are interested in modelling Darwinian evolution, resulting from the
interplay of phenotypic variation and natural selection through ecological
interactions. Our models are rooted in the microscopic, stochastic description
of a population of discrete individuals characterized by one or several
adaptive traits. The population is modelled as a stochastic point process whose
generator captures the probabilistic dynamics over continuous time of birth,
mutation, and death, as influenced by each individual's trait values, and
interactions between individuals. An offspring usually inherits the trait
values of her progenitor, except when a mutation causes the offspring to take
an instantaneous mutation step at birth to new trait values. We look for
tractable large population approximations. By combining various scalings on
population size, birth and death rates, mutation rate, mutation step, or time,
a single microscopic model is shown to lead to contrasting macroscopic limits,
of different nature: deterministic, in the form of ordinary, integro-, or
partial differential equations, or probabilistic, like stochastic partial
differential equations or superprocesses. In the limit of rare mutations, we
show that a possible approximation is a jump process, justifying rigorously the
so-called trait substitution sequence. We thus unify different points of view
concerning mutation-selection evolutionary models.

math/0604041	q-bio	math.PR q-bio.PE	"Invasion and adaptive evolution for individual-based spatially
  structured populations"	"  The interplay between space and evolution is an important issue in population
dynamics, that is in particular crucial in the emergence of polymorphism and
spatial patterns. Recently, biological studies suggest that invasion and
evolution are closely related. Here we model the interplay between space and
evolution starting with an individual-based approach and show the important
role of parameter scalings on clustering and invasion. We consider a stochastic
discrete model with birth, death, competition, mutation and spatial diffusion,
where all the parameters may depend both on the position and on the trait of
individuals. The spatial motion is driven by a reflected diffusion in a bounded
domain. The interaction is modelled as a trait competition between individuals
within a given spatial interaction range. First, we give an algorithmic
construction of the process. Next, we obtain large population approximations,
as weak solutions of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations with Neumann's
boundary conditions. As the spatial interaction range is fixed, the
nonlinearity is nonlocal. Then, we make the interaction range decrease to zero
and prove the convergence to spatially localized nonlinear reaction-diffusion
equations, with Neumann's boundary conditions. Finally, simulations based on
the microscopic individual-based model are given, illustrating the strong
effects of the spatial interaction range on the emergence of spatial and
phenotypic diversity (clustering and polymorphism) and on the interplay between
invasion and evolution. The simulations focus on the qualitative differences
between local and nonlocal interactions.

CGR-tree turns a sequence of letters into a digital search tree (DST), obtained
from the suffixes of the reversed sequence. Several results are known
concerning the height and the insertion depth for DST built from i.i.d.
successive sequences. Here, the successive inserted wors are strongly
dependent. We give the asymptotic behaviour of the insertion depth and of the
length of branches for the CGR-tree obtained from the suffixes of reversed
i.i.d. or Markovian sequence. This behaviour turns out to be at first order the
same one as in the case of independent words. As a by-product, asymptotic
results on the length of longest runs in a Markovian sequence are obtained.

stabilization of a class of $n$-dimensional nonlinear positive systems
possessing a one-dimensional unknown, though measured, part. We first propose
our main result, an output feedback control procedure, taking advantage of
measurements of the uncertain part, able to globally stabilize the system
towards an adjustable equilibrium point in the interior of the positive
orthant. Though quite general, this result is based on hypotheses that might be
difficult to check in practice. Then in a second step, through a Theorem on a
class of positive systems linking the existence of a strongly positive
equillibrium to its global asymptotic stability, we propose other hypotheses
for our main result to hold. These new hypotheses are more restrictive but much
simpler to check. Some illustrative examples, highlighting both the potential
complex open loop dynamics (multi-stability, limit cycle, chaos) of the
considered systems and the interest of the control procedure, conclude this
report.

invariants for a general group-based model on an arbitrary claw tree. We focus
on the group $\mathbb Z_2$ and choose a natural recursive approach that extends
to other groups. The study of the lattice associated with each phylogenetic
ideal produces a list of circuits that generate the corresponding lattice
ideal. In addition, we describe explicitly a quadratic lexicographic
Gr\""{o}bner basis of the toric ideal of invariants for the claw tree on an
arbitrary number of leaves. Combined with a result of Sturmfels and Sullivant,
this implies that the phylogenetic ideal of every tree for the group $\mathbb

variety is a Koszul algebra.

math/9412222	q-bio	math.CO q-bio	Efficient pooling designs for library screening	"  We describe efficient methods for screening clone libraries, based on pooling
schemes which we call ``random $k$-sets designs''. In these designs, the pools
in which any clone occurs are equally likely to be any possible selection of
$k$ from the $v$ pools. The values of $k$ and $v$ can be chosen to optimize
desirable properties. Random $k$-sets designs have substantial advantages over
alternative pooling schemes: they are efficient, flexible, easy to specify,
require fewer pools, and have error-correcting and error-detecting
capabilities. In addition, screening can often be achieved in only one pass,
thus facilitating automation. For design comparison, we assume a binomial
distribution for the number of ``positive'' clones, with parameters $n$, the
number of clones, and $c$, the coverage. We propose the expected number of {\em
resolved positive} clones---clones which are definitely positive based upon the
pool assays---as a criterion for the efficiency of a pooling design. We
determine the value of $k$ which is optimal, with respect to this criterion, as
a function of $v$, $n$ and $c$. We also describe superior $k$-sets designs
called $k$-sets packing designs. As an illustration, we discuss a robotically
implemented design for a 2.5-fold-coverage, human chromosome 16 YAC library of
$n=1,298$ clones. We also estimate the probability each clone is positive,
given the pool-assay data and a model for experimental errors.

important role, evolution itself being portrayed as a hill-climbing process on
a rugged landscape. In this article it is shown that in general, in the
presence of other genetic operators such as mutation and recombination,
hill-climbing is the exception rather than the rule. This descrepency can be
traced to the different ways that the concept of fitness appears --- as a
measure of the number of fit offspring, or as a measure of the probability to
reach reproductive age. Effective fitness models the former not the latter and
gives an intuitive way to understand population dynamics as flows on an
effective fitness landscape when genetic operators other than selection play an
important role. The efficacy of the concept is shown using several simple
analytic examples and also some more complicated cases illustrated by
simulations.

landscapes via mutation and recombination. With these search procedures,
exploration is difficult in ""rugged"" fitness landscapes, where small mutations
can drastically change functionalities in an organism. Random Boolean networks
(RBNs), being general models, can be used to explore theories of how evolution
can take place in rugged landscapes; or even change the landscapes.
  In this paper, we study the effect that redundant nodes have on the
robustness of RBNs. Using computer simulations, we have found that the addition
of redundant nodes to RBNs increases their robustness. We conjecture that
redundancy is a way of ""smoothening"" fitness landscapes. Therefore, redundancy
can facilitate evolutionary searches. However, too much redundancy could reduce
the rate of adaptation of an evolutionary process. Our results also provide
supporting evidence in favour of Kauffman's conjecture (Kauffman, 2000, p.195).

byproducts of respiration. Our approach consists of coupling the cell density
field to a chemoattractant concentration as well as to nutrient and waste
fields. The latter serves as a triggering field for emission of
chemoattractant. Important elements in the proposed model include the
propagation of a front of motile bacteria radially outward form an initial
site, a Turing instability of the uniformly dense state and a reduction of
motility for cells sufficiently far behind the front. The wide variety of
patterns seen in the experiments is explained as being due the variation of the
details of the initiation of the chemoattractant emission as well as the
transition to a non-motile phase.

identifies genomic complexity with the amount of information a sequence stores
about its environment. We investigate the evolution of genomic complexity in

assess the presence or likelihood of cardiovascular disease. We examine sixteen
such measures and their suitability for correctly classifying heartbeat records
of various lengths as normal or revealing the presence of cardiac dysfunction,
particularly congestive heart failure. Using receiver-operating-characteristic
analysis we demonstrate that scale-dependent measures prove substantially
superior to scale-independent ones. The wavelet-transform standard deviation at
a scale near 32 heartbeat intervals, and its spectral counterpart near 1/32
cycles/interval, turn out to provide reliable results using heartbeat records
just minutes long. We further establish for all subjects that the human
heartbeat has an underlying stochastic origin rather than arising from a
chaotic attractor. Finally, we develop a mathematical point process that
emulates the human heartbeat time series for both normal subjects and
heart-failure patients.

physics/0207024	q-bio	physics.bio-ph q-bio	"Clustering of SNPs along a chromosome: can the neutral model be
  rejected?"	"  Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) often appear in clusters along the
length of a chromosome. This is due to variation in local coalescent times
caused by,for example, selection or recombination. Here we investigate whether
recombination alone (within a neutral model) can cause statistically
significant SNP clustering. We measure the extent of SNP clustering as the
ratio between the variance of SNPs found in bins of length $l$, and the mean
number of SNPs in such bins, $\sigma^2_l/\mu_l$. For a uniform SNP distribution
$\sigma^2_l/\mu_l=1$, for clustered SNPs $\sigma^2_l/\mu_l > 1$. Apart from the
bin length, three length scales are important when accounting for SNP
clustering: The mean distance between neighboring SNPs, $\Delta$, the mean
length of chromosome segments with constant time to the most recent common
ancestor, $\el$, and the total length of the chromosome, $L$. We show that SNP
clustering is observed if $\Delta < \el \ll L$. Moreover, if $l\ll \el \ll L$,
clustering becomes independent of the rate of recombination. We apply our
results to the analysis of SNP data sets from mice, and human chromosomes 6 and
X. Of the three data sets investigated, the human X chromosome displays the
most significant deviation from neutrality.

  quasispecies"	"  The probability that an advantageous mutant rises to fixation in a viral
quasispecies is investigated in the framework of multi-type branching
processes. Whether fixation is possible depends on the overall growth rate of
the quasispecies that will form if invasion is successful, rather than on the
individual fitness of the invading mutant. The exact fixation probability can
only be calculated if the fitnesses of all potential members of the invading
quasispecies are known. Quasispecies fixation has two important
characteristics: First, a sequence with negative selection coefficient has a
positive fixation probability as long as it has the potential to grow into a
quasispecies with an overall growth rate that exceeds the one of the
established quasispecies. Second, the fixation probabilities of sequences with
identical fitnesses can nevertheless vary over many orders of magnitudes. Two
approximations for the probability of fixation are introduced. Both
approximations require only partial knowledge about the potential members of
the invading quasispecies. The performance of these two approximations is
compared to the exact fixation probability on a network of RNA sequences with
identical secondary structure.

dependent interactions is first established by computing orientational order
parameters for proteins with alpha-helical and beta-sheet architecture.
Extraction of the anisotropic interactions requires defining local reference
frames for each amino acid that uniquely determine the coordinates of the
neighboring residues. Using the local reference frames and histograms of the
radial and angular correlation functions for a standard set of non-homologue
protein structures, we construct the anisotropic pair potentials. The
performance of the orientation dependent potentials was studied using a large

  properties of extracellular space"	"  Extracellular local field potentials (LFP) are usually modeled as arising
from a set of current sources embedded in a homogeneous extracellular medium.
Although this formalism can successfully model several properties of LFPs, it
does not account for their frequency-dependent attenuation with distance, a
property essential to correctly model extracellular spikes. Here we derive
expressions for the extracellular potential that include this
frequency-dependent attenuation. We first show that, if the extracellular
conductivity is non-homogeneous, there is induction of non-homogeneous charge
densities which may result in a low-pass filter. We next derive a simplified
model consisting of a punctual (or spherical) current source with
spherically-symmetric conductivity/permittivity gradients around the source. We
analyze the effect of different radial profiles of conductivity and
permittivity on the frequency-filtering behavior of this model. We show that
this simple model generally displays low-pass filtering behavior, in which fast
electrical events (such as Na$^+$-mediated action potentials) attenuate very
steeply with distance, while slower (K$^+$-mediated) events propagate over
larger distances in extracellular space, in qualitative agreement with
experimental observations. This simple model can be used to obtain
frequency-dependent extracellular field potentials without taking into account
explicitly the complex folding of extracellular space.

$V_a(\rho)=-a^2g_a\rho^{2(a-1)}$ ($a\not=0$ and $\rho=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$) have
zero-energy eigenstates that degenerate infinitely for all $a$. It is shown
that stable standing waves constructed from the zero-energy flows are confined

Vortex patterns awoken in the units by stimuli correspond to the memories of

elements in a network. We construct here the information theoretic analog of
connected correlation functions: irreducible $N$--point correlation is measured
by a decrease in entropy for the joint distribution of $N$ variables relative
to the maximum entropy allowed by all the observed $N-1$ variable
distributions. We calculate the ``connected information'' terms for several
examples, and show that it also enables the decomposition of the information
that is carried by a population of elements about an outside source.

described upon its discovery over one hundred years ago, the precise
biomechanical and biophysical properties of trypanosome flagellar motion has
not been elucidated. In this study, we describe five different modes of
flagellar beat/wave patterns in African trypanosomes by microscopically
examining the flagellar movements of chemically tethered cells. The dynamic
nature of the different beat/wave patterns suggests that flagellar motion in
Trypanosoma brucei is a complex mixture of oscillating waves, rigid bends,
helical twists and non-linear waves. Interestingly, we have observed
soliton-like depression waves along the flagellar membrane, suggesting a
nonlinear mechanism for the dynamics of this system. The physical model is
inspired by the 2-dimensional elastic dynamics of a beam, and by taking into
account uniform distribution of molecular motors torque and nonlinear terms in
the curvature.

acoustic (Love mode acoustic wave device) real-time measurements on a same
surface for the identification of water content in collagen and fibrinogen
protein layers. After calibration of the surface acoustic wave device
sensitivity by copper electrodeposition, the bound mass and its physical
properties -- density and optical index -- are extracted from the complementary
measurement techniques and lead to thickness and water ratio values compatible
with the observed signal shifts. Such results are especially usefully for
protein layers with a high water content as shown here for collagen on an
hydrophobic surface. We obtain the following results: collagen layers include
70+/-20 % water and are 16+/-3 to 19+/-3 nm thick for bulk concentrations
ranging from 30 to 300 ug/ml. Fibrinogen layers include 50+/-10 % water for
layer thicknesses in the 6+/-1.5 to 13+/-2 nm range when the bulk concentration

interaction potential. We perform discrete molecular dynamics folding
simulations of a small 20 residue protein - Trp-cage - from a fully extended
conformation. We demonstrate the ability of the Trp-cage model to consistently
reach conformations within 2angstrom backbone root-mean-square distance (RMSD)
from the corresponding NMR structures. The minimum RMSD of Trp-cage
conformations in the simulation can be smaller than 1.00angstrom. Our findings
suggest that, at least for the case of Trp-cage, a detailed all-atom protein
model with a physical molecular mechanics force field is not necessary to reach
the native state of a protein. Our results also suggest that the success
folding Trp-cage in our simulations and in the reported all-atom molecular
mechanics simulations studies may be mainly due to the special stabilizing
features specific to this miniprotein.

the complex potential energy surfaces associated with dense fluids. The search
is done in the configurational space of the translational and rotational
degrees of freedom of the molecule, combining steepest-descent and
Newton-Raphson steps which embed information on the average sizes of the
potential energy wells obtained from prior inspection of the liquid structure.
We perform a molecular dynamics simulation of a liquid water shell which
demonstrates that the method enables fast and energy-controlled water molecule
insertion in aqueous environments. The algorithm finds low energy
configurations of incoming water molecules around three orders of magnitude
faster than direct random insertion.
  This method is an important step towards dynamic simulations of open systems
and it may also prove useful for energy-biased ensemble average calculations of
the chemical potential.

single-particle and collective effects of the underlying radiobiological
mechanism. The probabilities of individual particles to form severe damages to
DNA, their synergetic or saturation combinations, and the effect of cellular
repair system are taken into account. The model enables to describe linear,
parabolic and more complex curves, including those exhibiting low-dose
hypersensitivity phenomena, in a systematic way. Global shape as well as
detailed structure of survival curves might be represented, which is crucial if
different fractionation schemes in radiotherapy should be assessed precisely.
Experimental cell-survival data for inactivation of V79 cells by low-energy

issues of interest in hadron radiotherapy, a simple physical model is used.
Energy loss, its straggling, and the attenuation of the primary particle
fluence are represented in a simplified way, based on semi-phenomenological
formulas and energy-loss tables. An effective version of the radiobiological

  ionizing radiation"	"  Although DNA damage is widely viewed as a critical target for the induction
of cell killing by ionizing radiation, the exact nature of DNA damage
responsible for these effects is unknown. To address this issue, the
probability of forming lethal damage by single proton tracks, derived from
published survival data for Chinese hamster V79 cells irradiated by protons
with energies from 0.57 to 5.01 MeV, has been compared to estimated yields of
clustered DNA lesions and repair outcomes calculated with Monte Carlo models.
The reported studies provide new information about the potential relationship
between the induction and repair of clustered DNA damage and trends in the
expected number of lethal events for protons with increasing linear energy
transfer (LET). A good correlation was found between the number of lethal
events in V79 cells and the induction of double-strand breaks (DSBs) consisting
of 3 or more elementary DNA lesions. For the yields of other types of DNA
damage, as well as point mutations formed through the misrepair of base damage
and single-strand breaks, observed trends with increasing LET are not
consistent with trends in the yields of lethal events. This observation
suggests that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of protons of varying
quality may be more closely related to the induction of complex DSBs rather
than other forms of damage.

spinal cord injuries and new approaches to prevent this pathology are
necessary. An innovative health strategy is being developed through the use of
computer and sensory substitution via the tongue in order to compensate for the
sensory loss in the buttock area for individuals with paraplegia. This sensory
compensation will enable individuals with spinal cord injuries to be aware of a
localized excess of pressure at the skin/seat interface and, consequently, will
enable them to prevent the formation of pressure ulcers by relieving the
cutaneous area of suffering. This work reports an initial evaluation of this
approach and the feasibility of creating an adapted behavior, with a change in
pressure as a response to electro-stimulated information on the tongue.
Obtained during a clinical study in 10 healthy seated subjects, the first
results are encouraging, with 92% success in 100 performed tests. These
results, which have to be completed and validated in the paraplegic population,
may lead to a new approach to education in health to prevent the formation of
pressure ulcers within this population. Keywords: Spinal Cord Injuries,

toward an intracorporeal clinically-defined target. As this technique does not
involve cutting the body open, a visualization system is employed to provide
the surgeon with indirect visual spatial information about the intracorporeal
positions of the tool. One may consider that such systems reduce the ergonomics
of the situation as they generate a decorrelation between the actual movement
of the needle and the displayed information about this movement. The present
study aims at assessing the guidance of an intracorporeal puncture under a
lingual electrotactile sensory substitution device - the Tongue Display Unit
(TDU) - with respect to the performance evidenced under a computer-rendered
visualization system. The TDU device provides information about the deviation
of the needle movement with regard to a pre-planned ""optimal"" trajectory.
Experimental results show that - (1) the stimulations furnished by the TDU are
efficient enough to guide accurately one's puncture, - and (2) that previous
training using the visualization system does not improve performances obtained
under subsequent TDU guidance. Finally, results are discussed in terms of
efficiency and usability of the TDU in the context of guiding

We then test our results on community-structured, specifically designed
artificial networks, finding perfect agreement with the observations in the

games on model networks and their interpretation in terms of global properties
may not be sufficient to study specific, real social systems. In addition, the
community perspective may be helpful to interpret the origin and behavior of

Nowadays, the Computer Assisted Surgery proposes to integrate 3D cameras in the
operating theatre in order to assist the surgeon in performing minimal-invasive
surgical punctures. The cameras localize the needle and the computer guides the
surgeon towards an intracorporeal clinically-defined target. A visualization
system (screen) is employed to provide the surgeon with indirect visual spatial
information about the intracorporeal positions of the needle. The present work
proposes to use another sensory modality to guide the surgeon thus keeping the
visual modality fully dedicated to the surgical gesture. For this, the sensory
substitution paradigm using the Bach-y-Rita's ""Tongue Display Unit"" (TDU) is
exploited to provide to the surgeon information of the position tool. The TDU
device is composed of a 6x6 matrix of electrodes transmitting electrotactile
information on the tongue surface. The underlying idea consists in transmitting
information about the deviation of the needle movement with regard to a
pre-planned ""optimal"" trajectory. We present an experiment assessing the
guidance effectiveness of an intracorporeal puncture under TDU guidance with
respect to the performance evidenced under a usual visual guidance system.

physics/9807001	q-bio	physics.chem-ph physics.bio-ph q-bio	Hydrophobic Effects on a Molecular Scale	"  A theoretical approach is developed to quantify hydrophobic hydration and
interactions on a molecular scale, with the goal of gaining insight into the
molecular origins of hydrophobic effects. The model is based on the fundamental
relation between the probability for cavity formation in bulk water resulting
from molecular-scale density fluctuations, and the hydration free energy of the
simplest hydrophobic solute, a hard particle. This probability is estimated
using an information theory (IT) approach, incorporating experimentally
available properties of bulk water -- the density and radial distribution
function. The IT approach reproduces the simplest hydrophobic effects:
hydration of spherical nonpolar solutes, the potential of mean force between
methane molecules, and solvent contributions to the torsional equilibrium of
butane. Applications of this approach to study temperature and pressure effects
provide new insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding.
The IT model relates the hydrophobic-entropy convergence observed in protein
unfolding experiments to the macroscopic isothermal compressibility of water. A
novel explanation for pressure denaturation of proteins follows from an
analysis of the pressure stability of hydrophobic aggregates, suggesting that
water penetrates the hydrophobic core of proteins at high pressures. This
resolves a long-standing puzzle, whether pressure denaturation contradicts the
hydrophobic-core model of protein stability. Finally, issues of ``dewetting''
of molecularly large nonpolar solutes are discussed in the context of a
recently developed perturbation theory approach.

entropy (P. Saparin et al., Chaos, Solitons & Fractals 4, 1907 (1994)) and
applied to several physiological time sequences, including EEGs of patients
with epilepsy. We show here that this measure is just a modified
Kullback-Leibler (K-L) relative entropy, and it gives similar numerical results
to the standard K-L entropy. The latter better distinguishes frequency contents
of e.g. seizure and background EEGs than renormalized entropy. We thus propose
that renormalized entropy might not be as useful as claimed by its proponents.

Changing conditions such as temperature variations and/or alterations in the
environment's resource composition lead to both non-constant replication and
decay rates of the molecules. In general, therefore, molecular evolution takes
place in a dynamic rather than a static fitness landscape. We incorporate
dynamic replication and decay rates into the standard quasispecies theory of
molecular evolution, and show that for periodic time-dependencies, a system of
evolving molecules enters a limit cycle for $t\to\infty$. For fast periodic
changes, we show that molecules adapt to the time-averaged fitness landscape,
whereas for slow changes they track the variations in the landscape arbitrarily
closely. We derive a general approximation method that allows us to calculate
the attractor of time-periodic landscapes, and demonstrate using several
examples that the results of the approximation and the limiting cases of very
slow and very fast changes are in perfect agreement. We also discuss landscapes
with arbitrary time dependencies, and show that very fast changes again lead to
a system that adapts to the time-averaged landscape. Finally, we analyze the
dynamics of a finite population of molecules in a dynamic landscape, and
discuss its relation to the infinite population limit.

be the basic building blocks of the eumelanins, a class of bio-macromolecules
with important biological functions (including photoprotection) and with
potential for certain bioengineering applications. We have used the DeltaSCF
(difference of self consistent fields) method to study the energy gap between
the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied

SQ but approximately twice as large in HQ. This may have important implications
for our understanding of the observed broad band optical absorption of the
eumelanins. The possibility of using this difference in Delta_HL to molecularly
engineer the electronic properties of eumelanins is discussed. We calculate the
infrared and Raman spectra of the three redox forms from first principles. Each
of the molecules have significantly different infrared and Raman signatures,
and so these spectra could be used in situ to non-destructively identify the
monomeric content of macromolecules. It is hoped that this may be a helpful

hence in helping to determine the structure-property-function relationships

important. Such a simplified model is essential for efficient search of

the combination of descriptors derived from residue-residue contact and
sequence-dependent local geometry. The optimal weight coefficients for contact
and local geometry is obtained through optimization by maximizing margins among
native and decoy structures. The latter are generated by chain growth and by
gapless threading. The performance of the potential function in blind test of
discriminating native protein structures from decoys is evaluated using several
benchmark decoy sets. This potential function have comparable or better

unknown because current detection methods can miss many occurances, mistaking
random repeats as circular permutation. Here we develop a method for detecting
circularly permuted proteins from structural comparison. Sequence order
independent alignment of protein structures can be regarded as a special case
of the maximum-weight independent set problem, which is known to be
computationally hard. We develop an efficient approximation algorithm by
repeatedly solving relaxations of an appropriate intermediate integer

q-bio/0409029	q-bio	q-bio.BM nlin.AO	"Representation of protein structure based on frequency distributions of

representation of protein folds based on simple observables defined as
frequencies of oriented cycles in contact graphs. Motivated by the idea that
these cycles may form a code of the entire protein structure we investigate its
Shannon entropy. The latter shows a characteristic transitory behavior when
traced over different values of the geometric threshold $t$ which defines
protein residues in contact. To account for this observation, we propose a
non-linear mechanical model-- formulated as a Hamiltonian system in which $t$
is regarded as a continuous parameter-- that allows to identify the behavior of
the Shannon entropy as a first-order phase transition between a disordered and
an ordered phase of the proposed mechanical system. The transition itself
reflects the formation of protein structure when represented in terms of
contact graph cycles, and it is identified as an example of a fragmentation
transition known from several other statistical systems without a proper
thermodynamic limit. Some interesting implications follow from our model
including chirality, broken $t$-symmetry and one-dimensionality. Although
defined from purely structural considerations, we further show that for native
protein structures these observables follow some of the quantitative rules that
are typically valid for amino acid types in protein sequences. Moreover, this
relation between polypeptide structures and their amino acid sequences suggests
a specific protein design alphabet.

is approximately logarithmic, suggesting a functional role for electrical
coupling. For a fixed number of neurons, the dynamical range displays a maximum
as a function of the refractory period, which suggests experimental tests for
the model. A biological application to ephaptic interactions in olfactory nerve
fascicles is proposed.

q-bio/0410013	q-bio	q-bio.PE q-bio.GN	Synonymous codon usage and selection on proteins	"  Selection pressures on proteins are usually measured by comparing homologous
nucleotide sequences (Zuckerkandl and Pauling 1965). Recently we introduced a
novel method, termed `volatility', to estimate selection pressures on protein
sequences from their synonymous codon usage (Plotkin and Dushoff 2003, Plotkin
et al 2004a). Here we provide a theoretical foundation for this approach. We
derive the expected frequencies of synonymous codons as a function of the
strength of selection, the mutation rate, and the effective population size. We
analyze the conditions under which we can expect to draw inferences from biased
codon usage, and we estimate the time scales required to establish and maintain
such a signal. Our results indicate that, over a broad range of parameters,
synonymous codon usage can reliably distinguish between negative selection,
positive selection, and neutrality. While the power of volatility to detect
negative selection depends on the population size, there is no such dependence
for the detection of positive selection. Furthermore, we show that phenomena
such as transient hyper-mutators in microbes can improve the power of
volatility to detect negative selection, even when the typical observed neutral
site heterozygosity is low.

  methods"	"  Exact numerical methods and stochastic simulation methods are developed to
study the force stretching single RNA issue on the secondary structure level in
equilibrium. By computing the force-extension curves on the constant force and
the constant extension ensembles, we find the two independent methods agree
with each other quite well. To show the precision of our methods in predicting
unfolding experiments, the unfolding forces of different RNA molecules under
different experimental conditions are calculated. We find that the ionic
corrections on the RNA free energies alone might not account for the apparent
differences between the theoretical calculations and the experimental data; an
ionic correction to the persistent length of single-stranded RNA should be
necessary.

q-bio/0501012	q-bio	q-bio.GN	"A New Simulated Annealing Algorithm for the Multiple Sequence Alignment
  Problem: The approach of Polymers in a Random Media"	"  We proposed a probabilistic algorithm to solve the Multiple Sequence
Alignment problem. The algorithm is a Simulated Annealing (SA) that exploits
the representation of the Multiple Alignment between $D$ sequences as a
directed polymer in $D$ dimensions. Within this representation we can easily
track the evolution in the configuration space of the alignment through local
moves of low computational cost. At variance with other probabilistic
algorithms proposed to solve this problem, our approach allows for the creation
and deletion of gaps without extra computational cost. The algorithm was tested
aligning proteins from the kinases family. When D=3 the results are consistent
with those obtained using a complete algorithm. For $D>3$ where the complete
algorithm fails, we show that our algorithm still converges to reasonable
alignments. Moreover, we study the space of solutions obtained and show that
depending on the number of sequences aligned the solutions are organized in
different ways, suggesting a possible source of errors for progressive
algorithms.

  Guidlines"	"  In biology experiments, oligonucleotide microarrays are contacted with a
solution of long nucleic acid (NA) targets. The hybridized probes thus carry
long tails. When the surface density of the oligonucleotide probes is high
enough, the progress of hybridization leads to the formation of a
polyelectrolyte brush due to mutual crowding of the NA tails. The free energy
penalty associated with the brush modifies both the hybridization isotherms and
the rate equations: the attainable hybridization is lowered significantly as is
the hybridization rate. While the equilibrium hybridization fraction, $x_{eq}$,
is low, the hybridization follows a Langmuir type isotherm, $x_{eq}/(1-x_{eq})
= c_t K$ where $c_t$ is the target concentration and $K$ is the equilibrium
constant smaller than its bulk value by a factor $(n/N)^{2/5}$ due to wall
effects where $n$ and $N$ denote the number of bases in the probe and the
target. At higher $x_{eq}$, when the brush is formed, the leading correction is
$x_{eq}/(1-x_{eq}) = c_t K \exp [ - const' (x_{eq}^{2/3} - x_B^{2/3})]$ where
$x_B$ corresponds to the onset of the brush regime. The denaturation rate
constant in the two regimes are identical. However, the hybridization rate
constant in the brush regime is lower, the leading correction being $\exp [-
const' (x^{2/3} - x_B^{2/3})]$.

  Eukaryotes"	"  The initial analysis of the recently sequenced genome of Acanthamoeba
polyphaga Mimivirus, the largest known double-stranded DNA virus, predicted a
proteome of size and complexity more akin to small parasitic bacteria than to
other nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses, and identified numerous functions
never before described in a virus. It has been proposed that the Mimivirus
lineage could have emerged before the individualization of cellular organisms
from the 3 domains of life. An exhaustive in silico analysis of the non-coding
moiety of all known viral genomes, now uncovers the unprecedented perfect
conservation of a AAAATTGA motif in close to 50% of the Mimivirus genes. This
motif preferentially occurs in genes transcribed from the predicted leading
strand and is associated with functions required early in the viral infectious
cycle, such as transcription and protein translation. A comparison with the
known promoter of unicellular eukaryotes, in particular amoebal protists,
strongly suggests that the AAAATTGA motif is the structural equivalent of the
TATA box core promoter element. This element is specific to the Mimivirus
lineage, and may correspond to an ancestral promoter structure predating the
radiation of the eukaryotic kingdoms. This unprecedented conservation of core
promoter regions is another exceptional features of Mimivirus, that again
raises the question of its evolutionary origin.

  V1"	"  Neural mechanisms of extraclassical receptive field phenomena in V1 are
commonly assumed to result from long-range lateral connections and/or
extrastriate feedback. We address two such phenomena: surround suppression and
contrast dependent receptive field size. We present rigorous computational
support for the hypothesis that the phenomena largely result from local
short-range (< 0.5 mm) cortical connections and LGN input. Surround suppression
in our simulations results from (A) direct cortical inhibition or (B)
suppression of recurrent cortical excitation, or (C) action of both these
mechanisms simultaneously. Mechanisms B and C are substantially more prevalent
than A. We observe an average growth in the range of spatial summation of
excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs for low contrast. However, we find
this is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain contrast dependent
receptive field size, which usually involves additional changes in the relative
gain of these inputs.

  disease in Sweden"	"  Travel restrictions may reduce the spread of a contagious disease that
threatens public health. In this study we investigate what effect different
levels of travel restrictions may have on the speed and geographical spread of
an outbreak of a disease similar to SARS. We use a stochastic simulation model
of the Swedish population, calibrated with survey data of travel patterns
between municipalities in Sweden collected over three years. We find that a ban
on journeys longer than 50 km drastically reduces the speed and the
geographical spread of outbreaks, even with when compliance is less than 100%.
The result is found to be robust for different rates of inter-municipality
transmission intensities. Travel restrictions may therefore be an effective way
to mitigate the effect of a future outbreak.

modelled as a Markov process, fitness functions are of Hopfield type, where the
fitness of a sequence is determined by the Hamming distances to a number of
predefined patterns. Using a maximum principle for the population mean fitness
in equilibrium, the error threshold phenomenon is studied for quadratic
Hopfield-type fitness functions with small numbers of patterns. Different from
previous investigations of the Hopfield model, the system shows error threshold
behaviour not for all fitness functions, but only for certain parameter values.

DNA virus. Its particle size (>400 nm), genome length (1.2 million bp) and
large gene repertoire (911 protein coding genes) blur the established
boundaries between viruses and parasitic cellular organisms. In addition, the
analysis of its genome sequence identified new types of genes not expected to
be seen in a virus, such as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and other central
components of the translation machinery. In this article, we examine how the
finding of a giant virus for the first time overlapping with the world of
cellular organisms in terms of size and genome complexity might durably
influence the way we look at microbial biodiversity, and force us to
fundamentally revise our classification of life forms. We propose to introduce
the word ""girus"" to recognize the intermediate status of these giant DNA
viruses, the genome complexity of which make them closer to small parasitic
prokaryotes than to regular viruses.

equalization of the mean payoffs per move of both players. In the case of
symmetric, non-cooperative and dilemmatic games, we show that generalized

inhomogeneous tumor specific capillary network is described by a theoretical
model incorporating tumor growth, vessel cooption, neo-vascularization, vessel
collapse and cell death. Compartmentalization of the tumor into several regions
differing in vessel density, diameter and in necrosis is observed for a wide
range of parameters in agreement with the vessel morphology found in human
melanoma. In accord with data for human melanoma the model predicts, that
microvascular density (MVD, regarded as an important diagnostic tool in cancer
treatment, does not necessarily determine the tempo of tumor progression.
Instead it is suggested, that the MVD of the original tissue as well as the
metabolic demand of the individual tumor cell plays the major role in the
initial stages of tumor growth.

  elegans natural populations"	"  Background: Caenorhabditis elegans is a major model system in biology, yet
very little is known about its biology outside the laboratory. Especially, its
unusual mode of reproduction with self-fertile hermaphrodites and facultative
males raises the question of its frequency of outcrossing in natural
populations. Results: We describe the first analysis of C. elegans individuals
sampled directly from natural populations. C. elegans is found predominantly in
the dauer stage and with a very low frequency of males compared with
hermaphrodites. While C. elegans was previously shown to display a low
worldwide genetic diversity, we find by comparison a surprisingly high local
genetic diversity of C. elegans populations; this local diversity is
contributed in great part by immigration of new alleles rather than by
mutation. Our results on heterozygote frequency, male frequency and linkage
disequilibrium furthermore show that selfing is the predominant mode of
reproduction in C. elegans natural populations, yet that infrequent outcrossing
events occur, at a rate of approximately 1%. Conclusions: Our results give a
first insight in the biology of C. elegans in the natural populations. They
demonstrate that local populations of C. elegans are genetically diverse and
that a low frequency of outcrossing allows for the recombination of these
locally diverse genotypes.

different intercellular signaling events during the development of a given
animal. For example, Wnt signaling is recruited, sometimes redundantly with
other molecular pathways, in four cell specification events during
Caenorhabditis elegans vulva development, including the activation of vulval
differentiation. Strikingly, a recent study finds that Wnts act to repress
vulval differentiation in the nematode Pristionchus pacificus, demonstrating

concern the combinatorial problem of reconstructing haplotypes from incomplete
and/or imperfectly sequenced haplotype fragments. We consider the complexity of
the problems Minimum Error Correction (MEC) and Longest Haplotype
Reconstruction (LHR) for different restrictions on the input data.
Specifically, we look at the gapless case, where every row of the input
corresponds to a gapless haplotype-fragment, and the 1-gap case, where at most
one gap per fragment is allowed. We prove that MEC is APX-hard in the 1-gap
case and still NP-hard in the gapless case. In addition, we question earlier
claims that MEC is NP-hard even when the input matrix is restricted to being
completely binary. Concerning LHR, we show that this problem is NP-hard and
APX-hard in the 1-gap case (and thus also in the general case), but is
polynomial time solvable in the gapless case.

q-bio/0509030	q-bio	q-bio.GN	"Domesticated P elements in the Drosophila montium species subgroup have
  a new function related to a DNA binding property"	"  Molecular domestication of a transposable element is defined as its
functional recruitment by the host genome. To date, two independent events of
molecular domestication of the P transposable element have been described: in
the Drosophila obscura species group and in the Drosophila montium species
subgroup. These P neogenes consist to stationary, non repeated sequences,
potentially encoding 66 kDa repressor-like proteins (RLs). Here we investigate
the function of the montium P neogenes. We provide evidence for the presence of
RLs proteins in two montium species (D. tsacasi and D. bocqueti) specifically
expressed in adult and larval brain and gonads. We tested the hypothesis that
the montium P neogenes function is related to the repression of the
transposition of distant related mobile P elements which coexist in the genome.
Our results strongly suggest that the montium P neogenes are not recruited to
down regulate the P element transposition. Given that all the proteins encoded
by mobile or stationary P homologous sequences show a strong conservation of
the DNA Binding Domain, we tested the capacity of the RLs proteins to bind DNA
in vivo. Immunstaining of polytene chromosomes in D. melanogaster transgenic
lines strongly suggest that montium P neogenes encode proteins that bind DNA in
vivo. RLs proteins show multiple binding to the chromosomes. We suggest that
the property recruited in the case of the montium P neoproteins is their DNA
binding property. The possible functions of these neogenes are discussed.

different organisms can be calculated in O(N+hM^2) time and O(N+M^2) space,
where N is the number of organisms, $h$ is the height of the phylogeny, and M
is the sum of family sizes. We apply the model to the evolution of gene content

  in mitochondrial genome sequences is related to the physical properties of
  the amino acids and to the structure of the genetic code"	"  The frequencies of A, C, G and T in mitochondrial DNA vary among species due
to unequal rates of mutation between the bases. The frequencies of bases at
four-fold degenerate sites respond directly to mutation pressure. At 1st and
2nd positions, selection reduces the degree of frequency variation. Using a
simple evolutionary model, we show that 1st position sites are less constrained
by selection than 2nd position sites, and therefore that the frequencies of
bases at 1st position are more responsive to mutation pressure than those at
2nd position. We define a similarity measure between amino acids that is a
function of 8 measured physical properties. We define a proximity measure for
each amino acid, which is the average similarity between an amino acid and all
others that are accessible via single point mutations in the genetic code. We
also define a responsiveness for each amino acid, which measures how rapidly an
amino acid frequency changes as a result of mutation pressure acting on the
base frequencies. There is a strong correlation between responsiveness and
proximity, and both these quantities are also correlated with the mutability of
amino acids estimated from the mtREV substitution rate matrix. We also consider
the variation of base frequencies between strands and between genes on a
strand. These trends are consistent with the patterns expected from analysis of
the variation among genomes

formation of the corresponding giant components and minimum spanning trees. By

redefined in a phenotype space where mutants have properties correlated to
their parents. The model has individual-based dynamics whilst incorporating
species scale competitive constraints and a system scale resource constraint.
Multiple species arise that coexist in a species interaction network with
evolving global properties. Both the mean interaction strength and the network
connectance increase relative to the null system as mutualism becomes more
extensive. From a study of the dependence of average degree on the resource
level we extract the diversity-connectance relationship which conforms to the
hyperbolic form seen in field data. This is adjudged to arise as a consequence
of the evolutionary pressure to achieve positive interactions. The network
degree distributions conform more strongly to exponential than to the null
binomial distributions in all cases. This effect is believed to be caused by
correlations in the reproductive process. We also study how resource
availability influences the phenotypical lifetime distribution which is
approximately of power law form. We observe that the mean lifetime is inversely
related to the resource level.

saturates in time, indicating the existence of a spatial scale which could, in
principle, be the home range of the rodents. This home range is concluded to be
of the order of 70 meters. Theoretical analysis is provided for interpreting
animal movement data in terms of an interplay of the home ranges, the diffusion
constant, and the size of the grid used to monitor the movement. The study

probability of the rare cellular states that allow epigenetic escape, and the

paper we introduce a deterministic model of primitive replicating aggregates,
proto-organisms, that host populations of replicating information carrying
molecules. Some of the molecules promote the reproduction of the proto-organism
at the cost of their individual replication rate. A situation resembling that
of group selection arises. We derive and analytically solve a partial
differential equation that describes the system. We find that the relative
prevalence of fast and slow replicators is determined by the relative strength
of selection at the aggregate level to the selection strength at the molecular
level. The analysis is concluded by a preliminary treatment of finite
population size effects.

hymenopteran males are usually haploid and females diploid. Males of the
Ichneumonidae Diadromus pulchellus, solitary endoparasitoid of A. assectella
pupae are normally haploid, but diploid males are present in a natural
population and can be obtained in a experimental population. The future of an
ovocyte laid by mated females of the solitary endoparasitoid Diadromus
pulchellus was characterised by 6 probabilities related to the sex and the
development of the ovocyte. The probabilities of fertilisation of female
ovocyte (k1) or non-fertilisation (k3) showed that an inseminated female
functioned as a unmated female for half of the time (since k1= 0.492 and k3 =
0.455) with the probability of fertilisation of male ovocyte (k2 = 0.053).The
survival probabilities of each type of ovocyte showed that an ovocyte had a
high probability of developing up to the adult stage, although the difference
between the calculated sex ratios at laying (males / females = 1.032) and at
emergence (0.90) revealed a slight reduction in the number of haploid sons. The
probabilities of fertilisation and of viability of all the ovocytes laid by
each of the 33 mated females were analysed by an ascending hierarchical
classification of Euclidean distances and by an analysis of their principal
components. The 33 mothers were distributed into 4 distinct sub-groups
characterised by a sex ratio varying from an exclusive presence of females to
an exclusive presence of males. Our hypothesis was that this distribution in 4
sub-sets could not simply result from the random nature of the sample.

indicated by the MBP ratio of left-toright, occurred in the cingulum at 48
(1.27 +- 0.12) and 72 (1.30 +- 0.18, p<0.05) hours of recovery as compared to
age-matched controls (1.03 +- 0.14). Ki-67 immunostaining revealed a first peak
of newly-generated cells in the dorsolateral hippocampal subventricular zone
and cingulum at 72 hours after reperfusion. Double immunofluorescence revealed
that most of the Ki-67-positive cells were astrocytes at 48 hours and NG2
pre-oligodendrocytes at 72 hours of recovery. Microglia infiltration occurs
over several days in the cingulum and a huge quantity of macrophages reached
the subcortical white matter where they engulfed immature oligodendrocytes. The
overall results suggest that the persistent activation of microglia involves a
chronic component of immunoinflammation, which overwhelms repair processes and
contributes to cystic growth in the developing brain.

general laws in biology may exist, opinions opposing such suggestion are
abundant. Based on recent progress in both mathematics and biology, another
attempt to address this issue is made in the present article. Specifically,
three laws which form a mathematical framework for the evolutionary dynamics in
biology are postulated. The second law is most quantitative and is explicitly
expressed in the unique form of a stochastic differential equation. Salient
features of Darwinian evolutionary dynamics are captured by this law: the
probabilistic nature of evolution, ascendancy, and the adaptive landscape. Four
dynamical elements are introduced in this formulation: the ascendant matrix,
the transverse matrix, the Wright evolutionary potential, and the stochastic
drive. The first law may be regarded as a special case of the second law. It
gives the reference point to discuss the evolutionary dynamics. The third law
describes the relationship between the focused level of description to its
lower and higher ones, and defines the dichotomy of deterministic and
stochastic drives. It is an acknowledgement of the hierarchical structure in
biology. A new interpretation of Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural
selection is provided in terms of the F-Theorem. The proposed laws are based on
continuous representation in both time and population. Their generic nature is
demonstrated through their equivalence to classical formulations. The present
three laws appear to provide a coherent framework for the further development
of the subject.

q-bio/0606018	q-bio	q-bio.QM	"Does Logarithm Transformation of Microarray Data Affect Ranking Order of
  Differentially Expressed Genes?"	"  A common practice in microarray analysis is to transform the microarray raw
data (light intensity) by a logarithmic transformation, and the justification
for this transformation is to make the distribution more symmetric and
Gaussian-like. Since this transformation is not universally practiced in all
microarray analysis, we examined whether the discrepancy of this treatment of
raw data affect the ""high level"" analysis result. In particular, whether the
differentially expressed genes as obtained by $t$-test, regularized t-test, or
logistic regression have altered rank orders due to presence or absence of the
transformation. We show that as much as 20%--40% of significant genes are
""discordant"" (significant only in one form of the data and not in both),
depending on the test being used and the threshold value for claiming
significance. The t-test is more likely to be affected by logarithmic
transformation than logistic regression, and regularized $t$-test more affected
than t-test. On the other hand, the very top ranking genes (e.g. up to top
20--50 genes, depending on the test) are not affected by the logarithmic
transformation.

  Longitudinal Study"	"  The staggerer (sg/sg) mutation is a spontaneous deletion in the Rora gene
that prevents the translation of the ligand-binding domain (LBD), leading to
the loss of ROR\alpha activity. The homozygous Rorasg/sg mutant mouse, whose
most obvious phenotype is ataxia associated with cerebellar degeneration, also
displays a variety of other phenotypes. The heterozygous Rora+/sg is able to
develop a cerebellum which is qualitatively normal but with advancing age
suffers a significant loss of cerebellar neuronal cells. A truncated protein
synthesized by the mutated allele may play a role, both in Rorasg/sg and
Rora+/sg. To determine the effects during life span of true haplo-insufficiency
of the ROR\alpha protein, derived from the invalidation of the gene, we
compared the evolution of Purkinje cell numbers in heterozygous Rora knock-out
males (Rora+/-) and in their wildtype counterparts from 1 to 24 months of age.
We also compared the evolution of Purkinje cell numbers in Rora+/- and Rora+/sg
males from 1 to 9 months. The main finding is that in Rora+/- mice, when only a
half dose of protein is synthesized, the deficit was already established at 1
month and did not change during life span....

  Control"	"  With this paper we propose a model to simulate the functional aspects of
light adaptation in retinal photoreceptors. Our model, however, does not link
specific stages to the detailed molecular processes which are thought to
mediate adaptation in real photoreceptors. We rather model the photoreceptor as
a self-adjusting integration device, which adds up properly amplified luminance
signals. The integration process and the amplification obey a switching
behavior that acts to locally shut down the integration process in dependence
on the internal state of the receptor. The mathematical structure of our model
is quite simple, and its computational complexity is quite low. We present
results of computer simulations which demonstrate that our model adapts
properly to at least four orders of input magnitude.

q-bio/0609024	q-bio	q-bio.QM	Graph kernels based on tree patterns for molecules	"  Motivated by chemical applications, we revisit and extend a family of
positive definite kernels for graphs based on the detection of common subtrees,
initially proposed by Ramon et al. (2003). We propose new kernels with a
parameter to control the complexity of the subtrees used as features to
represent the graphs. This parameter allows to smoothly interpolate between
classical graph kernels based on the count of common walks, on the one hand,
and kernels that emphasize the detection of large common subtrees, on the other
hand. We also propose two modular extensions to this formulation. The first
extension increases the number of subtrees that define the feature space, and
the second one removes noisy features from the graph representations. We
validate experimentally these new kernels on binary classification tasks
consisting in discriminating toxic and non-toxic molecules with support vector
machines.

q-bio/0610021	q-bio	q-bio.GN	Cell wall proteins: a new insight through proteomics	"  Cell wall proteins are essential constituents of plant cell walls; they are
involved in modifications of cell wall components, wall structure, signaling
and interactions with plasma membrane proteins at the cell surface. The
application of proteomic approaches to the cell wall compartment raises
important questions: are there technical problems specific to cell wall
proteomics? What kinds of proteins can be found in Arabidopsis walls? Are some
of them unexpected? What sort of post-translational modifications have been
characterized in cell wall proteins to date? The purpose of this review is to
discuss the experimental results obtained to date using proteomics, as well as
some of the new questions challenging future research.

q-bio/0610022	q-bio	q-bio.GN	"Evaluation of cell wall preparations for proteomics: a new procedure for
  purifying cell walls from Arabidopsis hypocotyls"	"  The ultimate goal of proteomic analysis of a cell compartment should be the
exhaustive identification of resident proteins; excluding proteins from other
cell compartments. Plant cell walls possess specific difficulties. Several
reported procedures to isolate cell walls for proteomic analyses led to the
isolation of a high proportion (more than 50%) of predicted intracellular
proteins. The rationales of several published procedures to isolate cell walls
for proteomics were analyzed, with regard to the bioinformatic-predicted
subcellular localization of the identified proteins. A new procedure was
developed to prepare cell walls from etiolated hypocotyls of Arabidopsis
thaliana. After salt extraction, a high proportion of proteins predicted to be
secreted was released (73%), belonging to the same functional classes as
proteins identified using previously described protocols. The new cell wall
preparation described in this paper gives the lowest proportion of proteins
predicted to be intracellular when compared to available protocols. The
application of its principles should lead to a more realistic view of the cell
wall proteome, at least for the weakly bound CWP extractable by salts. In
addition, it offers a clean cell wall preparation for subsequent extraction of
strongly bound CWP.

  l'autotaxine et l'acide lysophosphatidique"	"  Secretion and role of autotaxin and lysophosphatidic acid in adipose tissue
In obesity, adipocyte hypertrophy is often associated with recrutement of new
fat cells (adipogenesis) under the control of circulating and local regulatory
factors. Among the different lipids released in the extracellular compartment
of adipocytes, our group found the presence of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA
is a bioactive phospholipid able to regulate several cell responses via the
activation of specific G-protein coupled membrane receptors. Our group found
that LPA increases preadipocyte proliferation and inhibits adipogenesis via the
activation of LPA1 receptor subtype. Extracellular LPA-synthesis is catalyzed
by a lysophospholipase D secreted by adipocytes : autotaxin (ATX). Adipocyte
ATX expression strongly increases with adipogenesis as well as in individuals
exhibiting type 2 diabetes associated with massive obesity. A possible
contribution of ATX and LPA as paracrine regulators of adipogenesis and obesity
associated diabetes is proposed.

q-bio/0611010	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Immunolocalization of Na+,K+-ATPase in the branchial cavity during the
  early development of the crayfish Astacus leptodactylus (Crustacea, Decapoda)"	"  The ontogeny of osmoregulation was examined in the branchial cavity of
embryonic and early post-embryonic stages of the crayfish Astacus leptodactylus
maintained in freshwater, at the sub-cellular level through the detection of
the sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na(+),K(+)-ATPase). The
embryonic rate of development was calculated according to the eye index (EI)
which was 430-450 microm at hatching. The distribution of the enzyme was
identified by immunofluorescence microscopy using a monoclonal antibody
IgGalpha5 raised against the avian alpha-subunit of the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase.
Immunoreactivity staining, indicating the presence of Na(+), K(+)-ATPase
appeared in the gills of late embryos (EI>/=400 microm), i.e. a few days before
hatching time, and steadily increased throughout the late embryonic and early
post-embryonic development. The appearance of the enzyme correlates with the
ability to osmoregulate which also occurs late in the embryonic development at
EI 410-420 microm and with tissue differentiation within the gill filaments.
These observations indicate that the physiological shift from osmoconforming
embryos to hyper-regulating late embryos and post-hatching stages in freshwater
must originate partly from the differentiation in the gill epithelia of
ionocytes which are the site of ion pumping, as suggested by the location of
Na(+),K(+)-ATPase. Only the gills were immunostained and a lack of specific
staining was noted in the lamina and the branchiostegites. Therefore,
osmoregulation through Na(+)active uptake is likely achieved in embryos at the
gill level; all the newly formed gills in embryos function in ion regulation;
other parts of the branchial chamber such as the branchiostegites and lamina do
not appear to be involved in osmoregulation.

q-bio/0611019	q-bio	q-bio.PE	"Postprandial morphological response of the intestinal epithelium of the
  Burmese python (Python molurus)"	"  The postprandial morphological changes of the intestinal epithelium of
Burmese pythons were examined using fasting pythons and at eight time points
after feeding. In fasting pythons, tightly packed enterocytes possess very
short microvilli and are arranged in a pseudostratified fashion. Enterocyte
width increases by 23% within 24 h postfeeding, inducing significant increases
in villus length and intestinal mass. By 6 days postfeeding, enterocyte volume
had peaked, following as much as an 80% increase. Contributing to enterocyte
hypertrophy is the cellular accumulation of lipid droplets at the tips and
edges of the villi of the proximal and middle small intestine, but which were
absent in the distal small intestine. At 3 days postfeeding, conventional and
environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed cracks and lipid extrusion
along the narrow edges of the villi and at the villus tips. Transmission
electron microscopy demonstrated the rapid postprandial lengthening of
enterocyte microvilli, increasing 4.8-fold in length within 24 h, and the
maintaining of that length through digestion. Beginning at 24 h postfeeding,
spherical particles were found embedded apically within enterocytes of the
proximal and middle small intestine. These particles possessed an annular-like
construction and were stained with the calcium-stain Alizarine red S suggesting
that they were bone in origin. Following the completion of digestion, many of
the postprandial responses were reversed, as observed by the atrophy of
enterocytes, the shortening of villi, and the retraction of the microvilli.
Further exploration of the python intestine will reveal the underlying
mechanisms of these trophic responses and the origin and fate of the engulfed
particles.

  a negative feedback loop"	"  In this paper the existence and unicity of a stable periodic orbit is proven,
for a class of piecewise affine differential equations in dimension 3 or more,
provided their interaction structure is a negative feedback loop. It is also
shown that the same systems converge toward a unique stable equilibrium point
in dimension 2. This extends a theorem of Snoussi, which showed the existence
of these orbits only. The considered class of equations is usually studied as a
model of gene regulatory networks. It is not assumed that all decay rates are
identical, which is biologically irrelevant, but has been done in the vast
majority of previous studies. Our work relies on classical results about fixed
points of monotone, concave operators acting on positive variables. Moreover,
the used techniques are very likely to apply in more general contexts, opening
directions for future work.

  chestnut, mani and poplar"	"  In order to face environmental constraints, trees are able to re-orient their
axes by controlling the stress level in the newly formed wood layers.
Angiosperms and gymnosperms evolved into two distinct mechanisms: the former
produce a wood with large tension pre-stress on the upper side of the tilted
axis, while the latter produce a wood with large compression pre-stress on the
lower side. In both cases, the difference between this stress level and that of
the opposite side, in light tension, generates the bending of the axis.
However, light values of compression were sometimes measured in the opposite
side of angiosperms. By analysing old data on chestnut and mani and new data on
poplar, this study shows that these values were not measurement artefacts. This
reveals that generating light compression stress in opposite wood contributes
to improve the performance of the re-orientation mechanism.

  pharmacological data: how far are we from a chemogenomic knowledge space?"	"  The organization and mining of malaria genomic and post-genomic data is
highly motivated by the necessity to predict and characterize new biological
targets and new drugs. Biological targets are sought in a biological space
designed from the genomic data from Plasmodium falciparum, but using also the
millions of genomic data from other species. Drug candidates are sought in a
chemical space containing the millions of small molecules stored in public and
private chemolibraries. Data management should therefore be as reliable and
versatile as possible. In this context, we examined five aspects of the
organization and mining of malaria genomic and post-genomic data: 1) the
comparison of protein sequences including compositionally atypical malaria
sequences, 2) the high throughput reconstruction of molecular phylogenies, 3)
the representation of biological processes particularly metabolic pathways, 4)
the versatile methods to integrate genomic data, biological representations and
functional profiling obtained from X-omic experiments after drug treatments and
5) the determination and prediction of protein structures and their molecular
docking with drug candidate structures. Progresses toward a grid-enabled
chemogenomic knowledge space are discussed.

likely to be very difficult to achieve. However, advantage can be taken of the
cell compartmentalization to build organelle proteomes, which can moreover be
viewed as specialized tools to study specifically the biology and ""physiology""
of the target organelle. Within this frame, we report here the construction of
the human mitochondrial proteome, using placenta as the source tissue. Protein
identification was carried out mainly by peptide mass fingerprinting. The
optimization steps in two-dimensional electrophoresis needed for proteome
research are discussed. However, the relative paucity of data concerning
mitochondrial proteins is still the major limiting factor in building the
corresponding proteome, which should be a useful tool for researchers working
on human mitochondria and their deficiencies.

membrane protein solubilizers for two-dimensional electrophoresis was
investigated. Human red blood cell ghosts and Arabidopsis thaliana leaf
membrane proteins were used as model systems. Efficient detergents could be
found in each class, i.e. with oligooxyethylene, sugar or sulfobetaine polar
heads. Among the commercially available nonionic detergents, dodecyl maltoside
and decaethylene glycol mono hexadecyl ether proved most efficient. They
complement the more classical sulfobetaine detergents to widen the scope of
useful detergents for the solubilization of membrane proteins in proteomics.

apply it to all types of proteins. Unfortunately, severe solubility problems
hamper the analysis of many classes of proteins, but especially membrane
proteins. These problems arise mainly in the extraction and isoelectric
focusing steps, and solutions are sought to improve protein solubility under
the conditions prevailing during isoelectric focusing. These solutions deal
mainly with chaotropes and new detergents, which are both able to enhance
protein solubility. The input of these compounds in proteomics analysis of
membrane proteins is discussed, as well as future directions.

  two-dimensional electrophoresis"	"  The influence of thiol blocking on the resolution of basic proteins by
two-dimensional electrophoresis was investigated. Cysteine blocking greatly
increased resolution and decreased streaking, especially in the basic region of
the gels. Two strategies for cysteine blocking were found to be efficient:
classical alkylation with maleimide derivatives and mixed disulfide exchange
with an excess of a low molecular weight disulfide. The effect on resolution
was significant enough to allow correct resolution of basic proteins with
in-gel rehydration on wide gradients (e.g. 3-10 and 4-12), but anodic
cup-loading was still required for basic gradients (e.g. 6-12 or 8-12). These
results demonstrate that thiol-related problems are not solely responsible for
streaking of basic proteins on two-dimensional gels.

and the nuclear genome are functional. To investigate the importance of the
mitochondrial genome, which encodes only 13 subunits of the respiratory
complexes, the mitochondrial rRNAs and a few tRNAs, we performed a comparative
study on the 143B cell line and on its Rho-0 counterpart, i.e., devoid of
mitochondrial DNA. Quantitative differences were found, of course in the
respiratory complexes subunits, but also in the mitochondrial translation
apparatus, mainly mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, and in the ion and protein
import system, i.e., including membrane proteins. Various mitochondrial
metabolic processes were also altered, especially electron transfer proteins
and some dehydrogenases, but quite often on a few proteins for each pathway.
This study also showed variations in some hypothetical or poorly characterized
proteins, suggesting a mitochondrial localization for these proteins. Examples
include a stomatin-like protein and a protein sharing homologies with bacterial
proteins implicated in tyrosine catabolism. Proteins involved in apoptosis
control are also found modulated in Rho-0 mitochondria.

q-bio/0611082	q-bio	q-bio.GN	"High expression of antioxidant proteins in dendritic cells: possible
  implications in atherosclerosis"	"  Dendritic cells (DCs) display the unique ability to activate naive T cells
and to initiate primary T cell responses revealed in DC-T cell alloreactions.
DCs frequently operate under stress conditions. Oxidative stress enhances the
production of inflammatory cytokines by DCs. We performed a proteomic analysis
to see which major changes occur, at the protein expression level, during DC
differentiation and maturation. Comparative two-dimensional gel analysis of the
monocyte, immature DC, and mature DC stages was performed. Manganese superoxide
dismutase (Mn-SOD) reached 0.7% of the gel-displayed proteins at the mature DC
stage. This important amount of Mn-SOD is a primary antioxidant defense system
against superoxide radicals, but its product, H(2)O(2), is also deleterious for
cells. Peroxiredoxin (Prx) enzymes play an important role in eliminating such
peroxide. Prx1 expression level continuously increased during DC
differentiation and maturation, whereas Prx6 continuously decreased, and Prx2
peaked at the immature DC stage. As a consequence, DCs were more resistant than
monocytes to apoptosis induced by high amounts of oxidized low density
lipoproteins containing toxic organic peroxides and hydrogen peroxide.
Furthermore DC-stimulated T cells produced high levels of receptor activator of
nuclear factor kappaB ligand, a chemotactic and survival factor for monocytes
and DCs. This study provides insights into the original ability of DCs to
express very high levels of antioxidant enzymes such as Mn-SOD and Prx1, to
detoxify oxidized low density lipoproteins, and to induce high levels of
receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand by the T cells they activate
and further emphasizes the role that DCs might play in atherosclerosis, a
pathology recognized as a chronic inflammatory disorder.

q-bio/0611083	q-bio	q-bio.GN	"Improved mass spectrometry compatibility is afforded by ammoniacal
  silver staining"	"  Sequence coverage in MS analysis of protein digestion-derived peptides is a
key issue for detailed characterization of proteins or identification at low
quantities. In gel-based proteomics studies, the sequence coverage greatly
depends on the protein detection method. It is shown here that ammoniacal
silver detection methods offer improved sequence coverage over standard silver
nitrate methods, while keeping the high sensitivity of silver staining. With
the development of 2D-PAGE-based proteomics, another burden is placed on the
detection methods used for protein detection on 2-D-gels. Besides the classical
requirements of linearity, sensitivity, and homogeneity from one protein to
another, detection methods must now take into account another aspect, namely
their compatibility with MS. This compatibility is evidenced by two different
and complementary aspects, which are (i) the absence of adducts and artefactual
modifications on the peptides obtained after protease digestion of a protein
detected and digested in - gel, and (ii) the quantitative yield of peptides
recovered after digestion and analyzed by the mass spectrometer. While this
quantitative yield is not very important per se, it is however a crucial
parameter as it strongly influences the S/N of the mass spectrum and thus the
number of peptides that can be detected from a given protein input, especially
at low protein amounts. This influences in turn the sequence coverage and thus
the detail of the analysis provided by the mass spectrometer.

These studies showed the induction of several gene classes corresponding to
various biological functions. These functions encompass antigen processing and
presentation, cytoskeleton, cell signalling and signal transduction, but also
an increase in mitochondrial function and in the protein synthesis machinery,
including some, but not all, chaperones. These changes put in perspective the
events occurring during this differentiation process. On a more technical
point, it appears that the studies carried out at the RNA and protein levels
are highly complementary.

q-bio/0612039	q-bio	q-bio.BM	Effect of finite size on cooperativity and rates of protein folding	"  We analyze the dependence of cooperativity of the thermal denaturation
transition and folding rates of globular proteins on the number of amino acid
residues, $N$, using lattice models with side chains,off-lattice Go models and
the available experimental data. A dimensionless measure of cooperativity,
$\Omega_c$ ($0 < \Omega_c < \infty$), scales as $\Omega_c \sim N^{\zeta}$. The
results of simulations and the analysis of experimental data further confirm
the earlier prediction that $\zeta$ is universal with $\zeta = 1 +\gamma$,
where exponent $\gamma$ characterizes the susceptibility of a self-avoiding
walk. This finding suggests that the structural characteristics in the
denaturated state are manifested in the folding cooperativity at the transition
temperature. The folding rates $k_F$ for the Go models and a dataset of 69
proteins can be fit using $k_F = k_F^0 \exp(-cN^\beta)$. Both $\beta = 1/2$ and
2/3 provide a good fit of the data. We find that $k_F = k_F^0
\exp(-cN^{{1/2}})$, with the average (over the dataset of proteins) $k_F^0
\approx (0.2\mu s)^{-1}$ and $c \approx 1.1$, can be used to estimate folding
rates to within an order of magnitude in most cases. The minimal models give
identical $N$ dependence with $c \approx 1$. The prefactor for off-lattice Go
models is nearly four orders of magnitude larger than the experimental value.

  nesting season : conservation implications"	"  Despite decades of conservation efforts on the nesting beaches, the critical
status of leatherback turtles shows that their survival predominantly depends
on our ability to reduce at-sea mortality. Although areas where leatherbacks
meet fisheries have been identified during the long distance movements between
two consecutive nesting seasons, hotspots of lethal interactions are still
poorly defined within the nesting season, when individuals concentrate close to
land. Here we report movements of satellite-tracked gravid leatherback turtles
during the nesting season in Western Central Africa, South America and
Caribbean Sea, accounting for about 70% of the world population. We show that
during, and at the end of, the nesting season leatherback turtles have the
propensity to remain over the continental shelf, yet sometimes perform extended
movements and may even nest in neighbouring countries. Leatherbacks exploit
coastal commercial fishing grounds and face substantial accidental capture by
regional coastal fisheries (e.g. at least 10% in French Guiana). This
emphasises the need for regional conservation strategies to be developed at the
ocean scale, both at sea and on land, to ensure the survival of the last
leatherback turtles.

behavior are governed by the parameters of the corresponding deterministic

clear, and the frequencies of the stochastic and deterministic oscillations are
close, for all stochastic models compatible with the same deterministic one. On
the other hand, when it is large, the oscillations cannot be distinguished from

protein sparing during which energy expenditure is derived from lipid oxidation
(phase II), and a later phase characterized by a rise in plasma corticosterone
triggering protein catabolism (phase III). Such a switch in body fuel uses,
leading to changes in body reserves and gluconeogenic precursors, could
modulate intestinal gluconeogenesis and glucose transport. The gene and protein
levels, and the cellular localization of the sodium-glucose cotransporter
SGLT1, and of GLUT5 and GLUT2, as well as that of the key gluconeogenic enzymes
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc6Pase)
were measured. PEPCK and Glc6Pase activities were also determined. In phase III
fasted rats, SGLT1 was up-regulated and intestinal glucose uptake rates were
higher than in phase II fasted and fed rats. PEPCK and Glc6Pase mRNA, protein
levels and activities also increased in phase III. GLUT5 and GLUT2 were
down-regulated throughout the fast, but increased after refeeding, with GLUT2
recruited to the apical membrane. The increase in SGLT1 expression during phase
III may allow glucose absorption at low concentrations as soon as food is
available. Furthermore, an increased epithelial permeability due to fasting may
induce a paracellular movement of glucose. In the absence of intestinal GLUT2
during fasting, Glc6Pase could be involved in glucose release to the
bloodstream via membrane trafficking. Finally, refeeding triggered GLUT2 and
GLUT5 synthesis and apical recruitment of GLUT2, to absorb larger amounts of
hexoses.

q-bio/0702058	q-bio	q-bio.QM	"Symbolic Reachability Analysis of Genetic Regulatory Networks using
  Qualitative Abstractions"	"  The switch-like character of gene regulation has motivated the use of hybrid,
discrete-continuous models of genetic regulatory networks. While powerful
techniques for the analysis, verification, and control of hybrid systems have
been developed, the specificities of the biological application domain pose a
number of challenges, notably the absence of quantitative information on
parameter values and the size and complexity of networks of biological
interest. We introduce a method for the analysis of reachability properties of
genetic regulatory networks that is based on a class of discontinuous
piecewise-affine (PA) differential equations well-adapted to the above
constraints. More specifically, we introduce a hyperrectangular partition of
the state space that forms the basis for a discrete abstraction preserving the
sign of the derivatives of the state variables. The resulting discrete
transition system provides a conservative approximation of the qualitative
dynamics of the network and can be efficiently computed in a symbolic manner
from inequality constraints on the parameters. The method has been implemented
in the computer tool Genetic Network Analyzer (GNA), which has been applied to
the analysis of a regulatory system whose functioning is not well-understood by
biologists, the nutritional stress response in the bacterium Escherichia coli.

biology. Several methods have been developed for studying qualitative
properties of biological networks. Last decade had seen the improvement of
molecular techniques that make quantitative analyses reachable. One of the
major biological modelling goals is therefore to deal with the quantitative
aspect of biological graphs. We propose a probabilistic model that suits with
this quantitative aspects. Our model combines graph with several dynamical
sources. It emphazises various asymptotic statistical properties that might be
useful for giving biological insights

q-bio/0703006	q-bio	q-bio.GN	"Toward a better analysis of secreted proteins: the example of the
  myeloid cells secretome"	"  The analysis of secreted proteins represents a challenge for current
proteomics techniques. Proteins are usually secreted at low concentrations in
the culture media, which makes their recovery difficult. In addition, culture
media are rich in salts and other compounds interfering with most proteomics
techniques, which makes selective precipitation of proteins almost mandatory
for a correct subsequent proteomics analysis. Last but not least, the
non-secreted proteins liberated in the culture medium upon lysis of a few dead
cells heavily contaminate the so-called secreted proteins preparations. Several
techniques have been used in the past for concentration of proteins secreted in
culture media. These techniques present several drawbacks, such as
coprecipitation of salts or poor yields at low protein concentrations. Improved
techniques based on carrier-assisted trichloroacetic acid precipitation are
described and discussed in this paper. These techniques have been used to
analyse the secretome of myeloid cells (macrophages, dendritic cells) and
enabled to analyze proteins secreted at concentrations close to 1 ng/ml,
thereby allowing to detect some of the cytokines (TNF, IL-12) secreted by the
myeloid cells upon activation by bacterial products.
